    <title>Looking Backward: Long-Term Religious Service Attendance in 66 Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The attendance rate at religious services is an important variable for the sociology and economics of religion, but long-term and global data are scarce. Retrospective questions from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) allow the construction of rates of religious-service attendance back as far as the 1920s in 66 countries, half from the “Global South.”  A number of checks support the reliability of the retrospective information. One exercise demonstrates the consistency between retrospective and contemporaneous survey data when the two overlap. Another procedure shows that the retrospective values are similar when generated from individual ISSP surveys for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018; that is, there is no clear dependence of memory on the number of years of recall. The new data document a century-long “Great Religious Divergence” between North and South. We use the data to carry out event studies for effects on religious-service attendance of two major events.  Vatican II, in 1962-1965, triggered a decline in worldwide Catholic attendance relative to that in other denominations. In contrast, the endings of Communism in the early 1990s did not systematically affect religious-service attendance. Finally, in a large sample, religious-service attendance responds positively to wars and depressions.</content>

    <title>Frontline Leadership: Evidence from American Civil War Captains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents new evidence on the critical role of lower-level organizational leaders. Unlike top managers, frontline leaders are essential for implementing organizational strategies by maintaining team cohesion when shirking is profitable for workers. We study this in the context of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, using data on 2.2 million soldiers and tracking captains and their 100-soldier companies at weekly frequency throughout the conflict. We estimate leader fixed effects during non-combat weeks to measure leadership quality in a leader value-added framework. We validate this measure by showing that captains were not assigned based on prior unit performance or observable pre-war characteristics. High-quality leaders earned more after the war, but not before, and were more frequently recognized as good leaders in their postwar biographies. Daily event-study estimates around major battles show that better captains significantly reduced desertions in combat. Exploiting quasi-random leader turnover, we find evidence that this effect is causal. Using digitized battle maps, we rule out risk aversion as a mechanism and find instead that better leaders had higher mortality rates, consistent with a leading-by-example explanation. We also document modest learning-by-doing effects. These findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of frontline leadership, where direct supervision and interpersonal influence are strongest.</content>

    <title>The Racial Penalty in Job Ladder Transitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of job transitions and firm pay policies in the Black-White earnings gap in the US. We use administrative data for the universe of employer-employee matches from 2005-2019 to analyze worker mobility in a general but tractable framework, which allows for firm effects that depend on workers’ job history. Using differences in average pay between origin and destination firms as the treatment intensity of a job move, we analyze transitions up and down the job ladder and estimate race-specific passthrough rates of average firm pay into a mover’s own earnings. First, we find race-specific asymmetry around the direction of the move, whereby losses experienced in downward transitions are meaningfully larger than gains from upward transitions with a similar treatment intensity. For a $1 earnings increase in transitions up the job ladder, earnings passthroughs in transitions down the job ladder impose an earnings loss of $1.25 among White workers and $1.50 among Black workers. Second, we uncover career setbacks as a novel pathway in the evolution of racial earnings gaps. In transitions down the job ladder, Black workers lose an additional $0.24 for every $1 decrease in White workers’ earnings, a finding which prevails across sex and age. This “racial penalty” is not driven by differential pay, as it is completely absent when Black and White workers move between the same firm pairs. Instead, the penalty is due to differential sorting following career setbacks, so that Black workers regain employment in “worse” jobs, with strong evidence for racial differences in access to short-run liquidity as a mechanism. Overall, our findings offer a robust and computationally simple framework for modeling earnings determination processes and have implications for safety-net policies in the American labor market.</content>

    <title>Economic Crisis and Disillusionment from Socialism: Evidence From a Quasi-Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While many socialist countries suffered from harsh economic crises, studying their impacts on economic and political attitudes is challenging because of the scarcity of reliable data in nondemocratic contexts. We study a democratic socialist setting where we have ample information on such attitudes: the Israeli kibbutzim. Exploiting an economic crisis that hit some kibbutzim more than others, we find that the crisis led to reduced support for leftist political parties. This effect persisted for over 20 years after the crisis had ended. We document that the electoral movement was rooted in a rightward shift in economic attitudes, suggesting that economic crises may undermine socialist regimes by silently changing attitudes toward them. In our unique setting, we can also study recovery mechanisms from the crisis. First, we find that while a sharp debt relief arrangement restored trust in the leadership, it did not reverse the impact of the crisis on economic attitudes. Second, as part of their efforts to recover from the crisis, kibbutzim liberalized their labor markets. Analyzing the staggered shift away from equal sharing to market-based wages, we find that this labor market liberalization led kibbutz members to move further rightward in their political voting and economic attitudes.</content>

    <title>Hot Weather, Undernutrition, and Adaptation in Rural India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of temperature during the growing season on household diets in the subsequent year in rural India, a setting with a high prevalence of small family farms. High growing season temperatures reduce crop yields, which would presumably reduce incomes and home-grown food for consumption. However, household adaptation could mitigate how the reductions in yields affect diets. We find that heat increases the number of strongly undernourished households in the subsequent year, as measured by the consumption of calories, iron, zinc, thiamine, and niacin. We also find suggestive evidence that households adapt to heat-induced losses of home-grown crops by purchasing more food.</content>

    <title>ESG Aversion: Experimental Evidence on Perceptions and Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an experimental framework to identify the belief-based and taste-based drivers of demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) partnerships. Our study implements two symmetric experiments with real startup founders and venture capital (VC) investors, who evaluate hypothetical profiles under the understanding that their responses will inform an algorithm generating personalized real-world matches. We find a significant ESG penalty: profiles randomly labeled with ESG attributes receive substantially lower collaboration interest from both founders and VCs. This penalty is primarily driven by negative performance beliefs—ESG-labeled profiles are perceived as less profitable and less accessible. To isolate taste-based preferences, we further implement a willingness-to-pay experiment in which participants may forgo part of a lottery reward to receive additional match recommendations of comparable quality. Participants randomly offered ESG-oriented recommendations are now significantly more likely to pay, revealing a latent preference for ESG once performance concerns are held constant. These findings highlight a tension between financial returns and personal values: in current market conditions, concerns about profitability obscure an underlying taste for ESG.</content>

    <title>A Trade-off Between Monetary Policy Transmission and Systemic Risk in China</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Kaiji Chen, Yiqing Xiao &amp; Tao Zha</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how interbank wholesale funding shapes the transmission of interest-rate-based monetary policy in China and contributes to systemic risk. Using a bank-level quarterly panel dataset and an estimated policy rule for the 7-day repo rate, we find that access to wholesale funding amplifies the transmission of monetary policy easing to lending by non-state banks, but also heightens their vulnerability to systemic risk during economic downturns. Since 2018, non-state banks with greater reliance on wholesale funding have experienced larger increases in expected capital shortfalls. To interpret these findings, we develop a structural model that incorporates a dual-track interest rate system and a segmented deposit market. The model quantifies the role of a liquidity reallocation channel from state to non-state banks and reveals a macroprudential trade-off: tighter regulation of wholesale funding weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy but mitigates systemic risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses longitudinal data to study the benefits of participation in scholastic athletics starting with high school participation and continuing with college athletics, including the benefits of intramural athletics. We study the impact of participation on a number of important life outcomes, including graduation from high school and college and wages after schooling is completed. Controlling for rich measures of cognitive and personality skills and social background, we find substantial benefits at all levels. Participation in athletics promotes social mobility for disadvantaged and minority students.</content>

    <title>Are Hospital Acquisitions of Physician Practices Anticompetitive?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper empirically analyzes the effects of mergers between complementary firms on competition and pricing. As these non-horizontal mergers have become more common, there is increasing interest in evaluating both potential efficiencies such as eliminating double marginalization and potential anticompetitive effects such as foreclosure and recapture. The mergers we study – hospital acquisitions of physician practices – have reshaped the $1 trillion US physician industry, nearly doubling the share of physicians working for hospitals between 2008 and 2016. We combine novel data and machine learning algorithms to identify a large number of integration events, spanning a wide range of markets with different competitive circumstances. We merge the integration events with claims data from a large national insurer to study their effects on prices. Focusing on childbirths, the most ubiquitous admission among the privately insured, we find that, on average, these mergers led to price increases for hospitals and physicians of 3.3% and 15.1%, respectively, with no discernible effects on quality measures. Using demand estimation to characterize substitution patterns for both physicians and hospitals, we construct tests that demonstrate price increases are larger among transactions with greater scope for foreclosure and recapture. Our estimates suggest that the costs of these mergers of hospitals and physicians have been substantial, and our mechanism tests offer guidance in predicting where the anticompetitive effects of non-horizontal mergers are likely to be strongest.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Parenting and Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a large, randomized cash transfer on parental behaviors, investment in children, children's social, behavioral, and educational outcomes, and pregnancy and childbearing. We find that parents who were randomly selected to receive a $1,000 per month unconditional cash transfer for three years spent more on their children each month and reported better parenting behaviors (such as supervising their children more closely) compared to those randomized to receive $50 per month over the same period. However, possibly due to this closer monitoring, parents in the treatment group also reported that their child was experiencing more developmental difficulties and stress. Parents with the lowest incomes at baseline experienced the largest improvements in parenting; among these parents, the transfer also increased the use and quality of non-parental child care. The transfer did not have a meaningful effect on most educational outcomes measured in school administrative records, nor did it affect characteristics of the home environment, child food security, exposure to homelessness, or parental satisfaction. Although treated families were more likely to move, we did not detect changes in most measures of neighborhood quality, though proximity to child-focused amenities such as daycares appeared to increase in the treatment group relative to the control group. The transfer did not affect childbearing, pregnancy, or outcomes related to contraception. While the transfer reduced parents' stress and mental distress in the first year of the program, these effects were short-lived and dissipated by the second year of the transfer, analogous to what was documented previously in the full population of participants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An interconnected world increases economic efficiency while giving certain countries leverage over others. We aim to describe and understand international power stemming from trade. Using an illustrative model of trade with possibilities of bilateral disputes and ex-post hold-ups, we highlight that bilateral asymmetry in import dependence can be a source of coercive power towards one another. We construct the model-implied measure of international power—asymmetric bilateral import dependence, weighted inversely by sectoral trade elasticities — across country pairs over the past 20 years. Combining this measure with comprehensive data on bilateral engagement events and a high-frequency measure of bilateral geopolitical relationships, we examine the consequences and strategic causes of international power. We show two main empirical results. First, increases in international power between countries — which raise the credibility of threats of trade disruptions — induce more bilateral engagement and negotiations. Second, worsened geopolitical relationships — in anticipation of future disputes — prompt countries to build up greater international power through adjusting trade activities.</content>

    <title>The Role of Industrial Policy in the Renewable Energy Sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Renewable electricity generation technology costs have fallen dramatically, investment has grown rapidly, and renewables are now a pillar of climate and decarbonization policy. Part of the credit for these trends goes to environmental policy efforts to support renewable energy as a substitute to fossil energy. The recent rise in protectionism, industrial policy, and geopolitical tensions has the potential to either undermine or enhance these environmental policy objectives. In this paper, we provide an overview of renewable energy economics and policy, with a focus on solar and wind power. We outline theoretical rationales for industrial policy and review recent empirical research, paying particular attention to how renewable energy policies have generated spillovers across firms and countries. We close by highlighting how this recent evidence can inform ongoing industrial policy debates.</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Coercion with Faster Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a model in which one firm uses a pricing algorithm that enables faster pricing and multi-period commitment. We characterize a coercive equilibrium in which the algorithmic firm maximizes its profits subject to the incentive compatibility constraint of its rival. By adopting an algorithm that enables faster pricing and (imperfect) commitment, a firm can unilaterally induce substantially higher equilibrium prices even when its rival maximizes short-run profits and cannot collude. The algorithmic firm can earn profits that exceed its share of collusive profits, and coercive equilibrium outcomes can be worse for consumers than collusive outcomes. We use simulations to show how coercion arises rapidly when the algorithmic firm’s rival uses a simple learning process to set prices. Finally, we examine the implications of algorithm technology for platform design.</content>

    <title>Can Author Manipulation of AI Referees be Welfare Improving?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a new moral hazard in delegated decision-making: authors can embed hidden instructions—known as prompt injections—to bias AI referees in academic peer review, thereby hijacking machine recommendations. Because AI reviews are relatively inexpensive compared to manual assessments, referees would otherwise delegate fully, which undermines quality. The paper shows that moderate detection of manipulation can paradoxically improve welfare. With intermediate detection probabilities, only low-quality authors undertake manipulation, and detection becomes informative about quality, inducing referees to mix between manual and AI reviews. This partially separating equilibrium preserves the value of peer review when AI quality is intermediate. When detection is too low, all bad papers are manipulated and the market unravels; when detection is perfect, referees use only AI and acceptance collapses. Thus, some prompt injection must be tolerated to sustain the market: it disciplines referees and generates information. The results caution against zero-tolerance enforcement and highlight how prompt injection can, counterintuitively, play a welfare-enhancing role when AI reviews are easily produced.</content>

    <title>Equilibrium Particulate Exposure</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assemble global, spatially disaggregated panel data on ambient particulates, population, and economic activity, and develop a macroeconomic integrated assessment model of particulate exposure for 30 countries representing 60\% of world population. The data indicate the importance of country level factors in determining particulate exposure. Model results indicate the importance of equilibrium adjustments. For example, uncompensated oil taxes and agricultural burning restrictions may unintentionally raise exposure by shifting labor to dirtier sectors or locations. Model results also showcase the importance of country heterogeneity and fiscal management. Our results suggest that effective particulates policy requires accounting for general equilibrium responses.</content>

    <title>Carbon Taxes and Green Subsidies in a World Economy</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine positive and normative questions that arise with the joint use of carbon taxes and green subsidies in an open economy. Moving from autarky to free trade induces countries to introduce green subsidies and reduce carbon taxes, in order to reduce foreign emissions. In contrast to the “leakage” effect of carbon taxes, green subsidies are associated with “reverse leakage,” as they decrease emissions both at home and abroad, and as a consequence, the availability of green subsidies tends to be good for global welfare. International climate agreements (ICAs) seek to increase carbon taxes, but the effect on green subsidies is more nuanced. An ICA removes green subsidies, even though they exert positive international externalities at the noncooperative equilibrium. If, however, policies can only be changed gradually, an ICA may start by increasing subsidies before decreasing them over time. We also consider the welfare implications of lobbying from the fossil and green energy sectors. In a noncooperative setting, we find that pressures from the fossil lobby tend to reduce welfare, whereas pressures from the green lobby tend to increase welfare. We also find that in the presence of lobbying, an ICA can decrease welfare relative to the noncooperative equilibrium, even if it changes carbon taxes and green subsidies toward their efficient levels.</content>

    <title>"Muddling Through or Tunnelling Through?” UK Monetary and Fiscal Exceptionalism and the Great Inflation</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discussion of the causes of the Great Inflation in the UK during the 1970s has centred around the relative importance of two potential explanations, which we label “bad luck” – the occurrence of unusually large commodity price and supply-side shocks - and “bad policy” reflecting failures in both monetary and prices and incomes policies. By reconsidering the historical and empirical record of inflation from 1950s to the early 1990s we show that the persistence of the Great Inflation in the UK cannot fully be explained by these factors, although these can account for some of the major fluctuations. Instead, underlying inflation and inflation expectations appear to be the result of a sequence of regime shifts. We argue those regime shifts are as much related to fundamental changes in fiscal policy as they are to monetary policy and union reforms. Our empirical evidence suggests that fiscal policy was at the heart of many of the problems in the UK during the Great Inflation. In contrast to most of British history, it was not used to stabilise the public finances. Instead, it was used to keep unemployment down and growth up, to subsidise losers from terms of trade shocks and to secure deals with the unions.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Child with Down Syndrome</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the causal impact of having a child with Down syndrome relative to having one without Down syndrome using event studies around birth and population-wide Swedish administrative data from 1990 to 2019. The incremental effect of having a child with Down syndrome is to increase the likelihood of parental co-habitation and subsequent child-bearing. These effects exist both in an environment with essentially no prenatal testing – where the birth of a child with Down syndrome is random conditional on maternal age – as well as once prenatal screening and testing is more common. In both contexts, total income also increases due to the presence of a generous allowance for families with a child with a disability, but the impact on labor earnings differs. In the “no-testing” environment, having a child with Down syndrome leads to a greater decrease in maternal earnings post-birth relative to having a child without Down syndrome, but this effect reverses sign once testing is available. Our results speak to the impact on families of a child with Down syndrome in a setting where families are largely insured against any additional financial costs.</content>

    <title>Rising Young Worker Despair in the United States</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between the early 1990s and 2015 the relationship between mental despair and age was hump-shaped in the United States: it rose to middle-age, then declined later in life.  That relationship has now changed: mental despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among the young.  However, the relationship between age and mental despair differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for those who are unable to work and the unemployed.  The relation between mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for homemakers, students and the retired.  The change in the age-despair profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers.  Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers. We find broad-based evidence for this finding in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of 1993-2023, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2008-2023, and in surveys by Pew, the Conference Board and Johns Hopkins University.</content>

    <title>What Does Consulting Do?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first systematic and comprehensive empirical study of management and strategy consulting. We unveil the workings of this opaque industry by drawing on universal administrative business-to-business transaction data based on value-added tax links from Belgium (2002-2023). These data permit us to document the nature of consulting engagements, take-up patterns, and the effects on client firms. We document that consulting take-up is concentrated among large, high-labor-productivity firms. For TFP and profitability, we find a U-shaped pattern: both high and low performers hire consultants. New clients spend on average 3% of payroll on consulting, typically in episodic engagements lasting less than one year. Using difference-in-differences designs exploiting these sharp consulting events, we find positive effects on labor productivity of 3.6% over five years, driven by modest employment reductions alongside stable or growing revenue. Average wages rise by 2.7% with no decline in labor’s share of value added, suggesting productivity gains do not come at workers’ expense through rent-shifting. We do observe organizational restructuring with small increases in dismissal rates, and higher services procurement but reduced labor outsourcing. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals larger productivity gains for initially less productive firms, suggesting improvements in allocative efficiency. Our findings broadly align with ex-ante predictions from surveyed academic economists and consulting professionals, validating the productivity-enhancing view of consulting endorsed by most practitioners though only half of academics, while lending less support to a rent-shifting view favored by many economists.</content>

    <title>Understanding Cultural Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Culture’s influence on economic outcomes is no longer controversial among economists even if it remains largely ignored in many areas of economics.  This paper tackles a different question:  why does culture change?  The underlying premise adopted here is that culture changes because incentives change, transforming actions and beliefs. An idiosyncratic review of the literature follows that illustrates how the environment (e.g., the prevalence of pathogens or the suitability of land for pastoralism) and historical experiences (e.g., colonization, war, or migration) can affect relationships of power in society and shape people’s beliefs.  It then examines the role of new information and ideas (i.e., learning) and finally the role of policies in shaping incentives and changing culture.  A second part of the paper reviews work that models the mechanisms of cultural change more explicitly, using quantitative models to examine the interplay between economic incentives and evolving beliefs or preferences and to study the importance of intermediating mechanisms.  Given that one of the most profound cultural and economic transformations of the past 150 years concerns gender roles, this theme recurs throughout.</content>

    <title>Opting Out of Centralized Collective Bargaining: Evidence from Italy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.</content>

    <title>The Time Cost of a Disability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider how a physical disability alters patterns of time use. A disability may raise the time cost of all activities; of some—making them differentially less worth doing; or it may make switching activities more costly. The first yields no predictions about time use, but the latter two possibilities both predict that fewer activities will be undertaken, with more time spent on each. These explanations describe our findings based on non-working ATUS 2008-22 respondents ages 70+, 32 percent of whom self-assess a disability. Data from the Polish Time Use Survey, where disability is medically certified, show similar results; and they demonstrate the same loss of variety over multiple days. Remarkably similar basic results are found using homogenized British, Canadian, French, Spanish, and Italian time-diaries. Overall, a mobility/physical disability leads an otherwise identical person to engage in over 10 percent fewer activities on a typical day. The lost variety represents extra costs equivalent in data from six countries to over twice the average annual income among older individuals in the country.</content>

    <title>Multinational Firms and Cross-Border Mergers: Theory and Evidence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multinational firms play a pivotal role in the global economy, yet economic and finance research has largely examined them in isolation.  Economic theory focuses on trade and multinational activity but gives relatively little attention to cross-border mergers, while finance research emphasizes empirical studies of mergers but rarely integrates broader economic theories. This chapter aims to synthesize these two literatures into a unified framework for understanding multinational firms and cross-border mergers.  The discussion is organized around the decision-making process of multinational firms, from choosing to operate internationally to selecting between greenfield investment and mergers.  This framework reveals the theoretical and empirical evidence on the drivers of multinational production,  including productivity gains, knowledge transfers, and market frictions. The findings highlight the commonality between the two literatures, but also suggests that greater integration between economic theory and finance research will generate a deeper understanding of the role of multinational firms in the global economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of the Digital Economy has the potential to reshape international financial markets and the role of traditional reserve assets such as the US dollar. While the creation of Stablecoins may increase the demand for safe dollar-denominated instruments due to reserve backing requirements, they may also serve as substitutes, reducing the global demand for traditional reserve assets. We develop a multicountry model featuring the US, the rest of the world, and a distinct Digital Economy to quantify the impact of the potential expansion of the digital economy. Our results show that, in the long run, the reserve demand effect dominates the substitution effect, leading to lower US interest rates and greater US foreign borrowing. We also find that the expansion of the Digital Economy increases idiosyncratic consumption volatility in the US, while reducing it in the rest of the world.</content>

    <title>Flexible Data Centers and the Grid: Lower Costs, Higher Emissions?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Data centers are among the fastest-growing electricity consumers, raising concerns about their impact on grid operations and decarbonization goals. Their temporal flexibility—the ability to shift workloads over time—offers a source of demand-side flexibility. We model power systems in three U.S. regions: Mid-Atlantic, Texas, and WECC, under varying flexibility levels. We evaluate flexibility's effects on grid operations, investment, system costs, and emissions. Across all scenarios, flexible data centers reduce costs by shifting load from peak to off-peak hours, flattening net demand, and supporting renewable and baseload resources. This load shifting facilitates renewable integration while improving the utilization of existing baseload capacity. As a result, the emissions impact depends on which effect dominates. Higher renewable penetration increases the emissions-reduction potential of data center flexibility, while lower shares favor baseload generation and may raise emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning data center flexibility with renewable deployment and regional conditions.</content>

    <title>Unpacking Aggregate Welfare in a Spatial Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do regional productivity shocks or transportation infrastructure improvements affect aggregate welfare? In a general class of spatial equilibrium models, we provide a formula for aggregate welfare changes, decomposed into terms associated with (i) technology (Fogel 1964, Hulten 1978), (ii) spatial dispersion of marginal utility, (iii) fiscal externalities, (iv) technological externalities, and (v) redistribution. We further use this decomposition to derive a general formula for optimal spatial transfers and show that, whenever optimal transfers are in place, the technology term alone captures the aggregate welfare effects of technological shocks. We apply our framework to study welfare gains from improving the US highway network. We find that changes in the spatial dispersion of marginal utility are as important as technological externalities in accounting for the deviations from the Fogel-Hulten benchmark to assess welfare gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A central challenge in the climate crisis is how to mobilize collective action—and who can do it. We show that digital platforms can transform latent support for sustainability into measurable environmental outcomes, while also generating value for the platform itself. We study Ant Forest, a program embedded in Alipay, China’s leading fintech app, which rewards users’ low-carbon behaviors with game points redeemable for planting real trees in arid regions of the country. Since its launch in 2016, the program has engaged over 700 million users and funded the planting of 500 million trees. Using user-level data, we find that participation is significantly higher in cities that have experienced faster vegetation growth. We propose a “green experience” mechanism: visible environmental improvement fosters greater appreciation for nature and increases support for sustainability efforts elsewhere. Survey evidence supports this mechanism, with participants also citing gamification and warm glow as key motivators. We further document spillover effects: Ant Forest participation boosts donations to external environmental projects and increases overall use of the Alipay app. These findings highlight the potential of digital platforms to scale climate action while creating shared environmental and economic value.</content>

    <title>The Risk, Reward, and Asset Allocation of Nonprofit Endowment Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using tax filings from 374,351 U.S. nonprofit organizations from 2008 to 2020, we provide the first large-scale analysis of endowment prevalence, function, asset allocation, and returns. Endowment use varies systematically across sectors and revenue models. Organizations with endowments scale mission-related spending more effectively and hedge revenue risk through asset allocation. Yet most endowments underperform passive benchmarks, with the weakest performance concentrated among smaller, self-managed funds. Advisory fees are positively correlated with gross returns but negatively with net returns, suggesting overpayment for investment services. Stronger governance, lower discretionary spending, and the use of outsourced CIOs are associated with better performance.</content>

    <title>Rural-Urban Migration and Market Integration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine a new collection of microdata from China with a natural policy experiment to investigate the extent to which reductions in rural-urban migration barriers affect flows of trade and investments between cities and the countryside. We find that increases in worker eligibility for urban residence registration (Hukou) across origin-destination pairs increase rural-urban exports, imports, capital inflows and outflows, both in terms of bilateral transaction values and the number of unique buyer-seller matches. To quantify the implications at the regional level, we interpret these estimates through the lens of a spatial equilibrium model in which migrants can reduce buyer-seller matching frictions. We find that a 10% increase in a rural county's migration market access on average leads to a 1.5% increase in the county's trade market access and a 2% increase in investment market access. In the context of China's recent Hukou reforms, we find that these knock-on effects on market integration were on average larger among the urban destinations compared to the rural origins, reinforcing incentives for rural-urban migration.</content>

    <title>The Undoing of Economic Sanctions: Evidence from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of Ukraine’s economic blockade of the anthracite-rich Donbas region, to demonstrate how trade sanctions’ efficacy can be undermined by trade through non-participatory nations. We document that after the blockade was imposed in March 2017, Russia reported a sharp increase in anthracite imports from Ukraine, while Ukraine reported no exports to Russia at all. We interpret this gap in “mirror statistics” as reflecting a shift in Donbas trade through Russia. Concurrently, Ukraine anthracite imports from Russia increased sharply (from near-zero), indicating that some of the increased supply of anthracite in Russia was exported back to Ukraine. We provide suggestive evidence that Russian traders benefited from monopsony rents, buying low-priced anthracite from Donbas while Russia sold anthracite to Ukraine at prices comparable to other export markets. Overall, our findings highlight some of the economic and geographic features that may raise the cost and limit the efficacy of sanctions.</content>

    <title>The Personalist Penalty: Varieties of Autocracy and Economic Growth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies of income and regime type typically contrast democracies and autocracies, ignoring heterogeneity in the character of authoritarian regimes. We focus on the consequences of personalist rule, where power is concentrated in an individual or small elite. Extending the dynamic panel strategy of Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2019), we estimate the differential growth performance of democracies, institutionalized autocracies, and personalist autocracies. Across eight GDP series, eight autocracy codings, and six measures of personalism, we observe a consistent pattern: Whenever an "autocratic penalty" emerges, it is concentrated in personalist regimes. The growth performance of institutionalized dictatorships, in contrast, is statistically indistinguishable from that of democracies. We document evidence that the "personalist penalty" is driven by some combination of low private investment, poor public-goods provision, and conflict. These findings emphasize the analytic payoff of unpacking autocracy and highlight the different incentives facing leaders with narrow and broad bases of power.</content>

    <title>Attitudes to Debt: The Role of Moral Values</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper tests how people’s moral values influence their views of debt contracts. We ask participants to make decisions about debt contracts in different hypothetical situations (vignettes). We separately measure their moral values using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham et al., 2009). We have three main sets of findings. First, differences in moral values strongly explain the cross-section of participants’ debt decisions. Participants with more conservative values show more support for credit score-based loan pricing, stricter forms of collateral, and tougher bankruptcy resolution. Second, when we randomly change the economic costs and benefits of debt within our vignettes, we find that participants change their answers in the direction predicted by economic theory. Third, participants’ beliefs of the functioning of the credit market strongly correlate with their moral values. Participants with conservative values are more likely to believe that strict enforcement and risk-based loan pricing provide incentives and are economically efficient. More liberal participants believe that insurance against unlucky shocks are important. Consistent with moral values being distinct from Bayesian beliefs, financial literacy does not attenuate moral values in shaping beliefs about what is economically efficient.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a model of education production and uses it to study optimal school system and curriculum design. Curriculum design is modeled as a time-allocation problem. A school teaches students many skills and allocates time to different skills based on student characteristics.  Our framework provides a novel interpretation of studies that find zero achievement effects at selective school admission cutoffs. We show that such findings may be consistent with highly effective schools implementing optimal curricula, rather than necessarily indicating ineffective schools. The interpretation depends on the alignment between measured outcome skills and skills emphasized in the curriculum. We test several model predictions using data from a prominent exam school and find supporting evidence that would be difficult to rationalize if selective schools were ineffective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic models of legislative bargaining predict that proposers can extract high shares of economic surplus by identifying and exploiting weak coalition partners. However, strength and weakness can be difficult to assess even with relatively simple bargaining protocols. We evaluate experimentally how strategic complexity affects the ability to identify weak coalition partners, and for the partners themselves to determine whether their positions are weak or strong. We find that, as strategic complexity progressively obscures bargaining strength, proposers migrate to egalitarianism, in significant part because non-proposers begin placing substantial weight on fairness. Greater analytic skill dampens but does not eliminate these patterns.</content>

    <title>New Economic Forces Behind the Value Distribution of Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in a general-purpose technology (GPT) enable many firms to invent complementary inventions, or co-inventions, making the GPT more valuable. This study examines the empirical implications of a straightforward model in which firms choose either incremental or novel co-invention.  Incremental co-inventors aspire to small gains at low costs and with less uncertainty. Novel co-inventors introduce new products or services with the potential for large returns, but do so at high costs and with uncertain outcomes. Similar firms investing in incremental co-invention will create value proportional to their existing business, a benchmark we illustrate with the experiences at local radio and newspapers. The study then examines the value of co-inventions for the World Wide Web and mobile ecosystems, focusing on success in 2013, using data from many sources. This data supports analysis comparing the incremental and novel regimes. The latter should display a distinctly different upper tail of the distribution of returns. We show that the value distributions for incremental and novel co-invention are far apart.  Incremental co-invention is more widely distributed across regions, industries, and firms. Success from novel co-invention is rare, challenging, and the source of the largest value. In the aggregate, novel co-invention creates the most value, so the overall value distribution remains concentrated in a few industries, regions, and firms.</content>

    <title>An Informational Nudge to Shave Peak Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Informational nudges to encourage energy conservation or load shifting have been tried in various contexts. This paper studies a program run by a small municipally owned electric utility to reduce demand on certain peak demand days. An email alert is sent out to residential customers who sign up for the alerts. Some recipients of those alerts forward the alerts to other customers or community groups, making it difficult to determine how broadly the alerts are disseminated. The alerts encourage load shifting and energy saving during specific hours on the following day.
Using hourly load data for the utility, I estimate the reduction in electricity load caused by the alert emails. Using an instrumental variables approach, estimates suggest that load is reduced by roughly 0.7 MWs per hour during the hours covered by the alert. This works out to a reduction in load on the order of 2 percent. I calculate the cost savings to the municipal utility and discuss social and private benefits of the program. The private benefits of the peak alert program swamp the social benefits.</content>

    <title>The Causal Effect of News on Inflation Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the response of household inflation expectations to television news coverage of inflation.  We analyze news data from CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC alongside a daily measure of inflation expectations. Using a local projection instrumental variables approach, we estimate the dynamic causal effect of inflation news coverage on household inflation expectations at a daily frequency. Increased media coverage of inflation raises expectations, with effects peaking within a few days and fading after approximately 10 days. Additionally, we document a key nonlinearity: release days with positive CPI surprises—i.e., inflation exceeding market expectations—lead to stronger expectation responses than release days with negative surprises.</content>

    <title>Campaigning for Extinction: Eradication of Sparrows and the Great Famine in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do large disruptions to ecosystems affect human well-being? This paper tests the long-standing hypothesis that China's 1958 Four Pests Campaign, which exterminated sparrows despite scientists’ warnings about their pest-control role, exacerbated the Great Famine—the largest in human history. Combining newly digitized data on historical agricultural productivity in China with habitat suitability modeling methods in ecology, we find that, after sparrow eradication, a one-standard-deviation increase in sparrow suitability led to 5.3% larger rice and 8.7% larger wheat declines. State food procurement exacerbated these losses, resulting in a 9.6% higher mortality in high-suitability counties—implying nearly two million excess deaths.</content>

    <title>Retail Investors’ Contrarian Behavior Around News, Attention, and the Momentum Effect</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large and representative panel of U.S. brokerage accounts, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and that such contrarian trading contributes to price momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD).  We show that extreme return streaks and surprises are not enough for stocks to exhibit PEAD and momentum and that the intensity of contrarian retail trading plays a key role: the PEAD of loser stocks with bad earnings surprises becomes increasingly more negative as retail buying pressure increases, and he PEAD of the stocks with the highest past returns and largest earnings surprises is the most positive for the stocks with the biggest net retail outflow. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. Younger and more attentive individuals are more likely to be contrarian, and a firm’s dividend yield, leverage, size, book to market, and analyst coverage are associated with the fraction of contrarian trades they face around earnings announcements.  The disposition effect and stale limit orders, while present in our sample, do not explain our results. Our findings are consistent with investors’ conservatism, sticky beliefs, and cognitive uncertainty, as well as an incorrect belief in the Law of Small Numbers.</content>

    <title>Entrepreneurial Experimentation Design for Venture Finance</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how entrepreneurs strategically design experiments to convince venture capitalists (VCs) to fund their projects when investors interpret data through heterogeneous statistical frameworks. Drawing on Liang (2021)'s model of games with incomplete information played by statistical learners, we translate her abstract theoretical framework into a practical venture capital setting. We characterise how entrepreneurs balance funding plausibility against equity dilution by strategically choosing experiments along two critical dimensions: sample size (precision) and dimensionality (breadth of metrics). Our analysis reveals that for genuinely high-quality projects, increased precision helps by forcing VC beliefs to converge toward true quality. For low-quality projects, funding depends on preserving disagreement through sparse, high-dimensional experiments. The entrepreneur's optimal design depends critically on their prior beliefs: confident entrepreneurs choose high-precision, low-dimensional experiments that minimise equity dilution, while uncertain entrepreneurs opt for sparse, high-dimensional experiments that maximise the probability some VC will hold sufficiently optimistic beliefs. The framework provides a rigorous foundation for understanding how entrepreneurs and investors can rationally disagree when observing identical evidence, with significant implications for strategic information design in entrepreneurial settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop novel high-frequency indices that measure climate attention across a wide range of developed and emerging economies. By analyzing the text of over 23 million Tweets published by leading national newspapers, we find that a country experiencing more severe climate news shocks tends to see both an inflow of capital and an appreciation of its currency. In addition, brown stocks experience large and persistent negative returns after a global climate news shock if located in highly exposed countries. A risk-sharing model in which investors price climate news shocks and trade consumption and investment goods in global markets rationalizes these findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How beneficial are transport infrastructure investments and other transport policies? This chapter develops a framework whose goal is to survey and synthesize the answers that regional and urban economists have given to this question. Emphasis is placed on theoretical results about sufficient statistics that capture approximate impacts in both distorted and undistorted economies, as well as how new advances in data collection and causal inference are poised to leverage these theoretical results and thereby modernize and extend standard templates for infrastructure and policy evaluation. The chapter concludes with discussions of optimal policy, political economy, and practical matters of infrastructure provision.</content>

    <title>Feeling Rich or Looking Rich? Quantifying Self-Image and Social-Image Motives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Preferences for status are typically attributed to two distinct channels: self-image, in which individuals derive utility from being richer than others, and social-image, in which individuals value being seen as richer by others. While both channels are believed to be at play, little is known about their relative importance. We address this gap using a hypothetical discrete choice experiment. Our findings indicate that self-image is at most 19.3% as important as social-image. Additionally, we document substantial heterogeneity in the strength of these preferences across individuals and domains.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that effective reskilling can have profound mental health benefits for workers and their partners. Using institutional variation in access to higher education after work accidents in Denmark, we find that reskilling prevents one case of depression for every three injured workers. Strikingly, the spillover effects on partners are just as large. These mental health gains are accompanied by higher partner employment and increased separation rates, suggesting that reskilling frees partners from costly relationship commitments. Together, the mental health and partner benefits add 83% to the direct labor earnings gains from reskilling.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Global Supply Chains: An Integrated Framework That Incorporates Foreign Invested Firms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new unified accounting framework to measure Global Supply Chain (GSC) activities. It integrates decomposition frameworks on gross output, trade, and value added, and formally incorporates the role of Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs). Compared to the existing Global Value Chain (GVC) metrics that do not distinguish FIEs from domestic firms, the estimate of GSC activities in our approach is three times as large. The key contributions of our approach are: (1) distinguishing GSC activities based on their positions along production chains (upstream, downstream, or both) and mode of engagement (trade, FDI, or both); (2) extending Vertical Specialization (VS) measures to domestic supply chains, bridging trade-only and production-based analyses; and (3) reconciling net and gross decompositions to provide a comprehensive view of GSC participation and exposures.</content>

    <title>The Social Lifecycle Impacts of Power Plant Siting in the Historical United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relative contributions of siting decisions and post-siting demo-graphic shifts to current disparities in exposure to polluting fossil-fuel plants in the United States. Our analysis leverages newly digitized data on power plant siting and operations from 1900-2020, combined with spatially resolved demographics and population data from the U.S Census from 1870-2020. We find little evidence that fossil-fuel plants were disproportionately sited in counties with higher Black population shares on average. However, event study estimates indicate that Black population share grows in the decades after the first fossil-fuel plant is built in a county, with average increases in Black population share of 4 percentage points in the 50-70 years after first siting. These long-run demographic shifts are driven by counties that first hosted a fossil-fuel plant between 1900-1949. We close by exploring how these long-run demographic shifts were shaped by the Great Migration, differential sorting in response to pollution, and other factors. Our findings highlight that the equity implications of siting long-lived infrastructure can differ dramatically depending on the time span considered.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I describe nine implications of the interconnectedness of fiscal and monetary policy that surface in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models. Not all are unique to HANK models. (i) Long run fiscal changes force monetary adjustments. (ii) Sustainable permanent deficits are feasible. (iii) Monetary policy leaves fiscal footprints, even with passive fiscal policy. (iv) Fewer controversies around active fiscal policy. (v) Equilibria are unique under a wider class of fiscal and monetary rules. (vi) With short-term debt, raising nominal rates without a fiscal contraction raises inflation. (vii) Unfunded fiscal stimulus is more inflationary. (viii) Even fully funded fiscal stimulus is inflationary. (ix) Fiscal transfers can substitute for monetary policy in the aggregate.</content>

    <title>Misperceptions About Air Pollution: Implications for Willingness to Pay and Environmental Inequality</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether misperceptions about air pollution contribute to environmental inequality in the United States. We use a two-part survey experiment to elicit respondents' beliefs about local air quality and pollution's effects on life expectancy. We document how misperception differs across demographic groups and then how this misperception affects willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. Since misperception or beliefs may be correlated with other unobservable determinants of WTP, we randomly show selected participants customized information about their actual air pollution. This allows us to trace out how experimentally induced changes in beliefs affect WTP for air quality. Our results suggest significant misperceptions about air pollution in the US. Respondents, on average, overestimate both their air pollution exposure and its impact on life expectancy. Beliefs about relative air pollution are not systematically biased but are noisy. Despite some differences in misperceptions between Black and White respondents, counterfactual exercises do not suggest that rectifying these misperceptions would meaningfully close the observed gap in WTP and/or pollution exposure.</content>

    <title>Fear and Risk Perception: Understanding Physicians' Dynamic Responses to Malpractice Lawsuits</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how physicians adjust their clinical decision-making following medical malpractice lawsuits and how these responses are driven by mental rather than ﬁnancial costs, and do not align with rational expectations. We combine a comprehensive health insurance claim database from a Chinese city with the universe of malpractice lawsuits to study changes in physician behavior and patient outcomes. We ﬁnd that physicians respond to lawsuits by practicing more conservatively, rejecting high-risk patients, reducing surgery rates, and increasing the use of diagnostic tests and traditional Chinese medicine. These changes are associated with worse patient outcomes, consistent with defensive medicine. The eﬀects are not limited to the directly involved departments but spill over to other departments within the same hospital. In addition, the changes are short-lived, with physicians reverting to their pre-lawsuit treatment patterns in eight weeks. We provide evidence that such responses are likely driven by mental cost (including fear) and deviate from rational expectations. First, physicians in hospitals with more and less frequent lawsuits exhibit similar responses to a new lawsuit; moreover, they respond similarly to winning and losing cases. Second, physicians’ reactions to a patient’s death vary depending on the recency of a salient lawsuit. Lastly, physician responses are especially strong following criminal violence against physicians, which is emotionally and psychologically salient.</content>

    <title>Concentration and Markups in International Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper derives a closed-form expression linking aggregate markups on imported inputs to concentration in a model of firm-to-firm trade with two-sided market power. Our theory extends standard oligopoly insights in two dimensions. First, it reveals that markups increase with exporter concentration and decrease with importer concentration, reflecting the balance of oligopoly and oligopsony forces. Second, it adapts conventional market definitions to reflect rigid trading relationships, yielding new concentration measures that capture competition in firm-to-firm trade. Analysis of Colombian transaction-level import data shows these differences are key to understanding markup dynamics in international trade.</content>

    <title>Random Walk Forecasts of Stationary Processes Have Low Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the use of a misspecified overdifferenced model to forecast the level of a stationary scalar time series. Let x(t) be the series, and let bias be the sample average of a series of forecast errors. Then, the bias of forecasts of x(t) generated by a misspecified overdifferenced ARMA model for Δx(t) will tend to be smaller in magnitude than the bias of forecasts of x(t) generated by a correctly specified model for x(t). Formally, let P be the number of forecasts. The bias from the model for Δx(t) has a variance that is O(1/P^2), while the variance of the bias from the model for x(t) generally is O(1/P). With a driftless random walk as our baseline overdifferenced model, we confirm this theoretical result with simulations and empirical work: random walk bias is generally one-tenth to one-half that of an appropriately specified model fit to levels.</content>

    <title>Market Rents and CPI Shelter Inflation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research finds that the shelter component of CPI inflation responds with a lag to movements in market rents—the rents that tenants pay when they move into a new dwelling. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of this fact. We start by identifying three sources of lags between market rents and CPI shelter: the rents of most tenants are set in long-term leases; rents are smoothed for continuing tenants who renew leases; and CPI shelter inflation is measured with rent changes over six months. We incorporate these lags in a model of shelter inflation and compare the model to monthly data since 2015, using the Zillow Observed Rent Index to measure market rents. We find that the model performs fairly well, suggesting that it may be useful for understanding and forecasting inflation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The central appeal of environmental markets – efficient allocation of emission reductions – has been difficult to establish empirically. We develop a framework linking the theoretical change in allocative efficiency following a market-based policy to a quasi-experimental estimator. We apply this framework with administrative data to two major U.S. air pollution markets. We find allocative efficiency for pollution improved by 3.3 percentage points annually under California’s RECLAIM program but do not detect a change under the U.S.’ NOx Budget Trading Program. These results are supported by greater heterogeneity in baseline facility characteristics under RECLAIM and differences in program implementation.</content>

    <title>Markups and Cost Pass-through Along the Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a novel dataset of production costs, wholesale prices, and retail prices from a large global manufacturer to study markups and pricing behavior along the supply chain. We document several facts about markups covering the period July 2018 through June 2023, and we propose a model of supply chain pricing behavior that rationalizes key pat-terns in our data. We find substantial dispersion in markups across products at each supply chain level. Manufacturer and retail markups are negatively correlated in the cross section and over time. Despite time-series variation in firm-level markups, total markups—reflecting the relationship between retail prices and production costs—are stable over time, even when prices increased along with inflation in the United States in 2022. We apply our model to quantify factors that determine relative bargaining power between the manufacturer and retailers, leveraging variation across countries, products, and time. Finally, we consider the dynamics of cost pass-through and the mediating role of manufacturer-retailer bargaining in price dynamics, with implications for current policy debates, including trade policy and tariffs.</content>

    <title>Optimal Tariffs with Geopolitical Alignment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As geopolitical tensions intensify, great powers often turn to trade policy to influence international alignment. We examine the optimal design of tariffs in a world where large countries care not only about economic welfare but also about the political allegiance of smaller states. We consider both a unipolar setting, where a single hegemon uses preferential trade agreements to attract partners, and a bipolar world, where two great powers compete for influence. In both scenarios, we derive optimal tariffs that balance terms-of-trade considerations with strategic incentives to encourage political alignment. We find that when geopolitical concerns are active, the optimal tariff exceeds the classic Mill-Bickerdike level. In a bipolar world, optimal tariffs reflect both economic and political rivalry, and may be strategic complements or substitutes. A calibration exercise using U.N. voting patterns, an estimate of the cost of buying votes in the U.N., and military spending suggests that geopolitical motives can significantly amplify protectionist pressures and that the emergence of a second great power can contribute to a retreat from globalization.</content>

    <title>The Legacy of High Inflation on Monetary Policy Rules</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows the key, yet overlooked, role played by the legacy of a high inflation history on the strength of the monetary policy response to inflationary shocks. To rationalize this, we propose a New Keynesian model that diverges from the existing workhorse model by adding path-dependence (to a forward-looking model) and potentially imperfect central bank credibility. We show that achieving low inflation (hitting the target) requires more aggressive monetary policy reactions, and is costlier from an output point of view, when individuals’ past inflationary experiences shape their inflation expectation formation. In turn, we provide empirical evidence of the need for these two theoretical additions. Countries that experienced a high level of inflation before adopting the IT regime tend to respond more aggressively to deviations of inflation expectations from the central bank’s target. We also point to the existence of a credibility puzzle, whereby the strength of a central bank’s monetary policy response to deviations from the inflation target remains broadly unchanged even as central banks gain credibility over time. Put differently, a country’s inflationary past casts a long and persistent shadow on central banks.</content>

    <title>Are Juries Racially Discriminatory? Evidence from the Race-Blind Charging of Grand Jury Defendants with and without Racially Distinctive Names</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We implement five different tests of whether grand juries, which are drawn from a representative cross-section of the public, discriminate against Black defendants when deciding to prosecute felony cases. Three tests exploit that while jurors do not directly observe defendant race, jurors do observe the “Blackness” of defendants’ names. All three tests—an audit-study-style test, a traditional outcome-based test, and a test that estimates racial bias using blinded/unblinded comparisons after purging omitted variable bias—indicate juries do not discriminate based on race. Two additional tests indicate racial bias explains at most 0.3 percent of the Black-White felony conviction gap.</content>

    <title>Sequential College Admission Mechanisms and Off-Platform Options</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The optimal functioning of centralized allocation systems is undermined by the presence of institutions operating off-platform—a feature common to virtually all real-world implementations. These off-platform options generate justified envy, as students may reject their centralized assignment in favor of an outside offer, leaving vacant seats in programs that others would have preferred to their current match. We examine whether sequential assignment procedures can mitigate this inefficiency: they allow students to delay their enrollment decision to potentially receive a better offer later, at the cost of waiting before knowing their final admission outcome. To quantify this trade-off, we estimate a dynamic model of application and acceptance decisions using rich administrative data from the French college admission system, which include rank-ordered lists and waiting decisions. We find that waiting costs are large. Yet, by improving students’ assignment outcomes relative to a standard single-round system, the sequential mechanism decreases the share of students who leave the higher education system without a degree by 5.4% and leads to large welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Seemingly Virtuous Complexity in Return Prediction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Return prediction with Random Fourier Features (RFF)—a very large number, P , of nonlinear trans-formations of a small number, K, of predictor variables—has become popular recently. Surprisingly, this approach appears to yield a successful out-of-sample stock market index timing strategy even when trained in rolling windows as small as T = 12 months with P in the thousands. However, when P ≫ T , the RFF-based forecast becomes a weighted average of the T training sample returns, with weights determined by the similarity between the predictor vectors in the training data and the current predictor vector. In short training windows, similarity primarily reflects temporal proximity, so the forecast reduces to a recency-weighted average of the T return observations in the training data—essentially a momentum strategy. Moreover, because similarity declines with predictor volatility, the result is a volatility-timed momentum strategy. The strong performance of the RFF-based strategy thus stems not from its ability to extract predictive signals from the training data, but from the fact that a volatility-timed momentum strategy happened to perform well in historical data. This point becomes clear when applying the same method to artificial data in which returns exhibit reversals rather than momentum: the RFF approach still constructs the same volatility-timed momentum strategy, which then performs poorly.</content>

    <title>Turning Points in Inflation: A Structural Breaks Approach with Micro Data</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Alberto Cavallo &amp; Gaston Garcia Zavaleta</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel methodology for detecting inflation turning points that com-bines high-frequency, disaggregated price data with standard structural break techniques to provide policymakers with more timely and precise signals of inflation dynamics. The methodology consists of three key components: measuring inflation as the slope of the log price index rather than using conventional inflation rates, employing structural break techniques to detect shifts in this slope, and leveraging highly disaggregated price indexes to identify trend breaks at a granular level. We apply this approach to study two critical recent episodes: Argentina’s 2024–2025 disinflation and the inflationary impact of U.S. tariff adjustments in 2025. For Argentina, we detect a broad-based disinflationary turning point in May 2024. For the U.S., we find evidence of a turning point in February 2025, with significant sectoral inflation accelerations despite stable aggregate inflation measures. These applications demonstrate the utility of our approach for enhancing real-time inflation monitoring and policy decision-making.</content>

    <title>Why Did Air Conditioning Adoption Accelerate Faster Than Predicted? Evidence from Mexico</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common theme in the vast literature on climate change is the estimation of models using historical data to make predictions many decades into the future. Although there is a large and growing number of these types of studies, researchers rarely return later to check the accuracy of their predictions. In this paper, we perform such an exercise. In Davis and Gertler (2015), we used household-level microdata from Mexico to predict future air conditioning adoption as a function of income and temperature. Revisiting these predictions with 12 years of additional data, we find that air conditioning in Mexico has accelerated, significantly exceeding our predictions. Neither errors in predicting income growth or rising temperatures, nor migration patterns, nor an overly restrictive model can explain the large prediction gap. Instead, our results point to the failure to account for falling electricity prices and technological changes in air conditioner eﬀiciency as key drivers of the prediction gap.</content>

    <title>GenAI Misinformation, Trust, and News Consumption: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how AI-generated misinformation affects demand for trustworthy news, using data from a field experiment by a major German outlet, Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ). Readers were randomly assigned to a treatment highlighting the challenge of distinguishing real from AI-generated images. The treatment raised concern with misinformation (0.3 s.d.) and reduced trust in news (0.1 s.d.), including SZ. Importantly, it affected post-survey browsing behavior: daily visits to SZ digital content rose by 2.5% in the immediate aftermath of the treatment. Moreover, we find that subscriber retention increased by 1.1% after five months, corresponding to about a one-third drop in attrition rate. Results are consistent with a model where the relative value of trustworthy news sources increases with the prevalence of misinformation, which may thus boost engagement with those sources even while lowering trust in news content.</content>

    <title>When is Less More? Bank Arrangements for Liquidity vs Central Bank Support</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory suggests that in the face of fire sale externalities, banks have incentives to overinvest in order to issue excessive money-like deposit liabilities. The existence of a private market for insurance such as contingent capital can eliminate the overinvestment incentives, leading to efficient outcomes. However, it does not eliminate fire sales. A central bank that can infuse liquidity cheaply may be motivated to intervene in the face of fire sales. If so, it can crowd out the private market and, if liquidity intervention is not priced at higher-than-breakeven rates, induce overinvestment. We examine various forms of public intervention to identify the least distortionary ones. Our analysis helps understand the historical prevalence of private insurance in the era preceding central banks and deposit insurance, their subsequent disappearance, as well as the continuing incidence of banking crises and speculative excesses.</content>

    <title>Can Cash Transfers Save Lives? Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment in Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the impacts of large-scale unconditional cash transfers on child survival. One-time transfers of USD 1000 were provided to over 10,500 poor households across 653 randomized villages in Kenya. We collected census data on over 100,000 births, including on mortality and cause of death, and detailed data on household health behaviors. Unconditional cash transfers (accounting for spillovers) lead to 48% fewer infant deaths before age one and 45% fewer child deaths before age five. Detailed data on cause of death, transfer timing relative to birth, and the location of health facilities indicate that unconditional cash transfers and access to delivery care are complements in generating mortality reductions: the largest gains are estimated in neonatal and maternal causes of death largely preventable by appropriate obstetric care and among households living close to physician-staffed facilities and those who receive the transfer around the time of birth, and treatment leads to a large increase in hospital deliveries (by 45%). The infant and child mortality declines are concentrated among poorer households with below median assets or predicted consumption. The transfers also result in a substantial decline of 51% in female labor supply in the three months before and the three months after a birth, and improved child nutrition. Infant and child mortality largely revert to pre-program levels after cash transfers end. Despite not being the main aim of the original program, we show that unconditional cash transfers in this setting may be a cost-effective way to reduce infant and child deaths.</content>

    <title>Information Frictions and the Labor Market for Public School Teachers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information frictions—where a worker and her current employer know more about the worker’s productivity than prospective employers—have complex equity-efficiency implications in the teacher labor market. Reducing information frictions may make it easier for effective teachers to move to their preferred schools and increase cross-school inequality, but it may also attract high-quality entrants and improve market-level teacher quality. Taking these factors into account, we develop an equilibrium model of the teacher labor market and estimate it using data from the Houston Independent School District, which launched a transparent teacher evaluation system in 2011. Counterfactual simulations reveal that (1) making district teachers’ quality observable to all district schools improves average teacher quality at the district level and in the top and bottom quartiles of schools ranked by student performance, while decreasing it in other schools; (2) budget-neutral bonus programs that incentivize high-quality teachers to teach in low-performing schools can increase overall teacher quality and reduce cross-school inequalities; and (3) these programs are more effective in markets with cross-employer information symmetry.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study deforestation in a dynamic world trade system. We first document that between 1990-2020: (i) global forest area has decreased by 7.1 percent, with large heterogeneity across countries, (ii) deforestation is associated with expansions of agricultural land use, (iii) deforestation is larger in countries with a comparative advantage in agriculture, and (iv) population growth causes deforestation. Motivated by these facts, we build a model in which structural change and comparative advantage determine the extent, location, and timing of deforestation. Using the model, we obtain conditions under which reductions in trade costs and tariffs reduce global deforestation. Quantitatively, eliminating global agricultural tariffs has limited impacts on global forest area, leads to substantial forest reallocation across countries, and results in net welfare benefits</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study voting in general elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Our data set includes demographics and turnout of all registered voters for the years 2016–2020, as well as vote shares at the precinct and contest level. We estimate a Downsian voting model incorporating rich observed and unobserved heterogeneity at the voter and contest level. We find that voters with high perceived voting costs tend to favor Democrats, as do marginal voters in most districts. Variation in state voting policies accounts for a modest share of overall estimated voting costs but is sufficient to determine the majority party in some years. We also find that many states’ district maps favor one party in converting votes to seats. On net, these biases favor Republicans. For example, we estimate that winning 50% of votes in every state would give Republicans a nine percentage point seat advantage in the House.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Borrowers’ use of cashless payments improves their access to capital from FinTech lenders and predicts a lower probability of default. These relationships are stronger for cashless technologies providing more precise information, and for outflows. Cashless payment usage complements other signals of borrower quality. We rationalize these empirical findings using a framework in which borrowers signal their lower likelihood of diverting cash flows through payment technology choice, and screening accuracy is further strengthened by informational complementarities. The informational synergy we uncover provides a rationale for the joint rise of cashless payments and FinTech lending, as well as for open banking.</content>

    <title>Has the Rise of Work from Home Reduced the Motherhood Penalty in the Labor Market?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When women become mothers, they often take a step back from their careers.  Could work from home (WFH) reduce this motherhood penalty, particularly in traditionally family-unfriendly careers? We leverage technological changes prior to the pandemic that increased the feasibility of WFH in some college degrees but not others. In degrees where WFH increased, motherhood gaps in employment narrowed: for every 10% increase in WFH, mothers’ employment rates increased by 0.78 per centage points (or 0.94%) relative to other women’s. This change is driven by majors linked to careers that have high returns to hours and inflexible demands on workers’ time. We microfound these results using panel data that show that women who could WFH before childbirth are less likely to exit the workforce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intermediary asset pricing posits that financial institutions are important players in financial markets, and that their decisions shape asset prices beyond simply reflecting the preferences of the average household in the economy. We explain how the intermediary-asset pricing approach helps make sense of empirical patterns in the data: the excess volatility of asset prices, differences in price movements across asset classes, the cross section of expected returns within asset classes, and specific arbitrages and price dislocations. We also review how this view of price fluctuations has important implications for macroeconomic dynamics, international economics, and policy. In particular, the role of financial regulation and monetary policy in alleviating constraints or removing risk from intermediary balance sheets during periods of stress is central in this approach. We highlight both existing progress and gaps for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a unified model of the cognitive division of labour in a knowledge economy.  Building on recent frameworks for knowledge creation and decision making under uncertainty, it distinguishes between specialists, who engage in costly “on the spot” reasoning to generate tacit knowledge around a focal point, and generalists, who search for and interpolate existing knowledge but deliver answers subject to error.  The model characterises how these two types of workers should be allocated across a continuum of questions, given the location of codified knowledge points and the distribution of problems.  It shows that optimal task assignment depends on the cognitive process through which information is processed rather than on skill endowments or task complexity.  When specialists operate around both knowledge points, their allocation is shaped by their absolute advantage over generalists, leading to non‐contiguous specialist domains interspersed with generalist regions.  When specialists cluster around a single point, a natural boundary emerges between specialist and generalist domains that shifts but persists despite changes in question distribution.  Extending the analysis to a two‐period setting, the paper identifies when specialists should sacrifice static efficiency to codify their tacit discoveries, creating bridges that allow generalists to operate more effectively in the future.  These results provide a formal microfoundation for Babbage’s insights into the division of cognitive labour and offer predictions about how knowledge work responds to changes in the knowledge environment, the distribution of questions, and the patience of capital.</content>

    <title>The Great Gatsby Curve: Upward Mobility, Persistence and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the Great Gatsby curve that connects inequality to mobility, using panel data spanning several countries and time periods. Existing literature observes that the intergenerational elasticity of earnings falls as inequality rises, implying that mobility (viewed as the negative of that elasticity) is negatively correlated with inequality. In sharp contrast, we show that measures of upward mobility, axiomatically aligned with progressivity in income growth rates, are robustly and positively associated with baseline inequality. While there is no contradiction here, our study highlights crucial differences between mobility measures based on (lower) persistence and those based on growth progressivity, and asks the reader to align their choice of measure with foundational criteria that they feel best describe “mobility". Our findings offer a re-interpretation of the Gatsby curve through the lens of shared prosperity, and have implications for the evolution of inequality within countries.</content>

    <title>A Tale of Two Transitions: Mobility Dynamics in China and Russia after Central Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines intergenerational mobility in China and Russia during their transitions from central planning to market systems.  We consider mobility as movement captured by changes in status between parents and children. We provide estimates of overall mobility, which involves mobility during transition to a system's steady state, as well as steady state mobility, which captures long-run mobility independent of transitional dynamics or shifts in the marginal distribution of outcomes across generations. We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries.</content>

    <title>Is This Really Kneaded? Identifying and Eliminating Potentially Harmful Forms of Workplace Control</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a large German bakery chain, many workers report negative perceptions of monitoring via checklists. We survey workers and managers about the value and time costs to all in-store checklists, leading the firm to randomly remove two of the most perceivedly time-consuming and low-value checklists in half of stores. Sales increase and store manager attrition substantially decreases, and  this occurs without a rise in measurable workplace problems. Before random assignment, regional managers predict whether the treatment would be effective for each store they oversee. Ex post, beneficial effects of checklist removal are fully concentrated in stores where regional managers predict the treatment will be effective, reflecting substantial heterogeneity in returns that is well-understood by these upper managers. Effects of checklist removal do not appear to come from workers having more time for production, but rather coincide with improvements in employee trust and commitment. Following the RCT, the firm implemented firmwide reductions in monitoring, eliminating a checklist regarded as demeaning, but keeping a checklist that helps coordinate production.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As Ukraine emerges from the devastation of war, it faces a historic opportunity to engineer its own Wirtschaftswunder—a productivity-driven economic transformation akin to post-war West Germany. While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine’s long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business dynamism and engineer Ukraine’s Wirtschaftswunder. Policies targeting specific types of firms have limited efficacy when incumbents run wild.</content>

    <title>The Breakdown of the English Society of Orders: The Role of the Industrial Revolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of the English Industrial Revolution in promoting social mobility and ending the society of orders: one based on rigid social categories and regulated by inherited characteristics. We combine two new datasets on individual wealth holdings before and after the Industrial Revolution. Our main finding is that noble and gentry titles as well as surnames explain significantly less of the variation in wealth after the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, these declines are substantially larger in the parts of England most impacted by the Revolution. We also explore the extent to which different characteristics predict being rich. We then study a key facet of this increased social mobility - geographical and occupational mobility. We show that people with surnames that were more mobile tended to be in the north and working in manufacturing. Moreover, areas that experienced greater outward mobility were more urbanized; less agrarian; had institutionalized markets; more gentry; were poorer (as proxied by tax revenues); and were more likely to be the residence of a member of parliament.</content>

    <title>Unbalanced Financial Globalization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model of international investment and production to investigate the real implications of the last five decades of financial globalization. We introduce a wedge accounting framework to estimate country- and time-varying measures of outward and inward Revealed Capital Account Openness (RKO). We show how to identify these wedges for a large panel of countries using limited publicly available data on national accounts and external asset and liability positions since the 1970s. Our analysis reveals striking cross-country differences in the pace and direction of financial account opening: wealthier countries have become relatively more open to foreign capital inflows, while poorer countries have become relatively more open to capital outflows, a phenomenon we call “Unbalanced Financial Globalization.” Counterfactual simulations show that this unbalanced financial globalization has worsened capital allocation, resulting in a 5.9% decrease in world GDP, a 3.4% rise in cross-country income inequality, lower wages in poorer countries, and a decline in rates of return on capital in richer countries. In contrast, if financial account opening had been uniform, the improved allocation of capital would have reduced income inequality, and increased global GDP. These findings underscore the crucial role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping the real impact of international capital markets integration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of climate change and mitigation-related employment changes on U.S. politics. We combine 2000-2020 precinct-level voting information and congressional candidate positions on environmental policy with high-resolution temperature, precipitation, and census block-group level measures of “green” and “brown” employment shares. Holding politician positions fixed within a district, we find that Democratic vote shares increase with exogenous changes in local climate and green transition employment. We embed these estimates into a model of political competition, including both direct and demand-driven effects of shocks on candidate supply of climate policy positions. Incorporating these estimates into 2022-2050 projections of climate change and green employment transition, we find that voting for the Democratic Party increases, while both parties move slightly to the right on climate policy. Under worst-case climate projections and current mitigation trajectories, our estimates indicate that the probability the House passes a carbon-pricing bill is 9 percentage points higher in 2050 than in 2020.</content>

    <title>Creative Financing and Public Moral Hazard: Evidence from Medicaid and the Nursing Home Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the misallocation of Medicaid funds, its consequences for reimbursement rates, the quantity, and the quality of care provided. Combining two decades of administrative, audit, and survey data on U.S. nursing homes, we show that states employ creative financing schemes to divert federal matching funds from their intended purposes. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that, to increase federal matching funds, such schemes distort the quality-quantity tradeoff. In Indiana, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the rollout of a creative financing scheme, we find a disproportionate expansion of Medicaid-funded care for dementia patients in the lowest-quality nursing facilities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Evasion is a key obstacle to raising customs revenue. We study how improved administrative capacity enables governments to combat evasion by redesigning tariff codes. Using newly compiled historical records from the Early American Republic, we show that as Customs administration matured, the tariff code became more complex and more reliant on specific (quantity-based) tariffs in preference to ad valorem (value-based) ones.  We develop an equilibrium model of tariff administration with costly verification of declared values that explains these twin trends: Administrative capacity allows Customs officials to disaggregate goods and assess tailored specific tariffs, obviating misvaluation while minimizing price distortions.  The model successfully predicts several additional empirical patterns: Specific tariffs tend to be assessed on goods that are homogeneous, cheap, or lightly taxed.</content>

    <title>The Global Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The extent to which women participate in the labor market varies greatly across the globe. If such differences reflect distortions that women face in accessing good jobs, they can reduce economic activity through a misallocation of talent. In this paper, we build on Hsieh et al. (2019) to provide a methodology to quantify these productivity consequences. The index we propose, the ”Global Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)”, measures the losses in aggregate productivity that gender-based misallocation imposes. Our index allows us to separately identify labor demand distortions (e.g., discrimination in hiring for formal jobs) from labor supply distortions (e.g., frictions that discourage women’s labor force participation) and can be computed using data on labor income and job types. Our methodology also highlights an important distinction between welfare-relevant misallocation and the consequences on aggregate GDP if misallocation arises between market work and non-market activities. To showcase the versatility of our index, we analyze gender misallocation within countries over time, across countries over the development spectrum, and across local labor markets within countries. We find that misallocation is substantial and that demand distortions account for most of the productivity losses.</content>

    <title>What Do (Thousands of) Unions Do? Union-Specific Pay Premia and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of union heterogeneity in shaping wages and inequality among unionized workers. Using linked employer-employee data from Brazil and job moves across multi-firm unions, we estimate over 4,800 union-specific pay premia. Unions explain 3–4% of earnings variation. While unions raise wages on average, the standard deviation in union effects is large (6–7%). Validating our approach, wages fall in markets with higher vs. lower union premia following a nationwide right-to-work law. Linking premia to detailed data on union attributes, we find that unions with strike activity, collective bargaining agreements, internal competition, and skilled leaders secure higher wages. High-premium unions compress wage gaps by education while the average union exacerbates them. Post right-to-work, however, worker support for high-premium unions falls when between-group bargaining differentials are large. Our findings show that unions are not a monolith—their structure and actions shape their wage effects and, consequently, worker support.</content>

    <title>Partial Language Acquisition: The Impact of Conformity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes patterns of majority language acquisition in an economy consisting of a majority group and multiple minority groups. We consider contexts in which allows individuals choose among three options: full learning, partial learning, or no learning of the majority language. The key innovation in our approach is the introduction of a conformity factor in language acquisition, where peer pressure and community status may outweigh communicative and economic incentives for some individuals. Notably, we identify a non-monotonic relationship between the level of conformity and the distribution of full learners, partial learners, and non-learners in equilibrium. This finding is significant for policy considerations, as small adjustments in language acquisition costs may unpredictably influence language acquisition patterns across minority groups.</content>

Over 70 percent of enrollees choose the same plan as their spouse. Even among those with differing healthcare needs, well over half do so. Discrete-choice models suggest beneficiaries value being on the same plan as their spouse at over a thousand dollars per year. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we show that younger spouses disproportionately follow their older spouse’s plan choice. Joint plan choice contributes modestly to overall overspending, but increases costs substantially for the couples with different cost-minimizing plans.</content>

    <title>Why Does Value-Added Work? Implications of a Dynamic Model of Student Achievement</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Non-experimental value-added models have been shown to yield forecast-unbiased estimates of teacher and school effects.  To investigate, we propose a dynamic state-space model of knowledge accumulation, in which test scores are imperfect measures of knowledge, and students receive temporary and persistent shocks to their stock of knowledge each period.  The model identifies two primary sources of bias: transient factors in baseline scores (measurement error or transitory effects of prior teachers) and heterogeneous student growth rates.  We propose diagnostic tests and corrections for each.  Using eleven years of data from North Carolina, we find little evidence of heterogeneous student growth.  Rather, the primary source of bias is attenuation of the baseline coefficient, which opens the door to selection on correlates of true baseline knowledge.  Although conventional value-added estimates are biased for individual teachers due to attenuation, we find they are forecast unbiased when applied across a sample of teachers, due to the offsetting relationship between bias and teachers’ true effectiveness.  When achievement follows the state-space model and there is no heterogeneity in growth rates, the attenuation-corrected value-added model (ACVAM) should yield unbiased estimates of a wide range educational interventions, not just teachers and schools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and estimate a spatial search-and-bargaining model to study the role of intermediaries and spatial frictions using data from the used-car market. We find that dealers earn price premiums by leveraging three key advantages: selective acquisition of higher-quality cars, superior matching efficiency, and greater bargaining power. Counterfactual simulations reveal that selective intermediation and spatial segmentation significantly affect market efficiency and consumer welfare. While dealers extract more surplus per transaction than sellers, policies reducing dealers' advantages increase search frictions and lower overall welfare. Counterintuitively, reducing spatial frictions harms consumers by shifting trade to less efficient private-seller channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platforms, retailers, and other firms often offer their own products alongside products sold by competitors. We study the effects of this practice by combining a field experiment that hides brands owned by Amazon (i.e., private labels) from shoppers on Amazon.com with model-based counterfactuals and welfare analysis.  In the absence of private labels, consumers substitute toward products that are similar along most observable dimensions. Removing Amazon brands does not change consumers' search effort or their propensity to shop at other retail websites. Despite the ample availability of observably similar alternatives, our welfare estimates imply that, for the categories we study, removing Amazon brands would reduce consumer surplus by 5.5 percent in the short run, with approximately 10 percent of the impact due to equilibrium price increases by other sellers. The effects are heterogeneous, with consumer surplus reductions exceeding 10 percent in some categories, while other categories realize much smaller decreases when Amazon brands are removed. Demoting private labels in search results to counteract potential self-preferencing does not lead to gains in consumer surplus. This outcome arises because a subset of consumers derive greater utility from private labels and benefit from their high placement in search results.</content>

    <title>Control Without Ownership: Governance of Nonprofit Hospitals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of the governance structures of nonprofit hospitals and hospital systems. We study both the internal governance mechanisms (boards of directors, incentive contracts) and external mechanisms (market for corporate control, government oversight), with particular focus on the latter. Nonprofit boards are unusually large, include employee directors, exhibit less industry expertise among outside directors, and face weak external oversight. CEO pay and turnover are largely unresponsive to non-financial metrics such as quality or charity provision. The disciplinary role of the market for corporate control is also weaker in the nonprofit sector: nonprofits with poor financial performance are half as likely to be acquired or closed as for-profits, and weak performance on non-financial metrics has no effect on acquisitions or closures. Using time-series and cross-sectional variation in state oversight of nonprofits, we find that oversight strength explains a substantial portion of the gap in takeover rates between for-profits and nonprofits.

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study an intervention by a brokerage firm providing advisory services to high-net-worth investors. In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows that by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information, financial firms can successfully reduce their clients’ biases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information frictions significantly shape students' academic trajectories, but their differential impact across student backgrounds remains understudied. Using a novel panel survey capturing incoming students' subjective expectations and anonymized transcript data from Arizona State University, we first show that parental education strongly predicts educational success, even after controlling for demographics and measurable college preparation. First-generation students enter college less informed and with more uncertain beliefs, facing substantial challenges stemming from limited understanding and uncertainty about the higher education setting. A Bayesian expected utility maximization model demonstrates that higher uncertainty alone can sustain persistent achievement gaps. Empirically, students update their beliefs and make academic decisions consistent with the model’s predictions. Finally, leveraging a natural experiment involving a targeted first-year experience program for academically marginal students, we demonstrate that cost-effective interventions can successfully reduce knowledge frictions, improve retention, and encourage beneficial early major switching.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Deposit Flightiness and its Impact on Financial Stability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that deposit flightiness varies significantly over time, peaking after Covid-19. Elevated deposit flightiness coincides with QE and low interest rates.   We rationalize these trends based on heterogeneity in investors’ convenience value. Investors in the banking system value the convenience benefits of deposits more than outside investors. Following deposit inflows, e.g., due to QE's reserve expansions, the marginal depositor in the banking system becomes less convenience seeking and the risk of panic runs increases.   As a result,  policy rate hikes  are more destabilizing when preceded by QE. Our findings reveal a novel linkage between conventional and unconventional monetary policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new dataset built from a global non-profit startup program for early-stage high-technology startups called Creative Destruction Lab (CDL). The early stages of startup formation remain one of the least understood aspects of firm growth. The nature of this program and the data collected from its operations are well suited to investigate open questions in entrepreneurial strategy, entrepreneurial finance, advice, and technology transfer. This dataset combines three critical features for rigorous empirical research. First, the large, multi-year sample includes roughly 15,000 applicants, 9,000 founders in admitted startups, and nearly 2,000 mentors. Second, CDL recognized the academic value from the outset and built enterprise IT linking venture-level characteristics, structured longitudinal records of firm development and operations, and unstructured verbatim transcripts of mentor–founder discussions. Third, the data cover 27 technological domains such as therapeutics and quantum computing. This paper provides an overview of the setting from which data is collected, a high-level description of available data, and information on how to access these data for research.</content>

    <title>Navigating the College Affordability Crisis: Insights from College Savings Accounts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With higher education costs consistently outpacing inflation and public funding declining, college affordability has become a critical barrier to economic mobility for middle- and low-income families. While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higher-income, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of post-graduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation.</content>

    <title>Carbon Pricing and Inequality: A Normative Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite broad acceptance among economists, carbon taxes face persistent public resistance. We measure the sources and distribution of welfare losses from unexpected European carbon price changes by estimating their impact on consumer prices, labor income, financial wealth, and government transfers. A 1% carbon-policy-induced increase in energy prices yields an average welfare loss of about 1.5% of a year’s consumption, primarily driven by indirect labor-income effects. Younger, poorer, and less educated households, especially in Southern and Eastern Europe, bear a disproportionate burden. These findings suggest public opposition to carbon taxes stems from legitimate distributional concerns.</content>

    <title>Public Procurement vs. Regulated Competition in Selection Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common approach to markets with adverse selection is to regulate competition to minimize inefficiencies, while preserving consumer choice among firms. We study the role of procurement auctions—leading to sole provision by the winning firm—as an alternative market design. Relative to regulated competition, auctions affect product variety, quality, markups, and remove cream-skimming incentives. We develop a framework to study this comparison and apply it to individual health insurance in the US. We find that procurement auctions would increase consumer welfare in most markets, mainly by limiting inefficiencies from adverse selection and market power, and by increasing quality.</content>

    <title>The Extraordinary Rise in the Wealth of Older American Households</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There has been a seismic shift in age-wealth profiles in the U.S. over years 1983 to 2022. The most notable is the sharp rise in the relative household wealth of age group 75 and over. Correspondingly, the relative wealth holdings of all other age groups dropped over these years. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, the paper focuses on the youngest age group, 35 and under, and the oldest age group, 75 and over, and analyzes the factors behind these relative shifts in wealth. I find that the three principal factors are the homeownership rate, total stocks directly and indirectly owned, and home mortgage debt. The homeownership rate is the same in the two years for the youngest group but falls relative to the overall rate, whereas it shoots up for the oldest group both in actual level and relative to the overall average. The value of stock holdings rises for both age groups but vastly more for the oldest households compared to the youngest ones and accounts for a substantial portion of the elderly’s relative wealth gains. Mortgage debt rises in dollar terms for both groups but considerably more in relative terms for the youngest group.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the multifaceted relationship between culture and health from an economic perspective, integrating insights from anthropology, psychology, and political science. It begins by examining how culture provides meaning to illness and suffering and explores how culturally grounded “disease theory systems” influence beliefs about what causes illness, how and whether suffering should be remedied, and the appropriate role of the state in allocating health care resources. The importance of culture in defining the boundary between normal and abnormal pathology is highlighted via case studies. The chapter next reviews evidence on how health behaviors such as smoking, firearm ownership, dietary practices, and reproductive decisions are influenced by cultural norms of masculinity and religiosity. Lastly, it examines how firms, governments, and civil society leverage and advance cultural narratives to influence individual behavior and public policy. Thus, culture in relation to health both naturally evolves and is actively constructed, with implications for health inequality and health policy.</content>

    <title>Decomposing Trends in the Gender Gap for Highly Educated Workers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the gender gap in log earnings among full-time, college-educated workers born between 1931 and 1984. Using data from the National Survey of College Graduates and other sources, we decompose the gender earnings gap across birth cohorts into three components: (i) gender differences in the relative returns to undergraduate and graduate fields, (ii) gender-specific trends in undergraduate field, graduate degree attainment, and graduate field, and (iii) a cohort-specific “residual component” that shifts the gender gap uniformly across all college graduates. We have three main findings. First, when holding the relative returns to fields constant, changes in fields of study contribute 0.128 to the decline in the gender gap. However, this decline is partially offset by cohort trends in the relative returns to specific fields that favored men over women, reducing the contribution of field-of-study changes to the decline to 0.055. Second, gender differences in the relative returns to undergraduate and graduate fields of study contribute to the earnings gap, but they play a limited role in explaining its decline over time. Third, much of the convergence in earnings between the 1931 and 1950 cohorts is due to a declining “residual component.” The residual component remains stable for cohorts born between 1951 and the late 1970s, after which it resumes its decline.</content>

    <title>Economic Incentives and Organ Procurement: Evidence from a U.S. Reform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2019, the United States implemented new regulations for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) aimed at increasing transparency and strengthening accountability. These rules introduced stronger performance incentives designed to improve organ procurement outcomes. This paper examines the impact of the reform on organ donations, transplant activity, and associated system costs, with a particular focus on kidneys, given their clinical characteristics and the structure of the reform’s organizational incentives. We estimate that the new policy led to an average increase of 7.13 kidneys procured per OPO per month, relative to a baseline mean of 24.78. The largest effects are observed among top-performing OPOs prior to the reform, with similar patterns for transplanted organs. Consistent with these findings, we document an overall rise in total OPO costs, with statistically significant increases concentrated among low-performing OPOs. Finally, we present a back-of-the-envelope calculation estimating the fiscal impact of the reform.</content>
