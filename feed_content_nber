    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using newly-collected data on the near-population of U.S. STEM PhD graduates since 1950, we examine who funds PhD training, how many graduates are trained in areas of strategic national importance, and the effects of public investment in PhD training on the scientific workforce. The U.S. federal government is by far the largest source of financial and in-kind support for STEM PhD training in America. We identify universities and fields where PhD training has a higher or lower intensity of government, industry, or philanthropic support, and the organizations and universities that fund and train the most PhDs in critical technology areas such as AI, quantum information technology, and biotechnology. Leveraging variation in government support across agencies and over time, we provide evidence suggesting that increasing government-funded PhD trainees increases PhD production roughly one-for-one. To support further research, we provide public datasets at multiple levels of aggregation, reporting PhD graduates by (i) critical technology area and (ii) source of support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Timely business-level measures of work from home (WFH) are scarce for the U.S. economy. We review prior survey-based efforts to quantify the incidence and character of WFH and describe new questions that we developed and fielded for the Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS). Drawing on more than 150,000 firm-level responses to the BTOS, we obtain four main findings. First, nearly a third of businesses have employees who work from home, with tremendous variation across sectors. The share of businesses with WFH employees is nearly ten times larger in the Information sector than in Accommodation and Food Services. Second, employees work from home about 1 day per week, on average, and businesses expect similar WFH levels in five years. Third, feasibility aside, businesses’ largest concern with WFH relates to productivity. Seven percent of businesses find that onsite work is more productive, while two percent find that WFH is more productive. Fourth, there is a low level of tracking and monitoring of WFH activities, with 70% of firms reporting they do not track employee days in the office and 75% reporting they do not monitor employees when they work from home. These lessons serve as a starting point for enhancing WFH-related content in the American Community Survey and other household surveys.</content>

    <title>How the 1942 Japanese Exclusion Impacted U.S. Agriculture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the early 1940s, Japanese American farmers represented a highly skilled segment of the agricultural workforce in the Western United States, characterized by higher education levels and more specialized farming expertise than U.S.-born farmers. During World War II, around 110,000 Japanese Americans (and 22,000 agricultural workers among them) were forcibly relocated from an “exclusion zone” along the West Coast to internment camps. Most never returned to farming.  Using county-level panel data from historical agricultural censuses and a triple-difference (DDD) estimation approach we find that, by 1960, counties in the exclusion zone experienced 12% lower cumulative growth in assessed farm value for each percentage point reduction of their 1940 share of Japanese farm workers, relative to counties outside the exclusion zone. These counties also lagged in farm revenues, adoption of high-value crops, mechanization, and adoption of commercial fertilizer. We present suggestive evidence of broader negative spillovers to local economic growth beyond the agricultural sector. Taken together, our findings highlight the long-run economic costs of this policy, illustrating how the loss of skilled farmers can reduce agricultural growth and, in a time of fast technological adoption, may have negative effects on the whole regional development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The neoclassical economics of childbearing turns 65 this year, marking the anniversary of Gary Becker’s foundational article on the subject in 1960. This review article begins with a study of how childbearing has evolved in the United States over the last century, identifying distinctive features of the post-1960 era. Next, the article discusses standard neoclassical models of childbearing and shows how augmenting them with a supply side, which includes access to and information about contraception and abortion, increases their explanatory power. After reviewing recent quasi-experimental research testing this augmented model, the final part of the article reflects upon the implications of the recent transformation in US fertility rates for women and children and suggests fruitful avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>Accounting Standards and Antidumping Investigations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We uncover a new real effect of harmonizing accounting standards on international trade: following a mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, exporters experiencing a greater change in reporting requirements become more successful in defending against foreign antidumping cases. The effect is also stronger with better reporting enforcement and is robust to excluding exporters from non-market economies. We discuss channels through which accounting-standards globalization facilitates efficient trade by either mitigating importing countries’ protectionism or curtailing exporters’ dumping activities.</content>

    <title>A Macroeconomic Model of Central Bank Digital Currency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a quantitative New Keynesian DSGE model with monopolistic banks to study the macroeconomic effects of introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Households benefit from an expansion of liquidity services and higher deposit rates as bank deposit market power is curtailed, while bank profitability and lending decline. We assess this trade-off for a wide range of economies that differ in their level of interest rates. We find substantial welfare gains from introducing a CBDC with an optimal rate that can be approximated by a simple rule of thumb: the maximum between 0% and the policy rate minus 1%.</content>

    <title>Mergers and Quality Provision in Healthcare: Evidence from Nursing Homes</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper tests whether mergers between nursing home chains and independent facilities affect quality of care using facility-level data from 1999-2019. Staggered difference-in-differences estimates suggest that acquired facilities experience a 5% reduction in health deficiency citations 2 years post-merger. This improvement relies on the continuous supply of efficiency from chains; persists for four years; and is specific to mergers between chains and independent homes. Quality effects are driven by mergers involving smaller, higher-quality and non-private-equity-owned chains. A structural model suggests that the quality effect is generated by enhanced cost efficiency achieved by facilities serving larger numbers of residents after mergers.</content>

    <title>Private Equity and Workers: Modeling and Measuring Monopsony, Implicit Contracts, and Efficient Reallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the real effects of private equity buyouts on worker outcomes by building a new database that links transactions to matched employer-employee data in the United States. To guide our empirical analysis, we derive testable implications from three theories in which private equity managers alter worker outcomes: (1) exertion of monopsony power in concentrated markets, (2) breach of implicit contracts with targeted groups of workers, including managers and top earners, and (3) efficient reallocation of workers across plants. We do not find any evidence that private equity-backed firms vary wages and employment based on local labor market power proxies. Wage losses are also very similar for managers and top earners. Instead, we find strong evidence that private equity managers downsize less productive plants relative to productive plants while simultaneously reallocating high-wage workers to more productive plants. We conclude that post-buyout employment and wage dynamics are consistent with professional investors providing incentives to increase productivity and monitor the companies in which they invest.</content>

    <title>Do Physicians Follow the Golden Rule? Evidence of Imperfect Agency and Moral Hazard from Physicians’ Self-Prescriptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins), we study differences in the treatments chosen by Danish physicians for themselves versus for their patients. We estimate that physicians discount patient health benefit relative to their own, valuing the additional potency of a stronger statin by significantly more if it is for their own use. We exploit variation in expected coinsurance to estimate that moral hazard accounts for a modest share, no more than 15%, of this additional valuation. Statin-using physicians also respond more quickly to a patent expiration, suggesting greater effort to stay informed on drug classes they personally use.</content>

    <title>Coordination and Cooperation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An extensive experimental literature has documented miscoordination in establishing cooperative relationships when they can be supported in indefinitely repeated games: some people systematically try to cooperate, while others do not. The literature has had little success in finding personal characteristics that correlate systematically with these behaviors. We show that subjects who play the risky but efficient action in a simple coordination game (i.e., play stag in a stag hunt game) are significantly more likely to cooperate in indefinitely repeated games. This suggests that subjects who are less susceptible to strategic uncertainty are more likely to attempt to establish cooperative relationships.</content>

    <title>Attribute Production and Biased Technical Change in Automobiles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cars have gotten bigger and faster yet more fuel efficient in recent decades. Why? We estimate an equilibrium model of car attribute production using U.S. household microdata for 1995–2017 and structurally decompose attribute trends into underlying mechanisms. We find that technical change led to gains in all attributes. Rising gas prices boosted efficiency but were offset by surging demand for size and acceleration. Efficiency standards were largely ineffective. We show that using technology alone to meet tighter standards quadruples compliance costs, while half the efficiency gain from a fuel-saving technology subsidy is reallocated to other attributes in equilibrium.</content>

    <title>Small Business Innovation Applied to National Needs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Small businesses have long supplied a disproportionate share of major innovations in the United States. We review a centerpiece policy on this topic: the US Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. We trace its legislative history and summarize program evaluations over the past four decades. Using newly matched data on SBIR awards and venture capital investments into small businesses, we show that, despite often being compared to venture-backed businesses, SBIR-backed businesses pursue very different strategies. We use simple economic theories to motivate the SBIR program as a vehicle for the government to invest in small-scale, well-defined, but risky technologies that have large externalities, and we highlight a number of case studies consistent with this framework. Because the motivating friction lies at the level of ideas, our perspective encourages future evaluations to determine how the SBIR program influences not just who does the inventing, but what gets invented. Looking forward we discuss how rising industrial concentration and the diffusion of artificial intelligence may reshape the program’s comparative advantage in the innovation policy toolkit.</content>

    <title>State of the Art: Economic Development Through the Lens of Paintings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes 630,000 paintings from 1400 onward to uncover how visual art reflects its socioeconomic context. We develop a learning algorithm to predict nine basic emotions conveyed in each painting and isolate a context effect—the emotional signal shared across artworks created in the same location and year—controlling for artist, genre, and epoch-specific influences. These emotion distributions encode subtle but meaningful information about the living standards, uncertainty, or inequality characterizing the context in which the artworks were produced. We propose this emotion-based measure, derived from historical artworks, as a novel lens to examine how societies experienced major socioeconomic transformations, including climate variability, trade dynamics, technological change, shifts in knowledge production, and political transitions.</content>

    <title>Firewood in the American Economy: 1700 to 2010.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the central role of firewood in the development of the early American economy, prices for this energy fuel are absent from official government statistics and the scholarly literature. This paper presents the most comprehensive dataset of firewood prices in the United States compiled to date, encompassing over 6,000 price quotes from 1700 to 2010. Between 1700 and 2010, real firewood prices increased by between 0.2% and 0.4%, annually, and from 1800 to the Civil War, real prices increased especially rapidly, between 0.7% and 1% per year. Rising firewood prices and falling coal prices led to the transition to coal as the primary energy fuel. Between 1860 and 1890, the income elasticity for firewood switched from 0.5 to -0.5. Beginning in the last decade of the 18th century, firewood output increased from about 18% of GDP to just under 30% of GDP in the 1830s. The value of firewood fell to less than 5% of GDP by the 1880s. Prior estimates of firewood output in the 19th century significantly underestimated its value. Finally, incorporating the new estimates of firewood output into agricultural production leads to higher estimates of agricultural productivity growth prior to 1860 than previously reported in the literature.</content>

    <title>The Political Economy of Stimulus Transfers</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stimulus transfers are widely used during economic downturns, yet they are often poorly targeted from an economic perspective. I show that political incentives might help explain this discrepancy. I study one of the largest stimulus tax credits in Italy which excluded the poorest individuals and targeted middle-income earners. Leveraging quasi-random geographic variation in recipient shares and a difference-in-differences design, I find that the transfer raised the incumbent party’s vote share by 0.18 percentage points per 1 pp rise in recipients. These gains persist for at least five years. Political returns are stronger in areas with relatively richer beneficiaries, despite weaker consumption responses, and electoral punishment for exclusion is similarly asymmetric: higher-income excluded individuals reduce support for the incumbent, while poorer excluded individuals do not. Voters also punish incumbents when transfers are revoked, helping explain why temporary programs are rarely repealed. A counterfactual transfer targeting poorer households would have increased the consumption response by 30\% but reduced electoral returns by at least 15\%. These findings highlight a key political-economy trade-off in stimulus design, where electoral incentives skew transfers toward politically responsive recipients, as opposed to consumption responsive recipients.

    <title>The Power Asymmetry in Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design, the probability of treatment jumps when a running variable (R) passes a threshold (R0). Fuzzy RD estimates are obtained via a procedure analogous to two-stage least squares (2SLS), where an indicator I(R &gt; R0) plays the role of the instrument. Recently, Keane and Neal (2023, 2024) showed that 2SLS t-tests suffer from a “power asymmetry”: 2SLS standard errors are spuriously small (large) when the 2SLS estimate is close to (far from) the OLS estimate. Here, we show that a similar problem arises in Fuzzy RD. Hence, if the endogeneity bias is positive, the Fuzzy RD t-test has little power to detect true negative effects, and inflated power to find false positives. The problem persists even if the instrument is very strong. To avoid this problem one should rely exclusively on the intent-to-treat (ITT) regression to assess significance of the treatment effect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Monetary policy transmits through broad financial conditions—interest rates, asset prices, credit spreads and exchange rates—rather than through the policy rate alone. Yet current frameworks remain anchored around r*, the neutral interest rate. We introduce FCI*, the neutral level of financial conditions that closes expected output gaps, within a framework where financial conditions and macroeconomic shocks drive economic activity with inertia. Conceptually, FCI* reflects macroeconomic developments rather than financial market valuations, making it more stable than r*, which responds to both macroeconomic and financial factors. We estimate FCI* using a two-equation model along the lines of Laubach and Williams (2003) with 1990-2024 data. Our empirical estimates reveal three findings. First, estimated FCI* remained stable after the 2008 crisis while r* declined persistently due to asset price declines. Second, since the observed FCI reflects financial market shocks, large FCI gaps emerge especially during recessions. Third, at times of rapid monetary policy changes, FCI gaps more accurately reflect the effective policy stance because FCI is driven by forward-looking markets; for example, FCI gaps correctly identified the 2022 tightening when interest rate measures still suggested accommodation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do advanced technology adoption and venture capital (VC) funding impact employment and growth? An analysis of data from the US Census Bureau suggests that while both advanced technology use and VC funding matter on their own for firm outcomes, their joint presence is most strongly correlated with higher employment levels. VC presence is linked with a high increase in employment, though primarily among a limited subset of firms. In contrast, technology adoption is associated with a smaller rise in employment, yet it influences a considerably larger number of firms. A model of startups is created, focusing on decisions to use advanced technology and seek VC funding. The model is compared with firm-level data on employment, advanced technology use, and VC investment. Several thought experiments are conducted using the model. Some experiments assess the importance of advanced technology and VC in the economy. Others examine the reallocation effects across firms with different technology choices and funding sources in response to shifts in taxes and subsidies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how central banks can strategically integrate artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance their operations. Using a dual-framework approach, we demonstrate how AI can transform both strategic decision-making and daily operations within central banks, taking the Federal Reserve System (FRS) as a representative example. We first consider a top-down view, showing how AI can modernize key central banking functions. We then adopt a bottom-up approach focusing on the impact of generative AI on specific tasks and occupations within the Federal Reserve and find a significant potential for workforce augmentation and efficiency gains. We also address critical challenges associated with AI adoption, such as the need to upgrade data infrastructure and manage workforce transitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries seek to promote exports by subsidizing market access, but evidence on such efforts has been mixed. We present the first randomized evaluation of a government financial-support program explicitly targeting exports, the Tasdir+ program in Tunisia. The program offered matching grants for fixed market-access costs but not variable costs. Tracking outcomes in administrative data, we find positive effects on exports on average. We find limited impacts on the number of destinations or exported products, which were stated policy targets. The finding that the fixed-cost subsidies expanded exports on the intensive margin but not the extensive margins of destinations or products stands in contrast to the predictions of several workhorse trade models.</content>

    <title>Transitory and Permanent Import Tariff Shocks in the United States: An Empirical Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate transitory and permanent import tariff shocks in the United States over the postwar period. We find that transitory tariff increases are neither inflationary nor contractionary, and are not associated with monetary tightening. In contrast, permanent tariff increases trigger a temporary rise in inflation (a one-off increase in the price level) and a brief tightening of monetary policy. Consistent with the intertemporal approach to the balance of payments, transitory tariff increases reduce imports and improve the trade balance, whereas permanent increases leave both largely unchanged. Transitory shocks account for approximately 80 percent of tariff movements. Overall, tariff shocks are estimated to be a minor driver of U.S. business cycle fluctuations on average and even during episodes of substantial tariff hikes, such as Nixon 1971, Ford 1975, and Trump 2018.</content>

    <title>The Revenue and Distributional Impacts of Unemployment Insurance Reform: Evidence from California</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, unemployment insurance (UI) is funded through employer-side payroll taxes that are experience-rated based on previous UI claims. States differ significantly with respect to the financing of their programs, and a majority of state programs do not currently meet minimum UI trust fund solvency standards. A common culprit in the least solvent states is a very low tax base of earnings on which UI taxes are levied. We focus on California, the least solvent of the 50 state UI programs, with debt currently to the federal government of $21 billion, and which has the lowest base of taxable earnings at $7000 per year. We use matched employer-employee administrative data to estimate the impact of financing reforms to California’s UI system. We find that raising the taxable earnings base would replenish the state’s UI trust fund and would increase experience rating by reducing the number of systematically subsidized firms. While this improves vertical equity of the UI system, it would also worsen horizontal equity by imposing much larger percentage increases in tax costs on the firms with the fewest layoffs. Alternatively, matching the higher tax base with both higher maximum and lower minimum rates could improve both experience rating and horizontal equity.</content>

    <title>Where Discovery Happens: Research Institutions and Fundamental Knowledge in the Life-Sciences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fundamental knowledge in the life sciences has consequential implications for medicine and subsequent medical innovations. Using publications in leading life science journals to measure fundamental knowledge, we document large agglomerations in the institutions where it is discovered and a robust correlation between knowledge and subsequent citations in patents. We assess whether the institution where research is produced affects the output of scientists by using a scientist-mover design, which compares annual research output before and after a move for the same scientist. Between 50 − 60% of a scientist’s research output is attributable to the institution where they work, and two thirds of this effect is driven by the presence of star researchers. The magnitude of these effects has not decreased in more recent time periods, in the wake of technologies that make cross-institution collaborations easier, nor is it larger for moves to larger agglomerations, nor concentrated in particular scientific fields. We discuss the implications of these findings for research allocations in science and scientists’ leaving one institution for another.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the economic impacts of one of the world's largest anti-corruption crackdowns, Brazil's Operação Lava Jato (Car Wash). Using a difference-in-differences analysis of unique, matched firm-bank data, we find sizable declines in employment and wage bills for investigated firms, alongside reduced access to credit. We also find adverse indirect effects through the bank credit channel, where highly exposed banks reduce credit to non-investigated firms, particularly for politically connected existing borrowers. Non-investigated firms exposed to the economic shock through their bank relationships suffer declines in wage bills and employment. The findings highlight the intricate economic implications of anti-corruption policies targeting large corporations.</content>

    <title>Effects of the Minimum Wage on Employment of Young Adults with Cognitive Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study analyzes, for the first time, the effect of increases in the minimum wage on the labor market outcomes of working age adults with cognitive disabilities, a vulnerable and low-skilled sector of the actual and potential labor pool. Using data from the American Community Survey (2008-2023), we estimated effects of the minimum wage on employment, labor force participation, weeks worked, and hours worked among working age individuals with cognitive disabilities using a generalized difference-in-differences research design. We found that a higher effective minimum wage leads to reduced employment and labor force participation among individuals with cognitive disabilities but has no significant effect on labor supply at the intensive margin for this group. Adverse impacts were particularly pronounced for those with lower educational attainment. In contrast, we found no significant labor market effects of an increase in the minimum wage for individuals with physical disabilities or in the non-disabled population.</content>

    <title>Why Is Fertility So Low in High Income Countries?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Melissa Schettini Kearney &amp; Phillip B. Levine</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers why fertility has fallen to historically low levels in virtually all high-income countries. Using cohort data, we document rising childlessness at all observed ages and falling completed fertility. This cohort perspective underscores the need to explain long-run shifts in fertility behavior. We review existing research and conclude that period-based explanations focused on short-term changes in income or prices cannot explain the widespread decline. Instead, the evidence points to a broad reordering of adult priorities with parenthood occupying a diminished role. We refer to this phenomenon as “shifting priorities” and propose that it likely reflects a complex mix of changing norms, evolving economic opportunities and constraints, and broader social and cultural forces. We review emerging evidence on all these factors. We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research and a brief discussion of policy implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lab-in-the-field experiments, in which lab experiments are conducted in more naturalistic settings, are increasingly being implemented in developing country contexts. In this chapter, we outline the conceptual and logistical challenges typically associated with lab-in-the-field experiments in non-Western settings. We describe the importance of worldviews and how researcher preconceptions may inadvertently shape the types of research questions that are asked. We emphasize the importance of increasing diversity of subject pools and researchers. We also suggest a set of best practices when implementing lab-in-the-field experiments in developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extensions in human longevity are prompting a growing interest in maximizing healthspan, or the number of years of life unencumbered by the chronic diseases of old age. This chapter reviews recent research on healthy life extension, including several measures and determinants of longer healthspans. We also provide an overview of recent efforts by medical and business enterprises to enhance longevity and healthspan, followed by a discussion of policy and workplace options to foster healthier lives. Such efforts hold the promise of improving quality of life, expanding labor supply, and lowering the cost of health care costs associated with population aging.</content>

    <title>Doctor Discretion in Medical Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the importance of doctor discretion in medical evaluations. Leveraging comprehensive administrative data and random assignment of doctors to evaluations in workers’ compensation insurance, we identify the scope for doctor discretion in medical evaluations of injured workers and the impacts of this discretion on later claimant outcomes. Our analysis indicates there is wide variation across doctors in medical evaluations, these decisions are consequential for later claimant outcomes, and doctor effects vary systematically by observed doctor characteristics. In addition, we analyze the relationship between doctor effects in medical evaluations and market allocation when claimants can select their own doctors. Our findings suggest both claimants and insurers influence the allocation of doctors in line with their respective incentives, indicating market forces shape the distribution of program benefits. Finally, we conclude with supplemental counterfactual analysis and discussion of the policy implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>Do Pensions Enhance Teacher Effort and Selective Retention?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theoretical rationales for employer-provided pensions often focus on their ability to increase employee effort and selectively retain quality workers. We test these hypotheses using rich administrative data on public school teachers around the pension-eligibility threshold. When teachers cross the threshold, their effective compensation drops by over 50 percent of salary due to sharply reduced pension accrual rates. Standard economic models predict this compensation reduction should decrease teacher effort and output, yet we observe no such decline. This suggests that yearly pension accruals near retirement do not meaningfully increase effort. Similarly, if pensions selectively retained better teachers, we would expect average teacher quality to decline when the retentive incentive disappears at the threshold. Instead, we find no change in the composition of teacher quality, suggesting pensions do not selectively retain higher-performing workers in late career.</content>

    <title>Health Spillovers: The Broad Impact of Spousal Health Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we provide new evidence on the health spillover effects of health shocks within couples. Using administrative data from the Netherlands and a matching event-study framework, we estimate the causal effect of experiencing a health shock within a couple on the health of the initially unaffected partner. Our findings reveal a significant deterioration in the partner’s health outlook, characterized by substantial increases in hospital visits, overnight stays, and mortality. The health decline is broad in scope, encompassing higher risk of infections, accidents, and digestive and cardiovascular conditions. This deterioration is accompanied by substantial increases in stress, anxiety and depression for both men and women, as well as sleep disorders for women. These effects are not driven by a heavy caregiving load, financial distress or worsening of health behaviors. On the contrary, the adverse outcomes persist despite suggestive positive changes, including increased exercise for both men and women, and reduced alcohol consumption among women.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The development of English-language skills, a near necessity in today’s global economy, is heavily influenced by historical national decisions about whether to subtitle or dub TV content. While prior studies of language acquisition have focused on schools, we show the overwhelming influence of out-of-school learning. We identify the causal effect of subtitling in a difference-in-differences specification that compares English to math skills in European countries that do and do not use subtitles. We find a large positive effect of subtitling on English-language skills of over one standard deviation. The effect is robust to accounting for linguistic similarity, economic incentives to learn English, and cultural protectiveness. Consistent with oral TV transmission, the effect is larger for listening and speaking skills than for reading.</content>

    <title>Basel Endgame: Bank Capital Requirements and the Future of International Standard Setting</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2023, US regulators proposed the “Basel Endgame,” a long-awaited overhaul of bank capital requirements. The proposal aimed to bring the United States into compliance with international standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, fierce industry opposition to what banks viewed as a costly increase in capital requirements effectively killed the proposal. In this essay, we describe the purpose of bank capital and the history of international standard-setting in bank regulation. We then highlight the most important aspects of the Basel Endgame, as well as the arguments for and against adopting the rule. We show that the debate unnecessarily conflated two distinct questions: (1) whether the United States should comply with international regulatory standards, and (2) whether the United States should raise large banks’ capital requirements. While there are strong grounds to answer both questions in the affirmative, they need not be addressed together. That is, the United States can implement international standards in a capital-neutral manner to preserve global cooperation in bank regulation, leaving the separate question of raising capital requirements for another day.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Biological drugs account for just two percent of prescriptions filled in the U.S. but fifty percent of prescription-drug spending.  To explore the role patents play in explaining high biologics prices, we build the first comprehensive database of patents associated with all FDA-approved biologics.  We first establish that much of what drives biologic patenting is the desire to block entry by competing biosimilars.  For these purposes, we estimate the response to a 2010 Act that created an abbreviated pathway for biosimilars to receive FDA approval.  We then document robust evidence consistent with two patenting strategies that may block biosimilar competition: thicketing and evergreening, whereby firms supplement primary patents with a dense web of later-expiring patents on secondary drug features.  We conduct various exercises to suggest that these behaviors are undertaken with exclusionary purposes that go beyond the traditional justifications of the patent system.  We then set forth various descriptive statistics surrounding biosimilar entry to suggest that these patenting strategies are, in fact, effective at delaying biosimilar entry.  Finally, we simulate the degree to which biologics patent portfolios are impacted by policy proposals currently under consideration to address thicketing and evergreening.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an empirical Bayes estimator for two-way effects in linked data sets based on a novel prior that leverages patterns of assortative matching observed in the data. To capture limited mobility we model the bipartite graph associated with the matched data in an asymptotic framework where its Laplacian matrix has small eigenvalues that converge to zero. The prior hyperparameters that control the shrinkage are determined by minimizing an unbiased risk estimate. We show the proposed empirical Bayes estimator is asymptotically optimal in compound loss, despite the weak connectivity of the bipartite graph and the potential misspecification of the prior. We estimate teacher values-added from a linked North Carolina Education Research Data Center student-teacher data set.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, central bankers’ speeches and other forms of communication have become pedagogical in nature, aiming to shape public knowledge, beliefs, expectations, and attitudes. With the shift toward expectations management as a monetary policy tool, central banks’ educational role has become a central component of their monetary policymaking, and central bank communication with the public has become a rapidly-growing area of research. I argue that this research is closely related, both thematically and methodologically, to the field of educational psychology. I discuss insights from educational psychology research that could guide central bank communication research—including insights about the challenges and pitfalls that both fields share.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geoeconomic pressure—the use of existing economic relationships by governments to achieve geopolitical or economic goals—is a prominent feature of global power dynamics. This paper introduces a methodology using large language models (LLMs) to systematically identify the application of and response to geoeconomic pressure from large textual corpora. We classify which governments apply pressure to which foreign targets, using which instruments, firms, and products. We demonstrate that firms affected by tariffs respond primarily with price changes whereas firms affected by export controls respond disproportionately by investing in research and development. We document significant heterogeneity in how firms respond to pressure based on whether their home government is applying the pressure, whether their home country is the recipient of the pressure, or whether they are based in an affected third party country. Finally, we quantify the degree of measurement uncertainty generated by the LLM-based analysis by comparing the classifications across multiple open-weight models as well as considering a wide range of variations of our prompts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Credit scores are a primary screening device for the allocation of credit, housing, and sometimes even employment. In the data, credit scores grow and fan out with age; at the same time, income and consumption inequality also increase with a cohort’s age. We postulate a simple model with hidden information to explore the joint determination of credit scores, income, and consumption over an individual’s lifetime which can replicate these empirical facts. We use the model to understand the role of technologies like big data or legal restrictions limiting information on certain adverse events like medical expenses intended to increase credit market access.</content>

    <title>Designing Consent: Choice Architecture and Consumer Welfare in Data Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the welfare consequences of choice architecture for online privacy using a field experiment that randomizes cookie consent banners. We study three ways in which firms or policymakers can influence choices: (1) nudging users through banner design to encourage acceptance of cookie tracking; (2) setting defaults when users dismiss banners; and (3) implementing consent decisions at the website versus browser level. Absent design manipulation, users accept all cookies more than half of the time. Placing cookie options behind extra clicks strongly influences choices, shifting users toward more easily accessible alternatives. Many users dismiss banners without making an explicit choice, underscoring the importance of default settings. Survey evidence further reveals substantial confusion about default settings. Using a structural model, we find that among consent policies requiring site-specific decisions, consumer surplus is maximized when consent interfaces clearly display all options and default to acceptance in the absence of an explicit choice. However, the welfare gains from optimizing banner design are much smaller than those from adopting browser-level consent, which eliminates the time costs of repeated decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a new model of competition between digital media platforms with targeted advertising. The model adds new insights around how user heterogeneity and overlap, along with user and advertiser substitution patterns, determine equilibrium ad load. We apply the model to evaluate the proposed separation of Facebook and Instagram. We estimate structural parameters using evidence on diminishing returns to advertising from a new randomized experiment and information on user overlap, diversion ratios, and price elasticity from earlier experiments. In counterfactual simulations, a Facebook-Instagram separation increases ad loads, transferring surplus from platforms and users to advertisers, with limited total surplus effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Preparing students for science, technology, and engineering careers is an urgent state policy challenge. We examine the design and roll-out of a science testing requirement for high-school graduation in Massachusetts. While science test performance has improved over time for all demographic subgroups, we observe rising inequality in failure rates and retest success. English learners, almost 8% of all test-takers, account for 53% of students who never pass. We find large differences by family income, even conditional on previous test scores, that raise equity implications. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we show that barely passing the exam increases high-school graduation and college outcomes of students near the score threshold, particularly for females and students from higher-income families.</content>

    <title>Jackpot for Good: Can Lottery Matches Increase Charitable Giving?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the effectiveness of donation matching gift schemes using lotteries for increasing charitable giving relative to deterministic matches of equivalent or higher expected value and a no-match control. We recruit 1,402 online participants and randomly assign them to one of seven conditions: No Match (Control), and two sets of matching schemes of varying equivalent expected values: EV=1 (1:1 Deterministic Match, 1:10% of 10 tokens, and 1:1% of 100) and EV=0.5 (2:1 Deterministic Match, 1:1% of 50 tokens and 1:0.5% of 100), where one token is $0.50. Participants complete three 10-token allocation decisions for hunger-related charities with one allocation randomly selected for realization. The 1:1 Match significantly increases giving by 15.7% compared to No Match. We find that matching schemes with a small probability of a very large amount (1% and 0.5% of 100) elicit significantly higher rates of giving compared to No Match (Mann-Whitney p=0.019 and p=0.096 respectively) and do not statistically differ from the 1:1 Match (Mann-Whitney p=0.976 and p=0.622 respectively). Our results suggest nonprofits can use matching gift donations more efficiently through lottery matching donation schemes while increasing downstream donations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sovereign debt yields have declined dramatically over the last half-century. Standard explanations, including aging populations and increases in asset demand from abroad, encounter difficulties when confronted with the full range of evidence. We propose an explanation based on a decline in inflation and default risk.  We show that a model with sovereign default captures the decline in interest rates, the stability of equity valuation ratios, and the reduction in investment and output growth.  Calibrations of the model post-Covid suggest that sovereign default risk may have returned.</content>

    <title>Firm Heterogeneity and Adverse Selection in External Finance: Micro Evidence and Macro Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the macroeconomic consequences of asymmetric information between firms and external investors. To do so, we develop a heterogeneous firm macro model in which firms have private information about their quality. Private information creates a lemons problem in the market for external finance, depressing investment relative to the full information benchmark. We measure the distribution of private information, and therefore the magnitude of this lemons problem, using high-frequency stock price changes when firms raise new funding (revealing their quality to the market).  We find that changes in distribution of private information are a quantitatively important determinant of aggregate fluctuations. For example, a spike in private information accounts for 40% of the decline in aggregate investment during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and made monetary stimulus significantly less effective at that time.</content>

    <title>Revisiting the Interest Rate Effects of Federal Debt</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the relationship between federal debt and interest rates, which is a key input for assessments of fiscal sustainability. Estimating this relationship is challenging due to confounding effects from business cycle dynamics and changes in monetary policy. A common approach is to regress long-term forward interest rates on long-term projections of federal debt. We show that issues regarding nonstationarity have become far more pronounced over the last 20 years, significantly biasing the recent estimates based on this methodology. Estimating the model in first differences addresses these concerns. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio raises the 5-year-ahead, 5-year Treasury rate by about 3 basis points, which is statistically and economically significant and highly robust. Roughly three-quarters of the increase in interest rates reflects term premia rather than expected short-term real rates.</content>

    <title>Broad Divisia Money, Supply Pressures, and U.S. Inflation Following the COVID-19 Recession</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of U.S. inflation in 2021 and 2022 and its partial subsiding have sparked debates about the relative role of supply and demand factors. The initial surge surprised many macroeconomists despite the unprecedented jump in money growth in 2020-21. We find that the relationship between consumption and the theoretically based Divisia M3 measure of money (velocity) can be well modeled both in the short- and long-runs. We use the estimated long-run relationship to calculate the deviation of actual velocity from its long-run equilibrium and incorporate it into a P-Star framework. Our model of velocity significantly improves the performance of the P-Star model relative to using a one-sided HP filter to calculate trend velocity as, for example, used by Belongia and Ireland (2015, 2017). We also include a global supply pressures index in the model and find that recent movements in U.S. inflation largely owed to aggregate demand driven macroeconomic factors that are tracked by Divisia money with a smaller role played by supply factors.</content>

    <title>Early and Accurate Recession Detection Using Classifiers on the Anticipation-Precision Frontier</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Pascal Michaillat</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a new algorithm for detecting US recessions in real time. The algorithm constructs millions of recession classifiers by combining unemployment and vacancy data to reduce detection noise. Classifiers are then selected to avoid both false negatives (missed recessions) and false positives (nonexistent recessions). The selected classifiers are therefore perfect, in that they identify all 15 historical recessions in the 1929–2021 training period without any false positives. By further selecting classifiers that lie on the high-precision segment of the anticipation-precision frontier, the algorithm optimizes early detection without sacrificing precision. On average, over 1929–2021, the classifier ensemble signals recessions 2.2 months after their true onset, with a standard deviation of detection errors of 1.9 months. Applied to May 2025 data, the classifier ensemble gives a 71% probability that the US economy is currently in recession. A placebo test and backtests confirm the algorithm’s reliability. The classifier ensembles trained on 1929–2004, 1929–1984, and 1929–1964 data in backtests give a current recession probability of 58%, 83%, and 25%, respectively.</content>

    <title>Wealth Inequality, Labor Market Arrangements and the Secular Decline in the Real Interest Rate</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic macroeconomic model in which the secular decline in real interest rates arises endogenously from rising wealth inequality. Challenging the standard “safe asset shortage” hypothesis, the model shows how falling real rates can coexist with a stable safe asset ratio—closely matching U.S. empirical patterns. The mechanism combines limited financial market participation, which concentrates capital ownership among a shrinking class of stockholders, with egalitarian wage bargaining, which generates time-varying labor income shares under incomplete markets. As inequality increases, stockholders face higher financial and operating leverage, increasing their consumption volatility and precautionary demand for bonds. At the same time, greater wage instability raises workers’ demand for safe assets. The resulting surge in precautionary savings from both groups depresses real returns and creates the appearance of a safe asset shortage, despite an unchanged supply. This outcome reflects a pecuniary externality: agents fail to internalize the aggregate constraint on safe assets, especially over the business cycle. Our calibrated model reproduces key macro-financial patterns and offers new insights into the joint dynamics of wealth distribution, labor market arrangements, and asset pricing.</content>

Using parents’ nationality at birth, we overcome the lack of ethno-racial statistics stemming from the country’s “color-blind” approach. We document substantial earnings penalties for racial minorities along the income distribution. Penalties are larger at the median than the top and for Middle-Eastern and North African (MENA) and Sub-Saharan African origin (Black) individuals. We compare racial inequality in France vs. the U.S. by simulating where French minorities would fall in the U.S. distribution. Black and Non-White individuals in France benefit from the country’s lower overall inequality, but experience comparable, occasionally larger, rank gaps.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most U.S. states have workforce development programs that offer firms grants to train their own workers. We create unique data linkages between participating firms, employment, and vacancies to explore the determinants and consequences of such programs. Training grants are more prevalent in markets where firms face greater employee poaching risk, suggesting these programs help overcome a market failure in updating worker skills. After training, firms experience prolonged employment growth and down-skilling in their job posts, relative to a matched control group. Training appears to help firms move toward optimal scale and expand opportunities for less skilled workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the effects of public debt on municipal services and real outcomes during financial crises using a unique archival dataset of U.S. cities from 1924 to 1943. Unlike today’s countercyclical fiscal policies, the Great Depression provides a rare setting to observe fiscal shocks without substantial intergovernmental or Federal Reserve support. My findings show that financial market frictions – especially the need to refinance debt – led cities to sharply cut expenditures, particularly on capital projects and police services. As urban development halted during the Depression, cities with high pre-crisis debt levels faced significant austerity pressures, a decline in population growth, a rise in crime, and a departure of skilled public servants from municipal governments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Characteristic-based factors embed large unpriced components that depress Sharpe ratios and deviate from the mean-variance efficient (MVE) frontier. We discuss how to decompose tradable factor returns into priced (MVE) and unpriced components, showing that hedging unpriced variation realigns factors with efficiency. We outline theoretical conditions for characteristic portfolios to span the MVE and describe practical hedge-portfolio construction. In some asset classes—currencies and sovereign bonds—real-time estimation of the MVE is feasible. In the case of equities, one can hedge unpriced risks from characteristic-based factors. Empirically, unpriced risks account for 30–99% of factor return variance, and hedging can more than double Sharpe ratios.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the importance of corporate assets in supporting debt. Prior studies typically see only secured debt as asset backed, while the rest is deemed cash flow based. This implies only a small fraction of US debt is asset backed. Yet because corporations often resist offering security explicitly to debt, much unsecured debt is implicitly asset backed. Moreover, we find that the degree to which unsecured debt is asset backed can change with a firm’s condition and the economic situation. Consequently, asset values can affect the quantum and price of borrowing, with effects accentuated in adverse economic conditions, as suggested by financial accelerator theories. Given that a corporation’s debt is typically supported by both expected cash flows and assets, with the relative support varying with time and situation, the industry practice of classifying debt as “asset based” or “cash flow based” is overly categorical, especially for long term corporate bonds.</content>

    <title>Income Elasticity of Demand for Healthy and Unhealthy Foods: Evidence from Lump-Sum Earned Income Tax Credit Payments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Earned Income Tax Credit is unique among social programs in that benefits are not paid out evenly across the calendar year but are received in a lump-sum cash payment. We exploit this feature of the EITC to investigate how receiving this influx of cash affects food expenditure patterns of eligible households. We find consistent evidence that households increase their spending on healthy foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and poultry, and dairy products when they receive their tax credit. Causal estimates of the spending response to this lump-sum payment are about twice as large as the cross-section variation in spending by income implies. By contrast, there is no measurable increase in spending on soft drinks including sodas and sports drinks, and evidence suggests that spending on soft drinks is relatively inelastic with regard to income.</content>

    <title>From Rural Schools to City Factories: Assessing the Quality of Chinese Rural Schools</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The changing pattern of quality in China’s rural schools across time and province is extracted from the differential labor market earnings of rural migrant workers. Variations in rates of return to years of schooling across migrant workers working in the same urban labor market but having different sites of basic education provide for direct estimation of provincial school quality. Corroborating this approach, these school quality estimates prove to be highly correlated with provincial cognitive skill test scores for the same demographic group. Returns to quality increase with economic development level of destination cities. Importantly, quality appears higher and provincial variation appears lower for younger cohorts, indicating at least partial effectiveness of more recent policies aimed at improving rural school quality across provinces. Surprisingly, however, provincial variations in quality are uncorrelated with teacher-student ratio or per student spending.</content>

    <title>Political Foundations of Racial Violence in the Post-Reconstruction South</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Election results act as powerful signals, shaping social behavior in ways that can be dramatic and even violent. This paper shows how racial violence in the post-Reconstruction U.S. South was tied to the local performance of the anti-Black Democratic Party in presidential elections. Using a regression discontinuity design based on close presidential vote shares, we find that Southern counties where Democrats lost the popular vote between 1880 and 1900 were nearly twice as likely to experience Black lynchings in the following four years. This backlash was enkindled by local elites, who amplified narratives of Black criminality through newspapers after such defeats. These findings point to the strategic use of racial violence by Democratic elites, prefiguring the formal vote suppression of Jim Crow.</content>

    <title>Tariffs and Trade Deficits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic multi-country Ricardian trade model with aggregate uncertainty, where countries trade goods and assets, leading to trade imbalances. We introduce a method for computing counterfactuals in this setting without specifying the stochastic process of shocks or solving for asset prices. Applying the model to tariff shocks, we quantify their effects on prices, income, expenditure, and trade imbalances. We find that higher U.S. tariffs reduce the U.S. trade deficit through general equilibrium adjustments, but raise domestic prices and lower real consumption. Our findings highlight that movements in trade imbalances are shaped by the structure of global trade and finance, and that attempts to influence external balances through changes in trade barriers carry significant implications for real economic outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should authorities that care about match quality and diversity allocate resources in the face of uncertainty? We introduce adaptive priority mechanisms (APM) that prioritize agents based on their scores and characteristics. We show that APM uniquely implement the ex post optimal allocation. The ubiquitous priority and quota mechanisms are optimal if and only if the authority is risk-neutral or extremely risk-averse over diversity, respectively. Deferred Acceptance implements the unique stable matching when all authorities use the optimal APM. We provide a practical roadmap for implementing APM as a market-design solution and illustrate this using Chicago Public Schools data.</content>

    <title>Rounding up the Effect of Tariffs on Financial Markets: Evidence from April 2, 2025</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the response of financial outcomes to the US announcement on April 2, 2025, of tariffs on nearly all its trading partners. To address the challenge posed by potential anticipation by economic agents, we decompose these tariffs into a component associated with bilateral deficits and an arguably unanticipated component resulting from the rounding up of the continuous deficit measure to the next whole number or to the baseline 10% rate. We measure the short-term response of stock prices and exchange rates, focusing on all countries with which the US has a bilateral deficit. For both outcomes, the round-up component’s effect is an order of magnitude larger than that of the deficit component. We find that a one percentage point higher tariff is associated with a statistically significant 0.23% decline in stock prices. Further, we find no evidence of a dollar appreciation; if anything, higher tariffs are associated with a dollar depreciation, driven by countries with a floating regime. We show this is consistent with a model that allows for trade reallocation and in which exports to the US are invoiced in dollars while exports to the rest of the world are partly invoiced in producer currency.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Bicycles for the Mind</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Steve Jobs described computers as “bicycles for the mind,” a tool that allowed people to dramatically leverage their capabilities. This paper presents a formal model of cognitive tools and technologies that enhance mental capabilities. We consider agents engaged in iterative task improvement, where cognitive tools are assumed to be substitutes for implementation skills and may or may not be complements to judgment, depending on their type. The ability to recognise opportunities to start or improve a process, which we term opportunity judgment, is shown to always complement cognitive tools. The ability to know which action to take in a given state, which we term payoff judgment, is not necessarily a complement to cognitive tools. Using these concepts, we can synthesise the empirical literature on the impact of computers and artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity and inequality. Specifically, while both computers and AI appear to increase productivity, computers have also contributed to increased inequality. Empirical work on the impact of AI on inequality has shown both increases and decreases, depending on the context. We also apply the model to understand how cognitive tools might influence incentives to automate processes and allocate decision-making authority within teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of state hospital regulations intended to increase breastfeeding by requiring certain care standards during the postpartum hospital stay. Policy adoption increased breastfeeding initiation by 3.3–4.1 percentage points (4.2–5.2 percent) and breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum by 6–9 percent. Further, following adoption, infant mortality declined by 0.2 deaths per 1,000 live births (3.5 percent), and infant hospitalization charges fell. Declines in mortality and charges primarily occurred among medically vulnerable infants, consistent with evidence that breast milk supports immune development. Additional evidence suggests that improvements in infant sleep practices also played a role in reducing mortality.</content>

    <title>Did California's Fast Food Minimum Wage Reduce Employment?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effect of California's $20 fast food minimum wage, which was enacted in September 2023 and went into effect in April 2024, on employment in the fast food sector. In unadjusted data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that employment in California's fast food sector declined by 2.7 percent relative to employment in the fast food sector elsewhere in the United States from September 2023 through September 2024. Adjusting for pre-AB 1228 trends increases this differential decline to 3.2 percent, while netting out the equivalent employment changes in non-minimum-wage-intensive industries further increases the decline. Our median estimate translates into a loss of 18,000 jobs in California's fast food sector relative to the counterfactual.</content>

    <title>Does Universal Occupational Licensing Recognition Improve Patient Access? Evidence from Healthcare Utilization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing state and regional physician labor supply has been an important policy issue in healthcare in the United States. One of the proposed solutions has been the universal licensing recognition (ULR), which allows out-of-state physicians to provide healthcare services without relicensing and increases the local labor supply of physicians. There has been no empirical analysis of the effect of such regulatory relaxation on the local labor supply and subsequent improvements of consumer welfare. In this study, we use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to investigate the effect of universal reciprocity of physician licenses on healthcare utilization, and use data from IPUMS-USA, IPUMS-CPS, and the Doctors and Clinicians National Downloadable File from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to examine the changes in the local labor supply of physicians through interstate migration and out-of-state practices. Our results show that adopting the ULR significantly raises the proportion of individuals accessing healthcare, particularly among older individuals, and reduces the proportion of individuals not getting healthcare services because of costs. We provide empirical evidence that these effects are from the universal reciprocity of physician licenses, instead of unknown factors related to the ULR. We also show that the positive effect of the ULR on healthcare utilization is closely related to the increase in out-of-state practitioners to include temporary and telehealth physicians, by showing no changes in interstate migration of physicians and an increase in out-of-state practices. The adoption of ULR may allow for a more efficient regional distribution of physicians and result in greater access to healthcare.</content>

    <title>Matching-Gift Incentives and Blood Donation: Linking Local and Global Altruism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a large-scale field experiment in Granada, Spain, to assess the motivating effect on blood donation of matching each attempt to donate with a charitable contribution pledge for children in developing countries. The intervention involved 344 blood drives and 21,888 participants. Compared to a control condition with no pledges, the pro-social incentives significantly increased blood donation rates by approximately 5% on average. Offering a day or a week’s worth of food for vulnerable populations led to the largest and most robust increases in donations, and repeated exposure to incentives had a reinforcing effect on subsequent donation behavior, especially for individuals who previously donated when incentivized. An auxiliary survey examining the perceived importance and motivational impact of food-related incentives corroborates our findings. Our results suggest that coordination between blood donation campaigns and humanitarian aid programs could enhance the blood supply at minimal additional cost. More broadly, policymakers and nonprofit organizations can align global and local altruism by linking humanitarian assistance with initiatives promoting civic engagement and public health.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does industrial concentration shape the life and death of cities? We identify settlements from historical maps of England and Wales (1790–1820), isolate exogenous variation in their late 19th-century size and industrial concentration, and estimate the causal impact of size and concentration on later dynamics. Industrial concentration has a negative effect on long-run productivity—independent of industry trends and consistent with cross-industry Jacobs externalities. A spatial model quantifies the role of fundamentals, industry trends, and Jacobs externalities in shaping industry-city dynamics and isolates a new, dynamic trade-off in the design of place-based policies.</content>

    <title>Government Monitoring of Health Care Quality: Evidence from the Nursing Home Sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In contracting out, monitoring is an important policy tool to extract information on firm quality and incentivize quality provision. This paper examines a central quality inspection of nursing homes, a sector with significant welfare implications but widespread public concerns about its quality of care. Using data on nursing homes across the US, we find that nursing homes exhibit strategic responses to the inspection. Nursing homes increase the quantity and quality of labor inputs, reduce admissions, increase temporary discharges, and improve patient care in response to the inspection. However, nearly all responses described above drop immediately once the inspection is completed. While inspection rating is unlikely to reflect nursing homes’ absolute quality given the strategic responses, using a quasi-experimental research design we find that inspection rating predicts nursing homes’ relative quality. Finally, we examine the effects of quality deficiency citations issued by the inspection on incentivizing nursing homes to improve quality of care, finding mixed impacts.</content>

    <title>Eurosclerosis at 40: Labor Market Institutions, Dynamism, and European Competitiveness</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores a repositioning of Europe’s labor market institutions as potential drivers of the transatlantic gap in macroeconomic performance. Institutional diagnoses were prominent in times of high European unemployment in the 1980-90s. But interest waned as joblessness fell—even though the decline was uneven, precarious work arrangements have grown, and labor markets remain largely unreformed (unlike product and financial markets). Yet, rigid labor market institutions might continue to matter because they can stifle labor market and business dynamism: Europeans switch jobs much less frequently, and restructuring is much rarer. Recent research argues that such immobility impedes wage and productivity growth. Moreover, this low dynamism might contribute to Europe’s specific underperformance in tech, R&amp;D, disruptive innovation, ICT adoption—where creative destruction requires fluid reallocation. This institutional labor market perspective on European competitiveness complements prevailing diagnoses focused on capital and product market fragmentation. Tight labor markets, lower unemployment, and shrinking labor supply might keep this nexus timely.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the impacts of migrants on the culture of their destinations. Migrants often assimilate to local social norms and practices, but they also tend to maintain their own culture. Sometimes, beyond preserving their culture, they influence their new neighbors. We propose a conceptual framework to understand when migrants shape culture at their destination—and how. We identify two key conditions for influence (ideological intensity and power structure) and three channels of influence (cultural spillovers, organizational mobilization, and political leverage). We combine insights from political economy, social psychology, and evolutionary approaches to illuminate pathways of influence in historical perspective. Our review offers a new perspective on the mechanisms of cultural transmission, using illustrative cases to characterize the various ways in which migrants shape culture in their destinations.</content>

    <title>Productivity Beliefs and Efficiency in Science</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a method to estimate producers’ productivity beliefs in settings where output quantities and input prices are unobservable, and we use it to evaluate allocative efficiency in the market for science. Our model of researchers’ labor supply shows that their willingness to pay for their two key inputs, funding and time, reveals their underlying productivity beliefs. We estimate the model’s parameters using data from a nationally representative survey of research-active professors from all major fields of science. We find that the distribution of research productivity is highly skewed. Using these estimates, we assess the market’s allocative efficiency by comparing actual input allocations to optimal allocations given various objectives. Overall, the market for science is moderately efficient at maximizing output and researchers’ utility: actual input levels are positively correlated with the optimal levels implied by the model. However, the wedge between researchers’ actual and optimal input levels is often significant and difficult to predict. Our estimates imply that total budgets would need to increase by roughly 40% under actual allocations in order to achieve the same growth in scientific output that we predict under alternative allocations of the current budget. Scaling to the population level, this equates to billions of dollars in funding — there are substantial gains from developing new ways of identifying and supporting productive scientists.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new rule-based linking method for historical Census records. We augment earlier algorithms based on name, age and place of birth (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2012, or “basic ABE”), with five matching characteristics – middle initial, county of residence, and spouse and parents’ names. Relative to basic ABE, ABE-Extra Information (“ABE-EI”) greatly increases match rates, improves accuracy and is similarly representative of the population on most attributes, with geographic mobility being one important exception. Relative to machine learning algorithms, ABE-EI has somewhat lower match rates, improved representativeness, and offers full replicability. We also create the first ABE-based links for women.</content>

    <title>The Geography of Innovative Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most U.S. innovation output originates from firms that operate R&amp;D facilities across multiple local markets. We study how this geographic structure influences aggregate innovation and growth, and whether it is socially optimal. First, we develop an endogenous growth model featuring multi-market innovative firms that generate knowledge spillovers to geographically proximate firms. In equilibrium, firms may operate in too few or too many local markets, depending on how sensitive are the local spillovers they generate to their local size. Second, to quantify these effects, we link the model to data on firms’ R&amp;D locations, patents, and citation networks. Using an event-study design, we show that firms’ spatial expansion increases spillovers to other firms and estimate how these spillovers depend on a firm's local footprint. Our estimates imply that U.S. innovative firms operate in too few markets relative to the social optimum. Third, using quantitative counterfactuals, we find that policies promoting broader spatial scope yield larger welfare gains than standard R&amp;D subsidies. Moreover, unlike R&amp;D subsidies, such policies can also reduce regional inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do investors choose the intensity of their due diligence, and how does that choice affect investment outcomes? Using cell phone signal data, we measure the duration of pre-investment meetings between venture capitalists (VCs) and startup employees. This measure captures one important component of VC due diligence. Less due diligence is associated with hotter deals and markets, busier investors, and greater distance, consistent with a theory of costly learning. Also consistent with that theory, less due diligence is associated with more volatile investment performance, as VCs allocate capital under greater uncertainty. Overall, VCs appear to trade off the costs of due diligence with its improvements to capital allocation.</content>

    <title>Carbon Rollercoaster: A Historical Analysis of Decarbonization in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents the evolution of US carbon emissions and discusses the main factors that contributed to the historical carbon emissions rollercoaster. We divide the discussion into four periods – up to 1920, 1920-1960, 1960-2005 and after 2005. For each period, we discuss the main drivers of national carbon emissions. We then discuss trends in carbon emissions in the electricity sector. Electricity sector emissions were initially very small, but would become the largest source of US carbon emissions over the period 1980-2015, and the largest contributor to decarbonization since 2007. In the final section, we distill lessons from the U.S. experience that may inform decarbonization strategies in developing economies.</content>

    <title>Greener on the Other Side: Inequity and Tax Compliance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments frequently use proxies for deservingness—tags—to implement progressive tax and transfer policies. These proxies are often imperfect, leading to misclassification and inequities among equally deserving individuals. This paper studies the efficiency effects of such misclassification in the context of the property tax system in Manaus, Brazil. We leverage quasi-experimental variation in inequity generated by the boundaries of geographic sectors used to compute tax liabilities and a large tax reform in a series of augmented boundary discontinuity designs. We find that inequities significantly reduce tax compliance. The elasticity of compliance with respect to inequity is between 0.12 and 0.25, accounting for half of the overall change in compliance at the boundaries. A simple model of presumptive property taxation shows how mistagging affects the optimal tax schedule, highlighting the opposite implications of responses to the level of taxation and to inequity for optimal tax progressivity. Interpreting our findings through the lens of the model implies that optimal progressivity is around 50% lower than it would be absent inequity responses. These results underscore the importance of inequity for public policy design, especially in contexts with low fiscal capacity.</content>

    <title>The Aggregate Welfare and Trade Implications of Contracting Frictions in Global Sourcing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much do contracting frictions between global firms and their suppliers impact country welfare and trade? We answer this by developing a model of global sourcing under partial contractibility, where firm-supplier relationships are exposed to a bilateral holdup problem. Sourcing decisions aggregate into a gravity equation for trade flows by organizational mode (intrafirm vs. arm’s length), which we take to structural estimation. We can then evaluate welfare changes with an extended Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) formula that incorporates these contracting frictions. Our counterfactual analysis reveals a sizeable average country welfare gain of 9.2% from eliminating contracting frictions in global sourcing. We further show how accounting for these frictions significantly reshapes quantitative assessments of the welfare gains from trade, including the stakes in a US-China decoupling scenario.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low-cost private schools have increased educational access in low-income countries, but frequent school closures lead to costly disruptions in children’s schooling. We provide experimental evidence from Pakistan that both school loans and educational products and services (EPS) are (a) commercially viable products and (b) substantially and similarly improve school survival rates. Moreover, loans decrease closure rates more for schools with larger initial enrollments and lower baseline test scores, while EPS show no such differential impact. These results demonstrate how financial and educational input constraints can significantly affect school survival while underscoring that the fungibility of entrepreneurial support matters.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between green innovation and the business cycle, revealing that while non-green innovation is procyclical, green innovation is countercyclical. This pattern holds unconditionally over the business cycle and conditional on economic shocks. Motivated by these findings, we develop a business cycle model with endogenous green and non-green innovation to explain their distinct cyclical behavior. The key mechanism operates through a ‘green is in the future’ channel: green patents are expected to generate higher profits in the future, making green patenting less sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations. In general equilibrium, this channel is reinforced, making green and non-green innovation effective substitutes. We provide direct evidence supporting the model mechanism using data on market-implied values of green and non-green patents.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do corporate control transactions discipline the labor force? Consistent with synergies, new disclosures of employee misconduct in the investment advisory industry drop by between 17 and 22 percent following mergers. Both targets and acquirers have better pre-merger misconduct records than the industry’s average firm and, within the subsample of merging firms, there is assortative matching on misconduct. Merger events facilitate further reductions in misconduct through separations of target firm employees with high misconduct. Many of these employees remain in the industry, suggesting that consolidation plays an important role in the redistribution of misconduct across firms.</content>

    <title>How Do Tax Incentives Influence Employer Decisions to Offer Retirement Benefits?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, policy makers have adopted many measures to incentivize the establishment of employer-sponsored retirement plans (ESRPs). One such measure – implemented in the early 2000s and made more generous in recent years – allows smaller firms that establish an ESRP to claim a tax credit to offset part of their costs during the initial years. We examine firm take-up of this credit. We find that only 1 percent (pre-policy expansion) to 5.5 percent (post-policy expansion) of apparently eligible firms claim the credit. We document heterogeneity in credit take-up rates by industry, firm owner education, and use of tax preparation services. We also document evidence of “tax preparer learning,” whereby take-up among a tax preparer’s clients increases after that preparer files their first credit. Finally, we document that most firms only claim the credit for one year despite being eligible to do so for up to three years.</content>

    <title>Capital Budgeting For EPS Maximizers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To increase a company’s earnings, a project must generate enough income next year to pay for its own financing. Hence, a manager who wants to maximize her EPS (earnings per share) should only invest in accretive projects that have income yields above the firm’s cheapest financing option. This is the max EPS analog to the positive-NPV (net present value) rule. Maximizing EPS ≠ minimizing investment. EPS maximizers use real investment to arbitrage between asset and capital markets. This framework rationalizes the pervasive use of IRRs (internal rates of return) and payback periods. An IRR effectively measures how accretive a project will be. A payback period expresses the project’s income yield as a multiple. Empirically, a simple max EPS model explains M&amp;A payment method and investment-cash flow sensitivity. It also predicts which firms have higher proportions of convertible debt and capitalized interest expense.</content>

    <title>Tax Reform and the Laffer Curve</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper evaluates Laffer curves produced by reforms to nonlinear income taxes, focusing on individual taxpayers. A reform puts a taxpayer on the “wrong” side of the Laffer curve if it increases their tax burden while reducing tax payments. There always exist potential reforms with this property – and in particular, tax increases restricted to high-income taxpayers are guaranteed to consign some to the wrong side of the Laffer curve. The original design of the 2024 Australian tax reform would have put 15% of the taxpaying population on the wrong side of the Laffer curve, though subsequent modifications reduced this to 5%. Standard tax progressivity measures that ignore the endogeneity of taxable income generally understate the redistributive impact of progressive tax reforms.</content>

    <title>Targeting Distributional Impacts in the Presence of Behavioral Responses: Lessons from Maritime Emissions Regulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Targeting distributional impacts is gaining importance in the design of environmental policy. To achieve this, policy makers are adopting advances in air transport models to predict the benefits of air emissions regulation. These models offer policy makers accuracy in the spatial distribution of ambient air quality improvements for a given emissions reduction, but do not take into account behavioral responses to environmental policies. We consider how the failure to account for behavioral responses when making policy predictions may have important implications for the ultimate distributional impact of such policies. We compare the distributional impacts of maritime emission regulation predicted from the policy maker's air transport model to the realized distributional impacts. We then decompose the prediction error from two components: model error, whereby the predictions of air transport models fail to account for behavioral responses of polluting firms, and sorting error, whereby the targeted population migrates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The integration of algorithmic trading with reinforcement learning, termed AI-powered trading, is transforming financial markets. Alongside the benefits, it raises concerns for collusion. This study first develops a model to explore the possibility of collusion among informed speculators in a theoretical environment. We then conduct simulation experiments, replacing the speculators in the model with informed AI speculators who trade based on reinforcement-learning algorithms. We show that they autonomously sustain collusive supra-competitive profits without agreement, communication, or intent. Such collusion undermines competition and market efficiency. We demonstrate that two separate mechanisms are underlying this collusion and characterize when each one arises.</content>

    <title>Credit Access in the United States</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct new population-level linked administrative data to study households' access to credit in the United States. These data reveal large differences in credit access by race, class, and hometown. By age 25, Black individuals, those who grew up in low-income families, and those who grew up in certain areas (including the Southeast and Appalachia) have significantly lower credit scores than other groups. Consistent with lower scores generating credit constraints, these individuals have smaller balances, more credit inquiries, higher credit card utilization rates, and greater use of alternative higher-cost forms of credit. Tests for alternative definitions of algorithmic bias in credit scores yield results in opposite directions. From a calibration perspective, group-level differences in credit scores understate differences in delinquency: conditional on a given credit score, Black individuals and those from low-income families fall delinquent at relatively higher rates. From a balance perspective, these groups receive lower credit scores even when comparing those with the same future repayment behavior. Addressing both of these biases and expanding credit access to groups with lower credit scores requires addressing group-level differences in delinquency rates. These delinquencies emerge soon after individuals access credit in their early twenties, often due to missed payments on credit cards, student loans, and other bills. Comprehensive measures of individuals' income profiles, income volatility, and observed wealth explain only a small portion of these repayment gaps. In contrast, we find that the large variation in repayment across hometowns mostly reflects the causal effect of childhood exposure to these places. Places that promote upward income mobility also promote repayment and expand credit access even conditional on income, suggesting that common place-level factors may drive behaviors in both credit and labor markets. We discuss suggestive evidence for several mechanisms that drive our results, including the role of social and cultural capital. We conclude that gaps in credit access by race, class, and hometown have roots in childhood environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U.S. President Trump’s emphasis on ‘tariff reciprocity’ has focused public attention on relative height of tariffs as a measure of fairness in trade relations. The importweighted average tariff subsequently used by USTR to rank how protectionist are trading partners is atheoretic and misleading for this purpose. We propose and implement a theory-consistent tariff index that combines thousands of tariff rates into an import volume equivalent uniform tariff. The index: (i) is consistent with the WTO principle that trade relations should aim at reciprocal exchange of market access, and (ii) decomposes neatly into each country’s buyer and seller incidence of tariffs.</content>

    <title>Beyond Bonferroni: Hierarchical Multiple Testing in Empirical Research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical research in the social and medical sciences frequently involves testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, increasing the risk of false positives due to chance. Classical multiple testing procedures, such as the Bonferroni correction, control the family-wise error rate (FWER) but tend to be overly conservative, reducing statistical power. Stepwise alternatives like the Holm and Hochberg procedures offer improved power while maintaining error control under certain dependence structures. However, these standard approaches typically ignore hierarchical relationships among hypotheses—structures that are common in settings such as clinical trials and program evaluations, where outcomes are often logically or causally linked. Hierarchical multiple testing procedures—including fixed sequence, fallback, and gatekeeping methods—explicitly incorporate these relationships, providing more powerful and interpretable frameworks for inference. This paper reviews key hierarchical methods, compares their statistical properties and practical trade-offs, and discusses implications for applied empirical research.</content>

    <title>Looking Backward: Long-Term Religious Service Attendance in 66 Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The attendance rate at religious services is an important variable for the sociology and economics of religion, but long-term and global data are scarce. Retrospective questions from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) allow the construction of rates of religious-service attendance back as far as the 1920s in 66 countries, half from the “Global South.”  A number of checks support the reliability of the retrospective information. One exercise demonstrates the consistency between retrospective and contemporaneous survey data when the two overlap. Another procedure shows that the retrospective values are similar when generated from individual ISSP surveys for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018; that is, there is no clear dependence of memory on the number of years of recall. The new data document a century-long “Great Religious Divergence” between North and South. We use the data to carry out event studies for effects on religious-service attendance of two major events.  Vatican II, in 1962-1965, triggered a decline in worldwide Catholic attendance relative to that in other denominations. In contrast, the endings of Communism in the early 1990s did not systematically affect religious-service attendance. Finally, in a large sample, religious-service attendance responds positively to wars and depressions.</content>

    <title>The Illusion of Time: Gender Gaps in Job Search and Employment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In countries with low female employment, college educated women often transition directly from education to homemaking. Does this reflect informed, forward-looking choices or unanticipated constraints? We study this question in Pakistan, where two-thirds of college-educated women remain out of the labor force. Tracking 2,400 students from two major universities, we document labor market expectations before graduation, and realized outcomes in the year that follows. Men and women have similar work aspirations, apply at similar times and rates, and receive comparable numbers of job offers, but women are more likely to reject them. As a result, a 27 pp employment gap emerges within six months. The gap stems largely from timing: for women, there is a critical window, immediately post-graduation, during which job search is associated with much higher chances of employment. There is no such window for men. To test whether this relationship is causal—and anticipated—we randomize a modest incentive to apply early. By shifting students’ search into the critical early window, the intervention raises women’s employment by ~ 20%, but leaves men’s unaffected, closing a third of the gender employment gap. Treatment effects are driven by women who underestimate how quickly marriage market activities arise, revealing an “illusion of time.”</content>

    <title>Frontline Leadership: Evidence from American Civil War Captains</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents new evidence on the critical role of lower-level organizational leaders. Unlike top managers, frontline leaders are essential for implementing organizational strategies by maintaining team cohesion when shirking is profitable for workers. We study this in the context of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, using data on 2.2 million soldiers and tracking captains and their 100-soldier companies at weekly frequency throughout the conflict. We estimate leader fixed effects during non-combat weeks to measure leadership quality in a leader value-added framework. We validate this measure by showing that captains were not assigned based on prior unit performance or observable pre-war characteristics. High-quality leaders earned more after the war, but not before, and were more frequently recognized as good leaders in their postwar biographies. Daily event-study estimates around major battles show that better captains significantly reduced desertions in combat. Exploiting quasi-random leader turnover, we find evidence that this effect is causal. Using digitized battle maps, we rule out risk aversion as a mechanism and find instead that better leaders had higher mortality rates, consistent with a leading-by-example explanation. We also document modest learning-by-doing effects. These findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of frontline leadership, where direct supervision and interpersonal influence are strongest.</content>

    <title>The Racial Penalty in Job Ladder Transitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of job transitions and firm pay policies in the Black-White earnings gap in the US. We use administrative data for the universe of employer-employee matches from 2005-2019 to analyze worker mobility in a general but tractable framework, which allows for firm effects that depend on workers’ job history. Using differences in average pay between origin and destination firms as the treatment intensity of a job move, we analyze transitions up and down the job ladder and estimate race-specific passthrough rates of average firm pay into a mover’s own earnings. First, we find race-specific asymmetry around the direction of the move, whereby losses experienced in downward transitions are meaningfully larger than gains from upward transitions with a similar treatment intensity. For a $1 earnings increase in transitions up the job ladder, earnings passthroughs in transitions down the job ladder impose an earnings loss of $1.25 among White workers and $1.50 among Black workers. Second, we uncover career setbacks as a novel pathway in the evolution of racial earnings gaps. In transitions down the job ladder, Black workers lose an additional $0.24 for every $1 decrease in White workers’ earnings, a finding which prevails across sex and age. This “racial penalty” is not driven by differential pay, as it is completely absent when Black and White workers move between the same firm pairs. Instead, the penalty is due to differential sorting following career setbacks, so that Black workers regain employment in “worse” jobs, with strong evidence for racial differences in access to short-run liquidity as a mechanism. Overall, our findings offer a robust and computationally simple framework for modeling earnings determination processes and have implications for safety-net policies in the American labor market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While many socialist countries suffered from harsh economic crises, studying their impacts on economic and political attitudes is challenging because of the scarcity of reliable data in nondemocratic contexts. We study a democratic socialist setting where we have ample information on such attitudes: the Israeli kibbutzim. Exploiting an economic crisis that hit some kibbutzim more than others, we find that the crisis led to reduced support for leftist political parties. This effect persisted for over 20 years after the crisis had ended. We document that the electoral movement was rooted in a rightward shift in economic attitudes, suggesting that economic crises may undermine socialist regimes by silently changing attitudes toward them. In our unique setting, we can also study recovery mechanisms from the crisis. First, we find that while a sharp debt relief arrangement restored trust in the leadership, it did not reverse the impact of the crisis on economic attitudes. Second, as part of their efforts to recover from the crisis, kibbutzim liberalized their labor markets. Analyzing the staggered shift away from equal sharing to market-based wages, we find that this labor market liberalization led kibbutz members to move further rightward in their political voting and economic attitudes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of temperature during the growing season on household diets in the subsequent year in rural India, a setting with a high prevalence of small family farms. High growing season temperatures reduce crop yields, which would presumably reduce incomes and home-grown food for consumption. However, household adaptation could mitigate how the reductions in yields affect diets. We find that heat increases the number of strongly undernourished households in the subsequent year, as measured by the consumption of calories, iron, zinc, thiamine, and niacin. We also find suggestive evidence that households adapt to heat-induced losses of home-grown crops by purchasing more food.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an experimental framework to identify the belief-based and taste-based drivers of demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) partnerships. Our study implements two symmetric experiments with real startup founders and venture capital (VC) investors, who evaluate hypothetical profiles under the understanding that their responses will inform an algorithm generating personalized real-world matches. We find a significant ESG penalty: profiles randomly labeled with ESG attributes receive substantially lower collaboration interest from both founders and VCs. This penalty is primarily driven by negative performance beliefs—ESG-labeled profiles are perceived as less profitable and less accessible. To isolate taste-based preferences, we further implement a willingness-to-pay experiment in which participants may forgo part of a lottery reward to receive additional match recommendations of comparable quality. Participants randomly offered ESG-oriented recommendations are now significantly more likely to pay, revealing a latent preference for ESG once performance concerns are held constant. These findings highlight a tension between financial returns and personal values: in current market conditions, concerns about profitability obscure an underlying taste for ESG.</content>

    <title>A Trade-off Between Monetary Policy Transmission and Systemic Risk in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how interbank wholesale funding shapes the transmission of interest-rate-based monetary policy in China and contributes to systemic risk. Using a bank-level quarterly panel dataset and an estimated policy rule for the 7-day repo rate, we find that access to wholesale funding amplifies the transmission of monetary policy easing to lending by non-state banks, but also heightens their vulnerability to systemic risk during economic downturns. Since 2018, non-state banks with greater reliance on wholesale funding have experienced larger increases in expected capital shortfalls. To interpret these findings, we develop a structural model that incorporates a dual-track interest rate system and a segmented deposit market. The model quantifies the role of a liquidity reallocation channel from state to non-state banks and reveals a macroprudential trade-off: tighter regulation of wholesale funding weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy but mitigates systemic risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses longitudinal data to study the benefits of participation in scholastic athletics starting with high school participation and continuing with college athletics, including the benefits of intramural athletics. We study the impact of participation on a number of important life outcomes, including graduation from high school and college and wages after schooling is completed. Controlling for rich measures of cognitive and personality skills and social background, we find substantial benefits at all levels. Participation in athletics promotes social mobility for disadvantaged and minority students.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper empirically analyzes the effects of mergers between complementary firms on competition and pricing. As these non-horizontal mergers have become more common, there is increasing interest in evaluating both potential efficiencies such as eliminating double marginalization and potential anticompetitive effects such as foreclosure and recapture. The mergers we study – hospital acquisitions of physician practices – have reshaped the $1 trillion US physician industry, nearly doubling the share of physicians working for hospitals between 2008 and 2016. We combine novel data and machine learning algorithms to identify a large number of integration events, spanning a wide range of markets with different competitive circumstances. We merge the integration events with claims data from a large national insurer to study their effects on prices. Focusing on childbirths, the most ubiquitous admission among the privately insured, we find that, on average, these mergers led to price increases for hospitals and physicians of 3.3% and 15.1%, respectively, with no discernible effects on quality measures. Using demand estimation to characterize substitution patterns for both physicians and hospitals, we construct tests that demonstrate price increases are larger among transactions with greater scope for foreclosure and recapture. Our estimates suggest that the costs of these mergers of hospitals and physicians have been substantial, and our mechanism tests offer guidance in predicting where the anticompetitive effects of non-horizontal mergers are likely to be strongest.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Parenting and Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a large, randomized cash transfer on parental behaviors, investment in children, children's social, behavioral, and educational outcomes, and pregnancy and childbearing. We find that parents who were randomly selected to receive a $1,000 per month unconditional cash transfer for three years spent more on their children each month and reported better parenting behaviors (such as supervising their children more closely) compared to those randomized to receive $50 per month over the same period. However, possibly due to this closer monitoring, parents in the treatment group also reported that their child was experiencing more developmental difficulties and stress. Parents with the lowest incomes at baseline experienced the largest improvements in parenting; among these parents, the transfer also increased the use and quality of non-parental child care. The transfer did not have a meaningful effect on most educational outcomes measured in school administrative records, nor did it affect characteristics of the home environment, child food security, exposure to homelessness, or parental satisfaction. Although treated families were more likely to move, we did not detect changes in most measures of neighborhood quality, though proximity to child-focused amenities such as daycares appeared to increase in the treatment group relative to the control group. The transfer did not affect childbearing, pregnancy, or outcomes related to contraception. While the transfer reduced parents' stress and mental distress in the first year of the program, these effects were short-lived and dissipated by the second year of the transfer, analogous to what was documented previously in the full population of participants.</content>

    <title>International Power</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An interconnected world increases economic efficiency while giving certain countries leverage over others. We aim to describe and understand international power stemming from trade. Using an illustrative model of trade with possibilities of bilateral disputes and ex-post hold-ups, we highlight that bilateral asymmetry in import dependence can be a source of coercive power towards one another. We construct the model-implied measure of international power—asymmetric bilateral import dependence, weighted inversely by sectoral trade elasticities — across country pairs over the past 20 years. Combining this measure with comprehensive data on bilateral engagement events and a high-frequency measure of bilateral geopolitical relationships, we examine the consequences and strategic causes of international power. We show two main empirical results. First, increases in international power between countries — which raise the credibility of threats of trade disruptions — induce more bilateral engagement and negotiations. Second, worsened geopolitical relationships — in anticipation of future disputes — prompt countries to build up greater international power through adjusting trade activities.</content>
