    <title>Economic Development and the Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic development relies on and transforms the environment. The transformation is evident in the poor environmental quality in many developing countries. For example, air quality in Southeast Asia is three times worse than in the United States, in sub-Saharan Africa four times worse and in South Asia more than six times worse. We model how environmental quality affects health, productivity and well-being and how individuals privately adapt to environmental hazards. We also model how collective action and formal regulation contribute to environmental quality. We draw three main findings from a review of empirical research on these mechanisms. First, individual adaptation to environmental hazards is both inadequate as a remedy and inefficiently low. Second, collective action, without the state, to manage resources or address externalities has been outstripped by the scale of environmental problems. Third, state action through formal regulation works better than it looks. Many formal regulations are coarse, poorly targeted and inefficient, but nonetheless yield benefits in excess of their costs.</content>

    <title>War and Democratic Backsliding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first global, long-run evidence on how war reshapes democratic institutions. Using data on all conflicts since 1948, we show that the onset of conflict causes a large and persistent decline in democracy: institutions weaken immediately, continue to erode for nearly a decade, and do not recover. Yet this deterioration is highly selective. It appears only in first-time conflicts, intrastate wars, highly fractionalized societies, and conflicts that governments win. The decline operates through political channels – media censorship, judicial purges, curtailed civil liberties, irregular leadership turnover, and constitutional suspensions - rather than through any functional requirement of war-making. Autocratization does not increase the probability of victory, and institutional instability reduces it. Taken together, the findings show that war does not require autocracy; it enables executives to expand their authority and implement institutional changes that would be difficult to enact in peacetime.</content>

    <title>Does Generative AI Crowd Out Human Creators? Evidence from Pixiv</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive dataset of posts from a major platform for anime- and manga-style artwork, we study the impact of the launch of a prominent text-to-image generative AI. Focusing on the majority of incumbent creators who do not adopt AI as a primary tool, we show that the AI launch led to a significant decline in post uploads by illustrators, whereas comic artists were less affected, reflecting the need for tight stylistic alignment across sequential images in comics. We present empirical evidence for two underlying mechanisms. First, illustration posts experience a loss of viewer attention, measured by bookmarks, following the AI launch, which can significantly harm creators’ business models. Second, direct competition from AI-generated content plays an important role: illustrators working on intellectual properties (IPs, such as Pokémon) that are more heavily invaded by AI reduce their uploads disproportionately more. We further examine creators’ responses and show that illustrators with greater exposure to AI avoid using tags favored by AI-generated content after the AI launch and broaden the range of IPs they work on, consistent with a risk-hedging response to AI invasion.</content>

    <title>The Response of Debtors to Rate Changes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How borrowers respond to future changes in the interest rate on their debt matters for the transmission of monetary policy and for household financial stability. Combining bank data, a letter RCT, and a survey, we study this question in the context of the German mortgage market, where since 2022 borrowers have faced high interest rates when their rate fixation period ends. We find that borrower actions substantially reduce the impact of higher rates on monthly payments. Survey responses corroborate high informedness and a strong propensity to prepare for rate changes. The letter intervention does not affect rate beliefs but increases awareness of available options and refinancing among borrowers close to expiration of their rate fixation.</content>

    <title>Industrial Activity, State Capacity, and Deforestation: Evidence from Brazil</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does industrial activity drive deforestation and land degradation, and can limited state capacity be overcome to decouple economic growth from environmental harm? We examine these questions in the context of slaughterhouse plant openings in Brazil from 1994 to 2019. Guided by a simple conceptual framework and using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that plant openings increase livestock production while reducing forest cover and degrading pastureland. However, following the introduction of legally enforceable, incentive-compatible agreements between slaughterhouses and federal prosecutors—which penalize purchases of livestock from illegally deforested areas but act as a green certification mechanism—plant openings increase productivity without driving deforestation. Our findings suggest that tying firm performance to environmental goals through market-aligned legal mechanisms can generate economic and environmental gains at low cost to the government.</content>

    <title>A Macroeconomic Perspective on Stock Market Valuation Ratios</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional valuation metrics for the U.S. stock market based on a comparison of the aggregate market value of U.S. corporations to measures of dividends, earnings, output, and the replacement cost of measured capital have been above historical norms for the past 25–30 years. Will they return to their historical means? We use macroeconomic data to argue that the observed decline in labor’s share of corporate output in conjunction with relatively weak corporate investment mechanically generates a persistent rise in the ratio of corporate valuation relative to corporate earnings, even absent any changes in expected returns or growth rates.</content>

    <title>A Few Bad Apples? Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.</content>

    <title>Effective and Scalable Programs to Facilitate Labor Market Transitions for Women in Technology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate two interventions facilitating technology-sector transitions for women in Poland: Mentoring, focused on expanding professional networks, and Challenges, focused on building credible skill signals. Randomizing oversubscribed admissions, we find both programs substantially increase technology employment at twelve months-by 15 percentage points for Mentoring and 11 p.p. for Challenges. The distinct mechanisms through which the programs operate translate to heterogeneous treatment effects across geography, career stage, and baseline credentials. These differential effects create scope for improved allocation: algorithmic targeting across programs outperforms random assignment by 86% and outperforms experts' selection into Mentoring by 11%.</content>

    <title>Scaling Sustainable Investing in Emerging and Developing Economies: Frictions and Opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mobilizing private capital at scale is critical for financing sustainable development, particularly in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), where capital is most needed. We conduct a global survey of senior investment decision-makers across a broad spectrum of capital providers, including asset managers, pension and sovereign wealth funds, development finance institutions, philanthropic investors, and others. The survey provides novel evidence on investors’ risk-return expectations, risk perceptions, and investment practices in EMDEs and in blended finance structures. We document four main findings. First, conditional on investor type, return expectations in EMDEs are comparable to those in developed markets, suggesting that categorical exclusions of EMDE assets might be inefficient. Second, investors’ dominant risk perceptions—particularly currency and political risks—are poorly aligned with the de-risking tools commonly employed in blended finance. Third, prevailing approaches to evaluating blended finance rely on both input- and outcome-based metrics, yet with limited measurement of financial and impact additionality. Fourth, our results highlight organizational and informational frictions, rather than unattractive financial fundamentals, as key barriers to scaling sustainable investing in EMDEs.</content>

    <title>Behavioral Economics of AI: LLM Biases and Corrections</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), exhibit systematic behavioral biases in economic and financial decisions? If so, how can these biases be mitigated? Drawing on the cognitive psychology and experimental economics literatures, we conduct the most comprehensive set of experiments to date—originally designed to document human biases—on prominent LLM families across model versions and  scales. We document systematic patterns in LLM behavior. In preference-based tasks, responses become more human-like as models become more advanced or larger, while in belief-based tasks, advanced large-scale models frequently generate rational responses. Prompting LLMs to make rational decisions reduces biases.</content>

    <title>The United States as an Active Industrial Policy Nation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document and characterize a new history of U.S. federal-level industrial policies by scanning all 12,167 Congressional Acts and 6,030 Presidential Orders from 1973 through 2022. We find several interesting patterns. First, contrary to a common perception, the United States has always been an active industrial policy nation throughout the period, regardless of which party is in power, with 5.4 laws and 3.4 Presidential Orders per year on average containing new industrial policies. Second, we identify roughly 300% more instances of industrial policies than those in the Global Trade Alert (GTA) database during 2008-2022, despite using essentially the same definition. Third, industrial policies in practice are as likely to be justified by national security as by economic competitiveness. Fourth, many U.S. industrial policies incorporate design features that help mitigate potential drawbacks, such as explicit expiration dates and pilot programs for emerging technologies. Finally, based on stock market reactions and firm performance, the identified policies are recognized as economically significant in shifting resource allocations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage Becker’s time allocation theory to examine consumer demand and market competition for time-intensive goods. The Beckerian model predicts higher diversion ratios for goods with substantial time shares and those with high time costs relative to monetary prices. Applying this model to data from two field experiments, we analyze demand for Facebook and Instagram, focusing on substitution patterns across online activities and offline time use. Our findings indicate that users exhibit low elasticity to ad load, the primary user cost, and that time shares and time costs significantly influence diversion ratios. We explore the implications for user costs and benefits on these platforms and assess the potential impact of a Federal Trade Commission-proposed de-merger of Facebook and Instagram.</content>

    <title>The Twenty-four Hour Economy or Rolled-up Sidewalks: Trends in Work Timing and Their Causes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate nearly steady trends from 1973-2023 in the U.S. in the timing of when people work for pay, away from evening and night hours toward “usual” daytime hours. The trend is related to changes in rising educational attainment, to increased real incomes, and the increased wage premium for undesirable work times—evenings and nights—that we document. The trend exists in all major industries except retail, in which changes in technology biased work away from daytime hours. The trend was accelerated by the sharp increase in telework that occurred after the Covid pandemic, an increase that was especially concentrated during daytime hours. While we observe the same phenomenon in France from 1966 to 2010, we do not in the U.K. from 1974-2015, arguably because of the very sharp decline in unionization in the U.K. and the changes in retailing.</content>

    <title>Salience and the Elasticity of Taxable Income: Evidence from Top-bracket Tax Reforms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate heterogeneous responses to top-bracket tax reforms using a triple-difference design that exploits variation in tax rate changes and the thresholds at which they apply. This strategy identifies behavioral responses even in the presence of unobservable shocks to the income distribution. Higher-income taxpayers respond more to top-rate changes, but our results indicate that this reflects the salience of the reforms—the larger mechanical change in average tax rates at higher incomes—rather than heterogeneity in substitution elasticities. We discuss implications for the revenue and distributional effects of top-bracket tax reforms.</content>

    <title>No Taxation Without Administration: Bringing The State Back Into The Public Finance Of Developing Countries</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The empirical economics literature on taxation in developing countries has centered on the importance of third-party information for enforcement. Yet, while surely a long-run objective, leveraging such information remains out of reach in many developing countries due to largely informal economies and low state capacity. This article examines an emerging complementary literature focused on strengthening the 'sinews' of state capacity: tax administration. We argue that reforms to the organizational structure, personnel management, and task management of tax authorities have potential to raise tax capacity in developing countries. We also argue that efforts to improve the state's legitimacy – popular acceptance of its right to tax – can increase capacity and may complement investments in tax administration. Our approach bridges a long-standing divide between how scholars in public finance and political economy approach tax capacity building in developing countries.</content>

    <title>Global Trade, Tariff Uncertainty and the U.S. Dollar</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how tariff uncertainty affects exchange rates, motivated by the U.S. dollar’s depreciation after the 2025 tariff announcements. Standard macro-trade models predict that unilateral tariffs appreciate the implementing country’s currency, but we show this result can be overturned by policy uncertainty. We build a two-country general equilibrium model with risk-averse agents and segmented financial markets, where tariff volatility enters uncovered interest parity through a risk-premium wedge. Higher tariff uncertainty increases precautionary savings and risk premia, leading to immediate currency depreciation even as tariffs rise. Quantitatively, the model replicates the size and timing of the observed dollar depreciation episode dynamics.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose rational disagreement as a formal framework for analyzing seemingly irrational behavior that can persist despite the wide availability of objective information in a steady-state. Agents are rational in that they correctly anticipate the distribution of aggregate outcomes, yet disagree about which specific individuals perform better than others. Notably, the subjective belief of any individual may be objectively correct.
We illustrate the key concepts with a simple entry game. We show how unordered individual outcome distributions can be identified solely from aggregate statistics. We then characterize the resulting game, define its Nash equilibria, and develop a statistical test for the null hypothesis of agreement. Finally, we situate our framework within the broader literature on Bayesian games, behavioral biases, and the rational expectations hypothesis.</content>

    <title>The Contribution of College Majors to Gender and Racial Earnings Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender and racial/ethnic gaps in labor market earnings remain large, even among college-goers. Cross-gender and race/ethnic differences in choice of and returns to college major are potentially important contributors. Following Texas public high school graduates for up to 20 years through college and the labor market, we assess gender and racial differences in college major choices and the consequences of these choices. Women and underrepresented minorities are less likely than men, Whites, and Asians to major in high earning fields like business, economics, engineering, and computer science, however we also show that they experience lower returns to these majors. Differences in major-specific returns relative to liberal arts explain about one quarter of the gender, White-Black, and White-Hispanic (but not White-Asian) earnings gaps among four-year college students and become larger contributors to earnings gaps than differential major distributions as workers age. We present suggestive evidence that differences in occupation choices within field are a key driver of the differences in returns across groups. The work shines light on the roles that college major choice and returns by gender and race contribute to inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter presents a tractable framework for the study of technology adoption and diffusion in the context of economic development. Firms in countries behind the world technology frontier can rapidly adopt new techniques from the world frontier. Lower absorptive capacity (because of weak education systems, poor management practices, or barriers to technology adoption), institutional distortions, mismatch between frontier technologies and the needs of firms in the country (i.e., “inappropriate technology”), and credit market frictions slow down technology adoption and cause the economy in question to have a greater distance to the frontier and thus lower income per capita—although the long-run growth rate of the country still remains equal to that of the frontier. This framework is extended to study the choice between innovation and imitation, as well as the role of selection for higher-productivity and higher-absorptive capacity firms during the process of economic development. We illustrate the main comparative statics of our framework with a number of correlations based on cross-country and firm-level data. The tractability of the framework makes it amenable to a range of additional extensions.</content>

    <title>Senior Migration, Local Economic Development and Spatial Concentration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that migration flows upon retirement are predominantly from richer, more urban to poorer, more rural regions. In theory, the local economic implications of senior in-migration are ambiguous, while empirically there is little existing evidence on whether attracting mobile seniors can be an effective tool to promote economic development among lagging regions. We combine a unique collection of microdata from France with a new empirical strategy to fill this gap. We find that senior inflows have significant positive effects on the local economy over the course of a decade, including increases in the working-age population, total employment, GDP, average incomes, fiscal revenues and housing construction. These effects are particularly pronounced among initially poorer regions. They are accompanied by an increase in the share of services in the local economy, driven by employment growth in health, food services and retail sectors. Combining these estimates with observed region-to-region net migration flows, we find that mobile seniors have become a significant force for reducing the concentration of employment and GDP across regions.</content>

    <title>Missing Black Men? The Impact of Non-Reporting on Estimates of Labor Market Outcomes for Black Men</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adult Black men persistently do not report to household-based surveys, with demographers estimating non-reporting rates of 7-14% from 1970-2020. We derive a method to account for incomplete data and show that non-reporting rates are up to 5.5 percentage points (pp) larger than prior estimates, with significant heterogeneity by year. We then show that Black men at risk of incarceration drive non-reporting. We use state-year variation in incarceration rates to estimate that 35-83% of the incarcerated population would have been non-reporting if not incarcerated. Adjusting for previously uncorrected non-reporting shows that the Black-white gap in high-school completion is 20-39% (3.0-5.9 pp) larger, college attendance is 8-18% (3.1-6.1 pp) larger, and earnings is 10-20% (2.8-5.7 pp) larger. In contrast, the gap in  employment is 4-8% (0.6-1.6 pp) smaller than previously thought.</content>

    <title>Psychology and Development: Applications from Cognitive and Social Psychology</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We outline a research agenda for behavioral development economics that seeks to understand the role of psychological channels in: (i) impeding individuals' ability to climb out of poverty, and (ii) shaping the organization of production, functioning of markets, and role of informal institutions in developing countries.  We apply a missing markets lens to rationalize why tools, products and services that help individuals overcome their biases will be under-supplied by the market and why behavioral biases can have large impacts in steady state, even among highly experienced agents. We argue that these biases are especially likely to matter for the field of development because core features of poverty---proximity to subsistence, high volatility,  market failures,  weak formal institutions, and reliance on social ties---amplify the impact of psychological constraints. We organize our review around a core set of psychological constructs: self-control, cognitive constraints, self-beliefs, mental health, and social norms. For each construct, we highlight places where there is only a proof of concept versus evidence of meaningful impacts, and the resultant implications for future research. We also highlight where social capital can be deployed to mitigate the impacts of missing markets. The field research to date has only begun to scratch the surface in document how psychological mechanisms affect behavior and decision-making, and substantial scope remains for future work to determine whether these constraints play a first-order role in shaping poverty.</content>

    <title>Understanding Latin America’s Fertility Decline: Age, Education, and Cohort Dynamics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the sharp decline in fertility across Latin America using both period and cohort measures. Combining Vital Statistics, Census microdata, and UN population data, we decompose changes in fertility by age, education, and joint age–education groups. We show that the decline in period fertility between 2000 and 2022 is driven primarily by reductions in within-group birth rates rather than by changes in population composition, with the largest contributions coming from younger and less-educated women. Comparing the cohort born in the mid 1950s and the one born in the mid 1970s, we find that the decline in completed fertility reflects not only delayed childbearing but also substantial reductions in the average number of children per woman. This is driven primarily by lower fertility among mothers rather than by rising childlessness. Our findings provide new evidence on the nature of Latin America’s transition to below-replacement fertility and highlight several open questions for future research.</content>

    <title>Speculative Growth and the AI "Bubble"</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;AI technology can generate speculative-growth equilibria. These are rational but fragile: elevated valuations support rapid capital accumulation, yet persist only as long as beliefs remain coordinated. Because AI capital is labor-like, it expands effective labor and dampens the normal decline in the marginal product of capital as the capital stock grows. The gains from this expansion accrue disproportionately to capitalists, whose saving rate rises with wealth, raising aggregate saving.  Building on Caballero et al (2006), I show that these features generate a funding feedback—rising capitalist wealth lowers the required return—that can produce multiple equilibria. With intermediate adjustment costs, elevated valuations are the mechanism that sustains a transition toward a high-capital equilibrium; a loss of confidence can precipitate a self-fulfilling crash and reversal.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The energy transition away from fossil fuels toward alternative energy sources will, like every significant economic transition, disrupt existing economic relationships and markets. Disruption in the labor market is of particular concern due to the distributional and political importance of energy jobs and the potential concentration of risks on workers in carbon-intensive sectors and regions that are particularly reliant on fossil-fuel industries. We look at modeling the labor implications of the energy transition. We outline a conceptual framework for analyzing the labor-market risks, focusing on obstacles to labor-market adjustments during the transition. We then review empirical research on such barriers to labor-market adjustments, with a focus on evidence that can inform modeling efforts. We also survey the literature on ex-ante modeling of the effects of the energy transition on labor markets, identifying both the challenges and opportunities for new research in this field.</content>

    <title>Financial Crises: History, Theory and New Insights</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review essay discusses the history, causes and consequences of financial crises. In recent years scholars have assembled new sources of data and utilized new empirical designs to analyze crises, shedding light on old questions and producing new insights. This essay highlights those new insights, and uses the historical record of crises in the United States to put those insights into perspective. I begin with a discussion of the defining characteristics of financial crises and their evolution, both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. I then revisit the chronology of crises in the U.S. since 1870. Data on bank failure rates and large-bank equity losses suggest that some panics were not full-blown financial crises, and also identify episodes when no panic occurred that could potentially be considered crises. I then turn to two categories of theoretical models developed to analyze the mechanisms responsible for crises. The first focuses on asset price bubbles, which have been associated with many crises. The second is focused on the dynamics of bank runs and panics, which have been especially common in the United States. Finally, I present an overview of the effects of crises and the mechanisms transmitting financial distress in the banking system into the rest of the economy.</content>

    <title>Structural Change and Jobless Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Benchmark models of structural transformation focus on the reallocation of employment across sectors while assuming that overall employment stays constant. We show that this assumption does not match facts for developing economies. We study a panel of 48 mostly developing economies over the period 1990--2018 and document a strong positive relationship between the share of the population employed in agriculture and the overall employment rate. That is, the early part of the development process is associated with a substantial decline in the total employment rate. Motivated by this finding, we extend a benchmark model of structural change featuring Stone-Geary preferences to allow for endogenous labor supply. We show that this model can account for the patterns we document in the data both qualitatively and quantitatively. We use a calibrated version of our model to study the employment dynamics in several developing economies and show that structural change is a quantitatively important source of employment changes during the early stages of development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite substantial convergence in men’s and women’s economic roles, gender gaps in labor market outcomes persist across countries. This article provides a unified framework for understanding how gender norms shape economic behavior, distinguishing between internalized norms—preferences and beliefs tied to gender identity—and external norms arising from peer pressure and social coordination. We first document cross-country and within-country variation in gender attitudes, alongside gradual but uneven shifts toward more egalitarian views. We then review empirical evidence on the origins, persistence, and transmission of gender norms, and their effects on human capital accumulation, labor supply, wages, and policy take-up. The review highlights both the durability of gender norms and the mechanisms through which policies, institutions, and media can induce norm change, with implications for the design of effective interventions.</content>

    <title>You Only Live Twice: Financial Inflows and Growth in a Westward-Facing Ukraine</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The monumental task of rebuilding postwar Ukraine requires early planning and identification of growth strategies. The earlier accession of Eastern European countries to the European Union and NATO offers a template that relies on massive foreign direct investment and public structural funds. This approach helps to raise incomes directly and can create a virtuous circle where capital deepening facilitates technological upgrades and repatriation of war refugees, which in turn stimulate more investment. We show theoretically that the government can refine this strategy by internalizing positive externalities from having a higher capital stock: Investment in physical capital relaxes borrowing constraints (thus allowing more capital inflows) and raises wages (thus encouraging more Ukrainian refugees to return home).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When do people identify with their class? Evidence from social psychology shows that individuals are more likely to identify with a group if they are similar to its members. We study early 20th century Britain and show that regional cultural heterogeneity combined with internal migration influenced class identity. We develop and validate a measure of class identity using naming decisions. Exploiting within-household variation, we show that migration patterns that increased the local share of culturally-distant workers reduced working class identification. Where migration increased the cultural distance of the working class, workers were less likely to join unions, voters were less likely to support the nascent Labour Party, and parliamentary candidates were less likely to target working class voters. By 1911, slower in-migration and rising local population growth reduced working class distance in urban areas, which also became strongholds of support for Labour. Migration alters social identity and creates political cleavages.</content>

    <title>Audit Centralization and Audit Quality: Evidence from Chinese Cities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Audit design invokes a tradeoff between a monitor’s local knowledge and their independence from influence. We study this tradeoff in the context of a pilot program in six Chinese provinces in 2016, in which provincial governments were given control over budgeting and personnel decisions for city audits. Using a difference-in-differences framework we show that, compared to non-pilot provinces, centralization increases detection of suspicious expenditures by over 50%. These improvements occur also in cities with auditors appointed pre-2016, suggesting that stronger incentives and greater resources rather than auditor selection explain the improvements. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that financial (but not human) resources devoted to city audits increase with centralization. Further results show that centralization’s benefits are strongest in provinces that centralized audit office financing as part of the reform – particularly in poorer cities – suggesting a role for resources in improved performance.</content>

    <title>Well-being Increases in Age Among Workers: Evidence From 103 Countries</title>

      <name>David G. Blanchflower &amp; Alex Bryson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how workers’ and non-workers’ wellbeing varies by age across 171 countries in eight international surveys. In 103 countries (60%) we find evidence that workers’ wellbeing rises with age and workers' illbeing falls with age. This relationship appears to have strengthened over time in some countries.  Patterns are different among non-workers and are sensitive to survey mode. Where surveys are conducted using Computer-Assisted Web-based Interviews (CAWI) non-workers’ wellbeing is U-shaped, but this is less clear-cut when the data are collected with Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI). The change in the age profile of workers’ wellbeing may reflect changes in selection into (out of) employment by age, changes in job quality, or changes in young workers’ orientation to similar jobs over time.  But changes in smartphone usage – often the focus of debate regarding declining young peoples’ wellbeing – are unlikely to be the main culprit unless there are sizeable differences in smartphone usage across young workers and non-workers, which appears unlikely.</content>

    <title>Changing Culture and Norms in Developing Countries</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey recent research on changing culture and social norms in developing countries and propose a simple framework to interpret these changes. We conceptualize individual utility from a given action as a function of three components: intrinsic valuations, material payoffs, and social interactions. Using this lens, we review evidence on interventions that target each component and their interactions.
First, we discuss efforts to shift intrinsic values through schooling and curricula, information campaigns, mass media, and empowerment programs, with particular attention to gender norms, intimate partner violence, and harmful practices such as female genital cutting. Second, we examine social determinants of behavior, including misperceptions about others’ beliefs, coordination failures, and the role of intermediate “stepping-stone” actions in facilitating or hindering norm transitions. Third, we analyze how changes in material incentives, via labor market opportunities, transfers, and legal reforms, affect behavior and underlying norms.
Throughout, we highlight methodological challenges in measuring norms and identifying mechanisms, and we emphasize that policy effects depend critically on existing social structures and belief distributions. We conclude by outlining open questions from a positive and normative perspective.</content>

    <title>Banking on Inattention</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Xu Lu &amp; Lingxuan Wu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that depositor inattention gives rise to banks’ deposit market power. Using transaction-level data on millions of U.S. depositors, we document that unscheduled income remains in low-rate accounts much longer than scheduled income, and interpret this reaction-time gap as inattention. Inattention varies widely across depositors, and more inattentive depositors adjust their balances less in response to monetary policy changes. We then develop and test a theory of temporal monopoly to analyze the implications of inattention for bank funding. Banks face an intertemporal trade-off in deposit rate setting between current spreads and the future deposit base, modulated by inattention. In line with this theory, we find that banks serving more inattentive depositors set lower rates, have weaker pass-through, and experience less deposit flow sensitivity. Using these estimates, we calibrate how the value of banks’ deposit franchise rises with inattention and varies nonmonotonically with the policy rate. Our results shed new light on how digital banking and monetary policy affect deposit funding.</content>

    <title>Managers and the Cultural Transmission of Gender Norms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how managers’ gender attitudes shape workplace culture and gender inequality. Using data from a multinational firm operating in over 100 countries, we leverage cross-country manager rotations to identify the effects of male managers' gender attitudes on gender pay gaps within a team. Managers from countries with one standard deviation more progressive gender attitudes reduce the pay gap by 5 percentage points (18%), largely through higher promotion rates for women. These effects persist after managers rotate out and are strongest in more conservative countries. Managers with progressive attitudes also influence the local office culture, as local managers who interact with but are not under the purview of the foreign manager begin to have smaller pay gaps in their teams. Our evidence points to individual managers as critical in shaping corporate culture.</content>

    <title>Enhancing Worker Productivity Without Automating Tasks: A Different Approach to AI and the Task-Based Model</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The task-based approach has become the dominant framework for studying the labor-market effects of artificial intelligence (AI), typically emphasizing the replacement of human workers by machines. Motivated by growing empirical evidence that contemporary AI is more often used as a tool that augments workers, this paper develops two related task-based models in which AI enhances worker productivity without automating tasks. Abstracting from capital, we develop a pair of related task-based models that examine how technological progress in AI that provides new tools to augment workers affects aggregate productivity and wage inequality. Both models emphasize the role of human capital in intermediating the effects of AI-related technological shocks. In the first model, AI use requires specialized expertise, and technological progress expands the set of tasks for which such expertise is effective. We show that a larger supply of AI expertise amplifies the productivity gains from improvements in AI technology while attenuating its adverse effects on wage inequality. The second model focuses on non-AI skills, allowing AI tools to alter the set of tasks that workers can perform given their skills. In equilibrium, workers allocate across tasks in response to wages, generating an endogenous distribution of skills across the task space. A central result is that aggregate productivity and wage inequality depend on different global properties of this equilibrium distribution: productivity is particularly sensitive to thinly staffed tasks that create bottlenecks, while wage inequality is driven by the concentration of workers in a narrow set of tasks. As a result, improvements in AI tools can induce non-monotonic co-movement between productivity and inequality. By linking these mechanisms to multidimensional human capital---including AI expertise and higher-order non-AI skills---the paper highlights the role of education and training policies in shaping the economic consequences of AI-driven technological change.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Charter Schools on Identification, Service Provision, and Achievement of Students with Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Students with disabilities (SWDs) encompass a sizable share of charter students and have an array of individualized needs. Charter schools may operate differently than traditional public schools with respect to SWDs and special education (SPED), as funding incentives may induce charter schools to underserve SWDs. Nonetheless, there is little empirical evidence regarding how enrollment in charter schools affects SWDs’ educational environments and outcomes. We use data from Michigan to estimate charter impacts using a heterogeneous difference-in-differences model that compares students who enter charters to students who have not yet but will eventually enter charters. We find that charters are slightly more likely to identify students as SWDs after charter entry. While assignments to SPED programs increase comparably, there is a significant reduction and subsequent reversion in time spent in SPED-specific environments and services provided. Despite these changes, SWDs realize achievement and attendance gains after charter entry at similar levels to non-SWDs.</content>

    <title>AI and the Quantity and Quality of Creative Products: Have LLMs Boosted Creation of Valuable Books?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the diffusion of LLMs between 2022 and 2025, new book releases have tripled, raising a question of AI's impact on book quality. We develop a ratings-based usage measure that is comparable across book release vintages, and we find that the vintages from the AI influx period have lower average quality.  Yet, the top 1,000 monthly releases per category - albeit not the top 100 - have higher quality than before; and the effect is larger in categories with faster growth in new titles. Authors entering since the LLM influx produce predominantly low-quality work; and the higher-quality output of pre-LLM authors entrants has risen. A nested logit calibration shows that LLM-enhanced book production could, in steady state, raise the surplus that consumers derive from book markets by a quarter to a half.</content>

    <title>Trade and US Inequality in the Tokyo Round</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Against a backdrop of sharply rising inequality, the Tokyo Round of the GATT resulted in a 1.6 percentage point reduction in average US tariffs – larger than CUSFTA, NAFTA, and the liberalization accompanying the granting of PNTR to China. We construct a novel IV based on the so-called “Swiss formula” that governed the Tokyo Round tariff liberalization to provide evidence of its effects on imports and inequality. Instrumented tariff reductions explain approximately 20% of the rise in income inequality between non-production and production workers between 1979 and 1988. This effect is largest among women, workers in routine occupations, and workers in more technology-intensive industries, suggesting a complementarity between trade liberalization and skill-biased technological change.</content>

    <title>Optimal Use of Preferences in Artificial Intelligence Algorithms</title>

      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning systems embed preferences either in training losses or through post-processing of calibrated predictions. Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision-problem-agnostic conditions under which separation—training preference-free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected-utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind—as documented in human-AI decision-making—preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through postprocessing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (A.I.) will likely be the most important technology we have ever developed. Technologies such as electricity, semiconductors, and the internet have been transformative, reshaping economic activity and dramatically increasing living standards throughout the world. In some sense, artificial intelligence is simply the latest of these general purpose technologies and at a minimum should continue the economic transformation that has been ongoing for the past century. However, the case can certainly be made that this time is different. Automating intelligence itself arguably has broader effects than electricity or semiconductors. What if machines—A.I. for cognitive tasks and A.I. plus advanced robots for physical tasks—can perform every task a human can do but more cheaply?  What does economics have to say about this possibility, and what might our economic future look like?</content>

    <title>Why Does Height Pay? Evidence from the Kenya Life Panel Survey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taller people earn more, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We present among the first evidence of this phenomenon in Africa, using longitudinal microdata on a cohort of middle-aged Kenyan adults. We document a substantial height/earnings premium: controlling for gender, age, and other socio-demographics, monthly earnings increase by 1.07% per centimeter (or 2.72% per inch). Nearly half this effect can be explained by differences in cognition, measured from an unusually rich battery containing 27 modules. Additional shares of the premium can be attributed to measures of physical strength and non-cognitive ability. In contrast to prior work, we find little role for occupational sorting: conditional on cognitive and non-cognitive ability, taller people do not appear more likely to work in higher paid sectors. Leveraging repeated measures of height and an instrumental variables specification, we find suggestive evidence that measurement error may be attenuating the estimated relationship.</content>

    <title>Welfare Added? Optimal Teacher Assignment with Value-Added Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how teacher "value added" should inform optimal teacher-assignment policy. Our welfare-theoretic framework illustrates (1) how theoretically optimal assignments leverage variation in teachers' impacts both across student types and across different outcomes, and (2) how empirically optimal assignments trade off improved targeting from estimating richer student heterogeneity against increasing misallocation risk. In practice, optimal assignments use limited student types (only lagged achievement) and multiple outcomes (not just math). Even after correcting for policy overfitting, assignments raise average present-value earnings by $2,800 and increase lower-achieving students' earnings by 70-156% more than benchmark value-added policies that assume that teacher effects are homogeneous across students, that allow for heterogeneous effects across students but for a single subject, or teacher deselection.</content>

    <title>Driving Innovation: The Policy Tools Powering Electric Vehicle Technological Inventions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for cutting transportation emissions, yet the policy drivers of EV innovation remain underexplored. This study analyzes firm-level panel data on EV and battery patents, covering more than 4,000 firms across 19 countries from 2010 to 2021, to assess how these policy tools and their interactions in different time horizons influence innovative activity. We test the effects of individual policy instruments that either raise demand for EVs or support the development of EV technologies.  Stringent fuel-economy standards, financial incentives, adoption targets, and public R&amp;D investments each significantly increase patenting in EV and battery technologies. Moreover, long-term EV targets amplify the innovative impact of public R&amp;D and standards while diminishing the marginal effect of short-term price signals. The results suggest that governments can accelerate clean automotive innovation by combining long-term adoption commitments with sustained R&amp;D investment or strong performance standards, and by managing these instruments as a coordinated policy portfolio rather than as separate tools. The study contributes cross-country, firm-level evidence that links policy design to the direction of clean technology innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter surveys the economics and political science literature on clientelism. We define clientelism as the exchange of votes or electoral participation for targeted material benefits and argue that it undermines electoral accountability, fostering rent-seeking and the underprovision of public goods. We document the prevalence of clientelism across countries and over time and examine how economic underdevelopment both facilitates clientelistic practices and may be perpetuated by them. We then analyze the agency problems that characterize clientelistic exchanges, focusing on broker–voter and politician–broker relationships, and review evidence on the roles of monitoring, selection, and social networks in sustaining these relationships. Finally, we discuss how clientelistic machines are financed, assess interventions aimed at weakening clientelism and promoting programmatic competition, and outline directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Mapping Technological Trajectories: Evidence from Two Centuries of Patent Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a methodology to measure cross-country trends in innovation capability - “technological trajectories” and implement this on a new rich dataset covering patents between 1836 and 2016 across multiple countries. Intuitively, trajectories are revealed by a country’s sustained increases in patenting across multiple patent offices. We first describe the data patterns, showing the relative decline of the UK, and the rise first of the US and Germany, and then later of Japan and China. We then econometrically estimate trajectories on (i) the post-1902 period for France, Germany, Japan, the UK and US, and (ii) the post-1960 period for a wider sample of 40 countries. Our trajectories are strongly positively correlated with Total Factor Productivity growth, and also (but less strongly) associated with the growth of labour productivity and capital intensity. We show that future trajectories are predicted by a country’s initial levels of R&amp;D, education and defence spending, classic drivers of innovation in modern growth theory.</content>

    <title>Wedges: A Microeconomic Perspective on Misallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter takes stock of what has been learned from the recent micro-development literature about wedges—mechanisms generating dispersion in marginal revenue products of factors across firms, which are commonly interpreted as indicators of misallocation. We present a general theoretical framework that allows us to consider several different types of wedges simultaneously. We argue that it is important to distinguish between between technological wedges, which are present even in the efficient allocation that would be chosen by the social planner, and distortionary wedges, which are present in market equilibrium but not the social planner's allocation. Not all wedges, as we have defined them, are distortionary. We also argue that interactions among wedges are pervasive. We review empirical findings about different types of wedges—taxes, regulations, political connections, corruption, market power, contracting frictions, upgrading investments, and search—focusing on studies that present direct evidence on particular wedges and how they generate dispersion in marginal returns to factors. Throughout, we pay special attention to how wedges vary with firm size and whether the evidence supports the “large firms are constrained” view of development. We conclude with thoughts about promising directions for the misallocation literature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare trends in absolute poverty before (1939–1963) and after (1963–2023) the War on Poverty was declared. Our primary methodological contribution is to create a post-tax post-transfer income measure using the 1940, 1950 and 1960 Decennial Censuses through imputations of taxes and transfers as well as certain forms of market income including perquisites (Collins and Wanamaker 2022), consistent with the full income measures developed by Burkhauser et al. (2024) for subsequent years. From 1939–1963, poverty fell by 29 percentage points, with even larger declines for Black people and all children. While absolute poverty continued to fall following the War on Poverty’s declaration, the pace was no faster, even when evaluating the trends relative to a consistent initial poverty rate. Furthermore, the pre-1964 decline in poverty among working age adults and children was achieved almost completely through increases in market income, during which time only 2–3 percent of working age adults were dependent on the government for at least half of their income, compared to dependency rates of 7–15 percent from 1972–2023. In contrast to progress on absolute poverty, reductions in relative poverty were more modest from 1939–1963 and even less so since then.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a randomized experiment with 553 science- and technology-based startups in 12 co-working spaces across the US to evaluate the effects of intensive, short-term entrepreneurial training programs on survival and performance for innovation-driven startups. Treated startups are more likely to shut down their businesses and do so sooner than control startups. Conditional on survival, however, treated startups are more likely to raise external funding for their ventures, raise funding faster, and raise more funding than the control group; they also exhibit higher employment and revenue. Treated founders are less likely to found a new startup after shutdown. Our findings are consistent with practitioner arguments that early entrepreneurship training interventions can help entrepreneurs with less viable ventures “rationally quit” (“fail fast”). We use machine learning techniques (causal random forest) to provide exploratory insights on the most impacted subgroups.</content>

    <title>The Redistributive Effects of Federal Medicaid Outlays Across Counties: Evidence from the ACA</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act reshaped federal transfer inflows to counties using state Medicaid expansions between 2014 and 2017. We show that the ACA expansion increased federal Medicaid transfers by $361 per capita in expansion counties. Using our estimates, we forecast that non-expansion counties would gain $554 per capita if they expanded Medicaid. These transfers flow to counties with lower tax capacity and lower gross income. Our findings suggest that Medicaid expansion was a health policy intervention that also functioned as a budgetary mechanism reshaping federal to local transfers and fiscal smoothing across U.S. counties.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Effects of Neighborhood Policies: a Dynamic Analysis</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the macroeconomic effects of neighborhood-specific policies in a general equilibrium model of a city with endogenous residential sorting and educational investment. A key feature of the model is the presence of endogenous local spillovers that depend on the distribution of families across neighborhoods. We analyze three policies: a housing-voucher policy inspired by the MTO program, which enables poor families to relocate to low-poverty neighborhoods; a place-based transfer (PBT) policy that provides monetary transfers to families in poor neighborhoods; and a place-based investment (PBI) policy that invests resources in local institutions, such as public schools, to directly enhance local spillovers. We find that the MTO policy generates substantial income gains for children of recipient families, but scaling up the program dampens these gains and induces large welfare losses for non-recipients. By contrast, the PBT policy delivers larger average welfare gains but is less effective in reducing inequality and segregation. Finally, the PBI policy produces smaller short-run effects but, over time, resolves the trade-off by raising average welfare while simultaneously reducing inequality, lowering segregation, and improving intergenerational mobility.</content>

    <title>Immigration Restrictions and Natives' Intergenerational Mobility: Evidence from the 1920s US Quota Acts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of immigration restrictions on the intergenerational mobility of US-born men in the United States. We link US-born sons observed in 1900, 1920, and 1940 full-count Censuses to their fathers, and construct a measure of county-level exposure to the 1920s immigration acts, which sharply curtailed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. Exploiting this policy-induced variation, we find that the quotas reduced intergenerational mobility among US-born white men, but had no adverse effect for Black men. Among whites, losses were smaller for sons of richer fathers, who were more likely to migrate away from highly exposed areas. Evidence from the 1940 Census indicates that exposed white men were less likely to be employed and earned lower wages in adulthood, consistent with both occupational downgrading and reduced productivity within occupations. We show that these effects operated through both reduced immigrant–native complementarities and incomplete substitution from unrestricted migration, while human capital investment can  explain at most only a modest part of the total effect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a  framework for estimating demand across multiple assets with bidding  data. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on price instruments, which are often difficult to obtain. We describe the data requirements for implementation and illustrate its versatility using two applications: message-level data from Nasdaq and bidder-level data from Canadian Treasury bill auctions.  We argue that understanding demand systems is a crucial factor in assessing the impact of market design on price stability and liquidity.</content>

    <title>How do Foundations Help Charities (Beyond Giving them Money)?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foundations are a rapidly growing source of charitable support, yet their effects on nonprofits remain poorly understood. We study applicants to a $100 million funding competition whose sponsoring foundation subsequently offered publicity, networking, and advice to a subset of unsuccessful entrants. This support substantially improved later fundraising for smaller charities. Our estimates indicate that the foundation’s support generated over $40 million in income in the years following the competition. These findings offer novel evidence of how large donors can influence nonprofit success even without awarding funds, and show how funding competitions might be structured to help charities raise additional resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mental illness exacts a heavy toll on the US healthcare system and strains general hospitals and their emergency departments. We study how psychiatric inpatient facility entry impacts the local hospital industry. We find that referrals, including from the legal system, are redirected to the specialized facilities––leaving general hospitals with approximately 60% fewer psychiatric admissions. General hospitals also discharge 50% more patients to psychiatric facilities and substitute away from high-skill psychiatric labor––consistent with specialization and market segmentation. Emergency department volumes do not change but care does. However, community-based crime, overdose deaths, and suicides do not decline in the short-run.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Selection and the Puzzle of Slow Climate Change Adaptation in U.S. Agriculture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-run studies of agricultural productivity use balanced county-level panel data to document slow adaptation to climate change in U.S. agriculture. We revisit this treatment-effect puzzle using a selection model that incorporates the optimizing behavior of heterogeneous farmers. Using data from 1980 to 2020, we document three dynamic selection effects. First, counties that completely exit farming alter the composition of the balanced panel sample. Second, higher-skilled workers are more likely to leave rural areas as weather conditions worsen. Third, smaller farms consolidate into larger farms in counties affected by climate change. We document that the yield damage function’s slope depends on the county’s educational level and farm size.  Causal estimates of weather impacts must account for selection effects along several adaptation margins of adjustment.</content>

    <title>The Life-cycle of Concentrated Industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are competition policies designed for static industries suitable for innovative industries where dynamic competition for the market is key? If not, how should policies differ? We develop a model of the life-cycle of an oligopolistic industry: a version of Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994) with a finite number of firms. The equilibrium features a period of intense entry, followed by a shakeout and eventual industry concentration as some firms scale through innovation while most exit. We analyze the second-best problem of a government subsidizing small firms to promote competition. Innovation and dynamic competition do not necessarily justify intervention, as the equilibrium can still be second best. In general, the optimal policy depends on the nature of competition. Firms primarily compete for the market when innovation leads to large differences in scale. The government can wait to intervene in this case; committing to do whatever it takes to promote competition if and when the industry concentrates excessively. Subsidies early in the life-cycle are unnecessary. These results contrast with calls for aggressive ex-ante regulation in highly innovative industries, suggesting a wait-and-see approach may be preferable. We apply these insights to digital and AI industries in the U.S. using data on venture-backed firms.</content>

    <title>Life-Cycle Effects of Women's Education on their Careers and Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the causal effect of women's education on their wages, non-wage job amenities, and spillovers to children. Using a regression discontinuity at the school entry birthdate cutoff, we find that women born just before the cutoff are more likely to complete some college, and experience multi-dimensional career gains that grow over the life cycle: greater employment and earnings, as well as more professional and higher-status jobs, more socially meaningful work, and better working conditions. Children’s early-life health and prenatal inputs improve in tandem with career improvements, consistent with professional advances spurring—not hindering—infant investments. Career gains are concentrated in jobs that require exactly some college, the same schooling margin shifted by the cutoff, which indicates that increased post-secondary education is the primary channel for these effects. Together, the results show that women's college attendance generates large career returns—from both wages and amenities—that strengthen over time and produce meaningful benefits for children.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a dynamic model of the U.S. space launch industry. The model allows past launches to improve rocket reliability and lower launch costs. It also allows the government to make forward-looking procurement choices. We use the model to analyze policy-relevant issues in the recent history of the industry: the 2006 United Launch Alliance “merger-to-monopoly” and the effects of efficiencies in the form of learning synergies; innovations, such as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and ULA's recent introduction of Vulcan Centaur; the costs and benefits of forward-looking procurements; and, the trade-offs between the advantages of centralized control and possible inefficiencies.</content>

    <title>The Future of Monetarism after Milton Friedman</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On the fiftieth anniversary of Milton Friedman receiving the Nobel Prize in economics, I reflect on the legacy of monetarism – his revolutionary idea. Friedman developed the modern quantity of money in 1956 as a challenge to the prevailing Keynesian view that “money did not matter.” Friedman’s empirical and historical research made a strong case that changes in the money supply, largely instituted by the monetary authorities, account for much of the macro instability in the twentieth century including the Great Recession 1929-1933 and the Great Inflation 1965 -1982. Friedman’s ideas were at the base of the creation of modern macroeconomics, and of the adoption by many central banks of rules based monetary policy as a guidepost to maintain credibility for low inflation. His emphasis on monetary aggregates as the key monetary policy tool has been superseded by the use of policy interest rates, but the monetary aggregates are still useful as a crosscheck against incipient high inflation.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Effects of Climate Policy Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel measure of climate policy uncertainty based on newspaper coverage. Our index spikes during key U.S. climate policy events—including presidential announcements on international agreements, congressional debates, and regulatory disputes—and shows a recent upward trend. Using an instrument for plausibly exogenous uncertainty shifts, we find that higher climate policy uncertainty decreases output and emissions while raising commodity and consumer prices, acting as supply rather than demand shocks. Faced with this trade-off, monetary policy does not accommodate climate policy uncertainty shocks, shaping their transmission. Firm-level analyses show stronger declines in investment and R&amp;D when firms have higher climate change exposure.</content>

    <title>What Happens When Dating Goes Online? Evidence from U.S. Marriage Markets and Health Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how online dating platforms have impacted marital outcomes, assortative matching, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates in the United States. We construct county-level measures of online dating usage using data from website-based platforms (2002–2013) and mobile app-based platforms (2017–2023). Leveraging county-level variation and an instrumental variable strategy, we show in the desktop era, a 1% increase in online dating sessions raises divorce rates by 0.50%, while in the mobile era, a 1% increase in online dating activity lowers marriage and divorce rates by 0.40% and 0.33%, respectively. We also document shifts in assortative matching. Desktop sites reduce sorting along education and employment dimensions, whereas mobile sites reduce sorting by employment, but increase sorting by race. Across both eras, we find no evidence that greater online dating usage increases average STD rates. Average effects are negative or statistically insignificant, but are positive for some subpopulations. We develop a search and matching model where technological changes that impact search costs, market size, and market noise can explain our empirical findings.</content>

    <title>Is the Environmental Exposure Gap Shrinking? Evidence from an Extreme Multi-exposure Index</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demographic disparities in exposure to various sources of environmental stress are well documented. While specific stressors are linked to adverse health outcomes, there is uncertainty about how they interact. A first step towards evaluating these joint impacts is to understand the degree to which the same individuals are exposed to extreme simultaneous exposure to each stressor. Here, we adapt the Alkire-Foster multi-dimensional poverty measure to rank exposures to multi-dimensional environmental harm in a way that accounts for the frequency, breadth, and severity of exposure among the extremely exposed. This measure can be used to normatively compare distributions of extreme simultaneous exposure for a given group both across time and in comparison with other groups. We use publicly-available data on air toxics, PM2.5, and land surface temperature to identify trends in the multi-exposure index for socio-demographic groups based on race/ethnicity and poverty status for 168 U.S. cities. Controlling for city-characteristics, we find persistent, yet narrowing, multi-exposure gaps on the basis of race/ethnicity between people of color (POC) and non-Hispanic White. Within each group, individuals in households above the poverty line fare better than those below, but above-poverty POC have similar multi-exposure to below-poverty non-Hispanic White.</content>

    <title>Creating High-Opportunity Neighborhoods: Evidence from the HOPE VI Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether low-economic-mobility neighborhoods can be transformed into high-mobility areas by analyzing the HOPE VI program, which invested $17 billion to revitalize 262 distressed public housing developments. We estimate the program’s impacts using a matched difference-in-differences design, comparing outcomes in revitalized developments to observably similar control developments using anonymized tax records. HOPE VI reduced neighborhood poverty rates by attracting higher-income families to revitalized neighborhoods, but had no causal impact on the earnings of adults living in public housing units. Children raised in revitalized public housing units earned more, were more likely to attend college, and were less likely to be incarcerated. Using a movers exposure design and sibling comparisons, we show that these improvements were driven by changes in neighborhoods’ causal effects on children’s outcomes. The improvements in neighborhood causal effects were driven in large part by changes in social interaction: HOPE VI increased interaction between public housing residents and peers in surrounding neighborhoods and increased earnings more for subgroups with higher-income peers. Many low-income families in the U.S. currently live in neighborhoods that are as socially isolated as the HOPE VI developments were prior to revitalization. We conclude that it is feasible to create high-opportunity neighborhoods and that connecting socially isolated areas to surrounding communities is a cost-effective approach to doing so.</content>

    <title>School Vaping Bans and Youth E-Cigarette Use</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the goal of curbing electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use among youths, 40 states and the District of Columbia have adopted restrictions on nicotine vaping at elementary and secondary (K-12) schools. This study is the first to estimate the effect of K-12 school vaping restrictions (SVRs) on ENDS use among youth. Using data from several nationally representative data sources and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find little evidence that school indoor vaping restrictions reduce youth ENDS use. With 95% confidence, we can rule out SVR-induced youth vaping declines of more than 3.5%. Descriptive evidence suggests that students may respond to SVRs by substituting to smaller vaping devices and vaping in school locations that are less easily detectable by school employees (e.g., bathrooms and locker rooms). In contrast, we find that comprehensive vaping restrictions covering school campuses, workplaces, restaurants, and drinking establishments are associated with a 1.5-2.6 percentage-point reduction in teen nicotine vaping. This result is concentrated on the initiation margin of use and is consistent with the hypothesis that broader place-based restrictions increase the costs of youth ENDS use.</content>

    <title>Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework, with Application to Global Equity Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper.  In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are  orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a  detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish three facts about work from home (WFH) in the United States. First, employees WFH more often at younger firms – almost twice as often at firms founded after 2015 than at firms founded before 1990. Second, employees working under younger CEOs have higher levels of WFH. The average WFH rate is 1.4 days per week when the CEO is under 30, compared to 1.1 days when the CEO is 60 or older. Third, the self-employed WFH more than twice as often as wage-and-salary employees. These facts highlight the importance of organizational and managerial attributes for the prevalence of WFH.</content>

    <title>Extractive Taxation and the French Revolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we provide systematic evidence in support of the long-standing hypothesis that taxation was an important driver of the French Revolution. We first document that areas with heavier taxes experienced more riots between 1750 and 1789 and voiced more complaints against taxation in the cahiers de doléances of 1789. After showing that these effects are driven by indirect taxes, we exploit sharp spatial differences in the salt tax and the traites—the two principal indirect levies—to implement a regression discontinuity design (RDD).We find that unrest was higher on the high-tax side of the border. These effects intensified over time, peaking in the 1780s, and were stronger where fiscal disparities were larger and Enlightenment ideas more widespread. We further show that adverse weather shocks amplified unrest in high-tax municipalities. We then document that taxation fueled the spread of unrest during the Grande Peur—the wave of revolts that swept France in July 1789 and culminated in the abolition of feudal privileges. Finally, we link taxation to revolutionary politics in Paris, documenting that deputies from heavily taxed constituencies were more likely to frame the tax system as oppressive, support the Revolution, demand the abolition of the monarchy, and vote for the king’s execution.</content>

    <title>Interest Rates and Equity Valuations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large body of work has sought to measure the effect of interest rates on equity valuations. The challenge in doing so is that both are endogenous, and their comovement depends on the forces driving interest-rate changes. To address this problem, we develop and estimate a decomposition that splits movements in real rates into three structural drivers: changes in expected growth, risk, or “pure discounting.” We show that only pure discount-rate shocks transmit one-for-one to equity valuations, with little or negative transmission of growth and risk shocks. Implementing our decomposition with a global panel of growth expectations and asset prices, we find a weak unconditional relation between valuations and real rates but a strong relation with the pure discounting component, which explains 80% of cross-country valuation changes since 1990. In the U.S., we find that 35% of the interest-rate decline is attributable to pure discounting, implying that only a fraction of the change in rates has passed through directly to equities. We use the decomposition to revisit evidence on the role of interest rates in explaining price variation, and to study higher-frequency returns, cross-sectional rate exposures, duration-matched equity premia, and reactions to monetary policy.</content>

    <title>ICE Arrests across Trump's First and Second Terms: Variation in Targeting, Method, and Geography</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deportation is often framed as a necessary tool to protect public safety by removing people who commit crimes. We use newly available, and externally validated, administrative data containing all US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests from September 2015-October 2025. Beyond demonstrating national trends in immigration arrests by method and composition over time, we are also able to compare, for the first time, apprehensions spanning the start of the two Trump administrations, both of which focused on mass immigration enforcement. Our results reveal that the reality of immigration enforcement diverges sharply from the public narrative: while arrests spiked at the outset of both Trump presidencies, there were significant declines in the percentage of arrested individuals with criminal convictions, with especially marked declines in 2025. Examining potential mechanisms reveals that this is driven by a change in ICE tactics, but even conditional on tactic, as arrests rose, the percent with a criminal record declined. Moreover, we find substantial heterogeneity over time and across ICE Areas of Responsibility. Taken together, our results highlight a substantial gap between political rhetoric and reality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using new data from the Gallup Workforce Panel, we document a persistent partisan gap in self-reported AI use at work: Democrats are consistently more likely than Republicans to report frequent use. In 2025:Q4, for example, 27.8% of Democrats report using AI weekly or daily, compared with 22.5% of Republicans. Democrats also report deeper task-level integration, using AI in 16% more work activities than Republicans. Consistent with this, Democrats are employed in occupations with higher predicted AI exposure based on task-content measures and report larger perceived differences in AI-related job displacement risk. However, in regression models the partisan gap in AI use disappears once we control for education, industry, and occupation, indicating that observed differences primarily reflect compositional variation rather than political affiliation per se.</content>

    <title>Coca’s Return and the American Overdose Fallout</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Colombian coca cultivation fell dramatically between 2000 and 2015, a period that saw intense U.S.-backed eradication and interdiction efforts. That progress reversed in 2015, when peace talks and legal rulings in Colombia opened enforcement gaps. Coca plantation has since increased to record levels, which coincided with a sharp rise in cocaine-related overdose deaths in the U.S. We estimate how much of that rise can be causally attributed to Colombia’s new coca boom. Leveraging the unforeseen coca supply shock and cross-county differences in pre-shock cocaine exposure, we find that the surge in supply caused an immediate rise in overdose mortality in the U.S. Our analysis estimates on the order of 1,000–1,500 additional U.S. deaths per year in the late 2010s can be attributed to Colombia’s cocaine boom. Implicit annual loss in American statistical life values about $48,000 per hectare of cultivation in Colombia. If left untamed, the current level of coca cultivation (over 230,000 ha in 2022) may impose on the order of $10 billion per year in costs via overdose fatalities.</content>

    <title>How Does Tort Reform Affect Health Care Delivery?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health care costs in the U.S. have grown dramatically over the past several decades, with one possible cause being physicians providing unnecessary services out of fear of being sued for malpractice – a phenomenon known as “defensive medicine”. States responded by enacting different types of tort reforms. This paper reviews the literature on the effects of these tort reforms on outcomes related to malpractice risk, quantity and quality of health care services, overall utilization and expenditures, physician supply, and patient affordability. We use Google Scholar to identify papers that fall into this scope and use either associational or quasi-experimental quantitative methods. The preponderance of evidence points towards non-economic damage caps reducing malpractice risk, quantity of services (aside from diagnostics and obstetrics), and overall health care utilization and expenditures while increasing physician supply and not having detrimental effects on patient outcomes. In general, the effects of other types of tort reforms are less clear. The literature would benefit from further research utilizing recent methodological advances related to combining machine learning with causal inference and eliminating bias from heterogeneous treatment effects in staggered-treatment-time models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an RCT with college students in Chennai (N=340), we test how modest financial incentives and personalized feedback affect the uptake and targeting (by symptom severity) of free therapy. Despite 56% of students screening positive for at least mild depression or anxiety, only 3% in the control group took up therapy. A small cash incentive increased appointments by 9 percentage points (p = 0.06) on average without substantially affecting targeting. Personalized feedback and recommendations based on a mental health screening tool significantly improved targeting while keeping overall take-up largely unchanged. Combining these two treatments achieved both higher take-up and improved targeting, by increasing appointments among symptomatic individuals by 21 pp (p &lt; 0.01) without affecting uptake by asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that low-cost incentives coupled with screening information can effectively increase uptake while allocating limited mental health care resources to those with greater need.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study residential segregation and access to public services across 1.5 million urban and rural neighborhoods in India. Muslim and Scheduled Caste segregation in India is high by global standards, and only slightly lower than Black-White segregation in the U.S. Within cities, public facilities and infrastructure are systematically less available in Muslim and Scheduled Caste neighborhoods. Nearly all regressive allocation is across neighborhoods within cities—at the most informal and least studied form of government. These inequalities are not visible in the aggregate data typically used for research and policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a micro-founded monetary model of the world economy to study international currency competition. Our model features "unipolar'' equilibria, with a single dominant international currency, and "multipolar'' equilibria, in which multiple currencies circulate internationally. Long-run equilibria are highly history-dependent and tend towards the emergence of a dominant currency. Governments can compete to internationalize their currencies by offering attractive interest rates on their sovereign debt, but large economies have a natural advantage in ensuring the dominance of their currencies. We calibrate the model to assess the quantitative importance of these mechanisms and study the international monetary system's dynamics under several counterfactual scenarios.</content>

    <title>Early Learning Across Decades: Advances in Measuring Head Start Effectiveness</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Head Start program, launched in 1965 and targeted to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, remains the largest early childhood care and education (ECE) program in the United States and the only one deployed at the federal level. As such, the Head Start literature spans several decades and now allows for synthesis of findings from different contexts, time periods, and research designs. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the rigorous evidence measuring Head Start’s effects on children, their families, and society. The focus is on how (1) the contrast between program and counterfactual conditions, (2) takeup of the program among eligible populations, and (3) treatment–effect heterogeneity inform interpretation and applicability of key findings. The paper presents implications of the evidence for the modern-day Head Start program and an adjacent, policy-relevant research agenda.</content>

    <title>Screen More, Sell Later: Screening and Dynamic Signaling in the Mortgage Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic model of asset origination with unobservable screening effort and signaling of loan quality through delayed sale by extending Vanasco (2017). The theory predicts a positive relationship between screening effort and the strength of the signal. We test this central prediction using U.S. mortgage data, measuring screening effort by mortgage processing time. Consistent with the theory, loans that take longer to process are sold with longer delay and are less likely to default, even though observably riskier loans are processed more slowly. Our calibration reveals that the subprime mortgage market operated in a parameter range with endogenous fragility.</content>

    <title>Field Experiments in the Science of Science: Lessons from Peer Review and the Evaluation of New Knowledge</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Kevin Boudreau</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scientific evaluation and peer review govern the allocation of resources and certification of knowledge in science, yet have been subjected to limited causal investigation. This chapter synthesizes randomized experiments embedded in live peer-evaluation systems at journals, conferences, and funding agencies, restricting attention to published studies. I organize this evidence using a Q–A–R–S framework that decomposes peer review into attributes of submissions (Q), authors (A), reviewers (R), and evaluation systems (S), and interpret outcomes through a view of the core problem of scientific evaluation as assessing new knowledge using the existing stock of knowledge.
The chapter treats experimental design choices as objects of analysis, assessing what existing interventions can—and cannot—identify given their designs and settings, the institutional constraints they face, and opportunities for higher-leverage experimentation. I show that randomized experimentation embedded in peer review spans the full Q–A–R–S space, albeit sparsely, and yields uneven but informative insights across different margins.
Based on the full body of evidence, I advance several novel claims: (1) system interventions often affect participant behavior with little impact on core evaluative judgments; (2) core evaluations are most clearly shaped by who reviews and their expertise; and (3) peer review functions more reliably as a “filter” of poor submissions than as a fine-grained “ranker” of acceptable submissions. Overall, the evidence points to a functioning institution operating under binding epistemic and organizational constraints, rather than to systemic failure. I identify channels for improving the speed, cost, and reliability of scientific evaluation institutions.
Substantial scope remains to redesign embedded experiments to increase inferential power, generalizability, and cumulative insight, while reducing disruption and more tightly linking to institutional innovation and policy changes.</content>

    <title>Searching for Fish in Trees (緣木求魚)? Economic Development when Context Matters</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this chapter, we develop a framework for analyzing the determinants of economic development and their implications for policy. We distinguish between classical determinants—such as inputs into education and health, access to credit, and geography—and non-classical determinants—including cultural values, social norms, beliefs, identity, and social organization. We classify these determinants along two policy-relevant dimensions: whether they can be clearly ranked in terms of their contribution to development (vertical versus horizontal) and whether they can be directly altered through policy intervention (manipulable versus non-manipulable).We show that even for classical determinants, policy impacts are often hard to predict and are mediated by local social and cultural context. These issues are more pronounced for non-classical determinants, which are more complicated to change through policy intervention and more difficult to rank in welfare terms. In some cases, traits commonly viewed as obstacles to development may be well-adapted to local conditions or even supportive of economic performance, a possibility we refer to as “reverse vertical.” Building on Hirschman’s (1967) distinction between trait-making and trait-taking policymaking, we argue that interventions that attempt to directly transform non-classical determinants often rest on fragile assumptions about ranking and manipulability and risk generating unintended or adverse effects. By contrast, many of the most successful development episodes of the past several decades relied on policies that took existing social and cultural traits as given and designed institutions, technologies, and incentives that worked within those contexts rather than attempting to overturn them.</content>

    <title>Progress or Backsliding? Changes in the Gender Wage Gap for Business Professionals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, much of the gap in earnings between men and women is due to the persistent gap for high wage earners. This paper explores changes in the gender wage gap for MBAs graduating from a large public university over 30 years. We document large gender wage gaps on average, which grow in the course of men’s and women’s careers. Comparing graduates at identical career stages across time periods to address composition concerns, we show that the raw gender wage gap has shrunk by 33 to 50 percent over the last two decades. Additionally, the temporal pattern of the gap has fundamentally shifted: while gaps only emerged over time in earlier decades, significant gaps now emerge immediately. Convergence in labor supply factors, particularly hours worked, explains much of the narrowing gap, alongside shifts in industry composition. However, unexplained wage gaps persist for recent graduates from the very start of their careers, suggesting different underlying mechanisms across cohorts. These findings highlight both progress in gender wage equity among business professionals and concerning patterns that emerge earlier in careers than in previous decades.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital—encompassing cognitive skills and personality traits—is central for labor-market success, yet personality remains difficult to measure at scale. Leveraging advances in AI and comprehensive LinkedIn microdata, we extract the Big 5 personality traits from facial images of 96,000 MBA graduates, and demonstrate that this novel “Photo Big 5” predicts school rank, job matching, compensation, job transitions, and career advancement. The Photo Big 5 provides predictive power comparable to race, attractiveness, and educational background, and is only weakly correlated with cognitive measures such as test scores. We show that individuals systematically sort into occupations where their personality traits are valued and earn higher wages when traits align with occupational demands. While the scalability of the Photo Big 5 enables new academic insights into the role of personality in labor markets, its growing use in industry screening raises important ethical concerns regarding statistical discrimination and individual autonomy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI use for content generation is associated with divergent outcomes on different financial social media platforms: indications of reasoning enhancement on Seeking Alpha, and of belief distortions on WallStreetBets. On Seeking Alpha, adoption is associated with information frictions. AI-assisted postings tilt toward  analysis/credibility, and their sentiment positively predicts future returns. Use of AI is associated with more informative retail order flow and lower bid-ask spreads. In contrast, AI adoption on WallStreetBets follows surges in retail buying, and AI-assisted  content is associated with emotionality and sentiment contagion. Such content precedes higher trading volume, greater volatility, and more lottery-like return distributions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the sectoral reallocation of employment over time and across countries, with a focus on the rise of services. We document substantial changes in the ratio of aggregate employment to working-age population across countries that are not systematically related to productivity growth or income levels, yet tightly linked to the rise in services employment. We assess the quantitative contribution of changes in aggregate employment to the rise of services using an otherwise standard model of sectoral reallocation calibrated to time-series for the United States. The calibrated model implies a high elasticity of changes in aggregate employment to services: a one percentage point change in aggregate employment generates on average a 0.7 percentage point change in services employment. The implication is that actual changes in aggregate employment account for one-third of the rise in services, on average across countries, and up to one-half in countries with sustained employment increases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measuring aggregate inflation is subject to two opposing biases: unobserved quality and variety growth, and the use of incorrect weights when new varieties are misclassified. We show that it is possible to measure an aggregate price index free of these biases when we have a subset of products where these two errors average to zero. This procedure does not require us to distinguish new from existing goods, measure quality attributes directly, or classify new varieties into the appropriate category. We implement this approach using BEA data from 1959 to 2019, approximating the official PCE price index with a CES aggregate of BEA prices at the product level. Our estimate of the inflation rate exceeds the CES aggregate of BEA prices by 0.3 to 1.0 percentage points per year on average. The aggregate bias was close to zero prior to the BLS introducing hedonic adjustments, which suggests that only adjusting for quality bias can lead to an underestimation of overall inflation, particularly in quality-adjusted categories.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments rely on private firms to provide public goods and services. Although competition among these firms reduces prices and the costs of procurement, it has an ambiguous effect on fraud: competition can both dissipate the rents that attracted fraudulent firms to the market while at the same time reducing margins to the point where legitimate firms no longer remain viable. We study this tradeoff in the government’s procurement of durable medical equipment. Following Medicare’s switch from regulated prices to competitive bidding, we find that fraudulent firms’ cost advantage allowed them to gain market share as legitimate firms exited the market.</content>

    <title>Loan-funded Loans: Equity-like Liabilities inside Bank Holding Companies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging regulatory data on fund flows within bank holding companies (BHCs), we characterize internal loans as a critical funding source for commercial banks. Although recorded as bank liabilities, parent-to-bank internal loans function as contingent support that resembles capital. We show that internal-loan funded banks do not hoard liquidity; instead, they originate larger and longer-maturity loans at lower spreads, initiate more relationships with marginal borrowers, and retain larger shares in syndicated deals. Internal-loan-funded lending is followed by higher short-run profits but higher future nonperforming loan ratios. We further show that organizational structure shapes internal lending: in BHCs with both bank and nonbank operations, nonbank affiliates crowd out internal lending to banks and discipline banks’ use of internal funds, and these BHCs exhibit higher overall performance. To identify our tests, we exploit the passage of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act and the announcement of the Basel III Accord, using instrumental variables and discontinuity-design approaches. Our findings highlight an equity-like internal debt channel that shapes monetary policy transmission, risk-taking, and the role of organizational structure in banking.</content>

    <title>Class Mobility in the Era of Rising Inequality: A Synthetic Dynasty Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies contemporary trends in class mobility using a new approach based on the “synthetic dynasties” represented in Markov chains. This approach yields several novel measures of movement and memory, which respectively capture how class positions differ from one generation to the next and how the influence of class origins dissipates across generations. Applying these methods to data from the U.S., we find that overall levels of movement and memory have remained largely stable across cohorts born between 1945 and 1990. This stability, however, masks offsetting class-specific trends. Among those from the upper and lower classes, movement has declined and memory has increased. In contrast, among the middle classes, movement has risen and memory has weakened.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much do people dislike opportunities they have never been exposed to, and why? We study how exposure affects work location decisions of casual workers. We offer short-term employment and randomize training locations to induce novel exposures. Participants sacrifice 22% of the median daily wage to avoid working in a location never visited before; one hour-long visit eliminates this premium. Workers anticipate two thirds of the effect exposure has on their later preferences. Results are most consistent with perceived fixed costs of exposure rather than sorting or quality uncertainty. Unfamiliar neighborhoods are also less likely to enter workers' consideration sets.</content>

    <title>Indebted Supply and Monetary Policy: A Theory of Financial Dominance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a New Keynesian model with financial frictions to study how corporate capital structure shapes static and dynamic monetary policy tradeoffs through the supply side. Ex post, when corporate leverage is high, monetary tightening contracts both demand and supply. As a result, the Phillips curve is highly non-linear and state-dependent, and the “natural rate” Rⁿ ensuring price stability increases with corporate leverage. Yet the tradeoff between inflation targeting and tightening supply constraints implies that the optimal ex-post policy is to set a rate Rᵒᵖᵗ &lt; Rⁿ that can decrease with leverage. Ex ante, firms’ market-timing incentives lead them to increase leverage when rates are low, which creates an intertemporal tradeoff: monetary easing supports current demand but hurts future supply, which makes easing partially self-defeating. The optimal ex-ante monetary policy features a prudential motive for leaning against leverage even when the divine coincidence holds in the current period.</content>

    <title>Contract Design and Insurance Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce experimental variation in the insurance contracts offered to rice farmers in China to study how contract design affects insurance takeup. We compare a single-contract offering with menus that include multiple contracts differing in premiums and payouts. Expanding the contract menu substantially increases take-up, primarily through higher adoption of the basic, lowest-cost contract. Additional experimental variation in relative prices and information provision shows that these effects are driven by context effects arising from relative price comparisons within the menu, rather than information inference. The findings highlight contract menu design as an effective supply-side tool for expanding insurance coverage.</content>

    <title>The H-1B Wage Gap, Visa Fees, and Employer Demand</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The H-1B program lets firms hire high-skill foreign workers for a six-year term. The annual number of visas allocated to for-profit firms is capped at 85,000 and there is excess demand for those visas. The analysis merges data from the Labor Condition Application where firms attest that H-1B hires do not adversely impact natives, the I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker where firms request to hire a specific person, and the American Community Surveys. On average, H-1B workers earn 16 percent less than comparable natives. The payroll savings suggest that firms may be willing to pay a one-time fee to obtain an H-1B visa. The data are examined using a labor demand model to simulate how a fee alters the hiring decision. Depending on the level of excess demand, the unobserved productivity gains or costs from an H-1B hire, and the rate of job separations, the revenue-maximizing fee is between $118,000 and $264,000, has little or no impact on the number of H-1Bs hired, and generates between $6.2 and $22.4 billion in revenues. The fee would also change the skill composition of the H-1B workforce, making it more skilled.</content>

    <title>American Investment in Chinese Renminbi</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses microdata on U.S. mutual fund and ETF portfolios from SEC Form NPORT to study American investment in Chinese Renminbi (RMB)–denominated bonds. We show that, even as total foreign holdings of Chinese bonds rebounded in 2024, U.S. holdings of RMB bonds fell sharply and that most of this decline reflects funds exiting RMB positions entirely. These patterns point to a shift in the composition of China’s foreign investor base away from U.S. institutional investors and illustrate how publicly available microdata can inform work on international currency use.</content>

    <title>Is Immigration Good for Health? The Effect of Immigration on Older Adult Mortality in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the impact of increased immigration on mortality among elderly Americans, who rely on the immigrant-intensive health and long-term care sectors. Using a shift-share approach we find a strong impact of immigration on the size of the immigrant care workforce: admitting 1,000 new immigrants would lead to 142 new foreign healthcare workers, without evidence of crowd out of native health care workers. We also find striking effects on mortality: a 25% increase in the steady state flow of immigrants to the US would result in 5,000 fewer deaths nationwide. We identify reduced use of nursing homes as a key mechanism driving this result.</content>

    <title>The Economic Impact of Mass Deportations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies the effects of large-scale deportations on wages, prices, and real incomes in the United States. We impute the legal status for each worker in the American Community Survey by combining detailed individual information with group-level visa records. In 2024, 3.2% of US workers were unauthorized, but some regions and sectors were heavily dependent on unauthorized immigrant labor. We develop a dynamic quantitative framework with multiple regions, sectors and occupations, heterogeneous workers, and endogenous capital accumulation to study the economic impacts of removing unauthorized workers. We derive analytical expressions relating region- and occupation-specific real wages and sectoral relative prices to changes in the supply of immigrant workers, observable factor shares, and combinations of structural elasticities. Following the removal of 50% of unauthorized immigrants, in the short run average native real wages rise 0.15% nationally, driven by an increase in the capital-labor ratio. In the long run, however, native real wages fall in every state, and by 0.33% nationally, as capital gets decumulated in response to a lower population. Consumer prices in the sectors intensive in unauthorized workers – such as Farming – rise by about 1% relative to the price of the average consumption basket, while most other sectors experience negligible relative price changes.</content>

    <title>Geopolitics in the Evaluation of International Scientific Collaboration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides evidence that geopolitical considerations systematically shape funding evaluations of international collaboration proposals. We examine this dynamic in the consequential context of U.S.–China collaboration. Across two large-scale randomized experiments with U.S. policymakers and U.S.-based scientists, we find substantial and consistent penalties for proposals involving China-based collaborators. Policymakers express much greater unconditional support for proposals with Germany-based collaborators than for otherwise identical proposals with China-based collaborators (68% vs. 28%). Crucially, this penalty is not confined to policymakers: scientists themselves exhibit a sizeable 18 percentage-point gap (48% vs. 30%), despite professional expectations of merit-based evaluation. Much of the difference reflects a shift from unconditional to conditional approval rather than outright rejection. These penalties are remarkably consistent across scientific fields and respondent characteristics, with little evidence of heterogeneity, indicating that they reflect geopolitical rather than domain-specific concerns. Overall, the findings suggest that geopolitics influences gatekeeping judgments in government funding, with broad implications for peer review, scientific norms, and the future of international collaboration in an era of intensifying geopolitical competition.</content>

    <title>Protest Matters: The Effects of Protests on Economic Redistribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can citizen-led protests lead to meaningful economic redistribution and nudge governments to increase redistributive fiscal transfers? We study the effects of protests on fiscal redistribution using evidence from Nigeria. We digitized twenty-six years of public finance data from 1988 to 2016 to examine the effects of protests on intergovernmental transfers. We find that protests increase transfers to protesting regions, but only in areas that are politically aligned with disbursing governments. Evidence from the large-scale 2012 Occupy Nigeria protests confirms these results. Protesters also face increased police violence, particularly in non-aligned regions. The results show that protests can influence fiscal redistribution.</content>

    <title>Heaven or Earth? The Evolving Role of Global Shocks for Domestic Monetary Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business cycles are increasingly driven by global shocks, rather than the domestic demand shocks prominent in earlier decades, posing challenges for central banks seeking to meet domestic mandates and communicate their policy decisions. This paper analyzes the evolving influence and characteristics of global and domestic shocks in advanced economies from 1970-2024 using a new FAVAR model that decomposes movements in interest rates, inflation, and output growth into four global shocks (demand, supply, oil, and monetary policy) and three domestic shocks (demand, supply, and monetary policy). We find that the role of global shocks has increased sharply over time and that their characteristics differ from those of domestic shocks across multiple dimensions. Compared to domestic shocks, global shocks have a larger supply component, higher variance, more persistent effects on inflation, and are more asymmetric (contributing more to tightening than to easing phases of monetary policy). As global supply shocks have become more prominent, central banks have also been less willing to “look through” their effects on inflation than for comparable domestic shocks. The distinct characteristics and rising influence of global shocks—particularly global supply shocks—have significant implications for modeling monetary policy and designing central bank frameworks.</content>

    <title>Are Government Bonds Safe in Times of War and Pandemic?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze real returns on U.S. and U.K. government debt during major wars and the COVID-19 pandemic over the past three centuries. Wars are associated with sharply negative real returns on outstanding government debt, with returns falling far below economic growth, in contrast to peacetime periods when returns exceed growth. Elevated surprise inflation and financial repression account for a cumulative 31% wedge between returns and growth over four years of war, implying that bondholders bear a substantial share of wartime fiscal costs. During wartime, government bonds also systematically underperform risky assets.</content>
