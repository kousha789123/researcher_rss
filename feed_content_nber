    <title>Campaigning for Extinction: Eradication of Sparrows and the Great Famine in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do large disruptions to ecosystems affect human well-being? This paper tests the long-standing hypothesis that China's 1958 Four Pests Campaign, which exterminated sparrows despite scientists’ warnings about their pest-control role, exacerbated the Great Famine—the largest in human history. Combining newly digitized data on historical agricultural productivity in China with habitat suitability modeling methods in ecology, we find that, after sparrow eradication, a one-standard-deviation increase in sparrow suitability led to 5.3% larger rice and 8.7% larger wheat declines. State food procurement exacerbated these losses, resulting in a 9.6% higher mortality in high-suitability counties—implying nearly two million excess deaths.</content>

    <title>Retail Investors’ Contrarian Behavior Around News, Attention, and the Momentum Effect</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large and representative panel of U.S. brokerage accounts, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and that such contrarian trading contributes to price momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD).  We show that extreme return streaks and surprises are not enough for stocks to exhibit PEAD and momentum and that the intensity of contrarian retail trading plays a key role: the PEAD of loser stocks with bad earnings surprises becomes increasingly more negative as retail buying pressure increases, and he PEAD of the stocks with the highest past returns and largest earnings surprises is the most positive for the stocks with the biggest net retail outflow. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. Younger and more attentive individuals are more likely to be contrarian, and a firm’s dividend yield, leverage, size, book to market, and analyst coverage are associated with the fraction of contrarian trades they face around earnings announcements.  The disposition effect and stale limit orders, while present in our sample, do not explain our results. Our findings are consistent with investors’ conservatism, sticky beliefs, and cognitive uncertainty, as well as an incorrect belief in the Law of Small Numbers.</content>

    <title>Entrepreneurial Experimentation Design for Venture Finance</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how entrepreneurs strategically design experiments to convince venture capitalists (VCs) to fund their projects when investors interpret data through heterogeneous statistical frameworks. Drawing on Liang (2021)'s model of games with incomplete information played by statistical learners, we translate her abstract theoretical framework into a practical venture capital setting. We characterise how entrepreneurs balance funding plausibility against equity dilution by strategically choosing experiments along two critical dimensions: sample size (precision) and dimensionality (breadth of metrics). Our analysis reveals that for genuinely high-quality projects, increased precision helps by forcing VC beliefs to converge toward true quality. For low-quality projects, funding depends on preserving disagreement through sparse, high-dimensional experiments. The entrepreneur's optimal design depends critically on their prior beliefs: confident entrepreneurs choose high-precision, low-dimensional experiments that minimise equity dilution, while uncertain entrepreneurs opt for sparse, high-dimensional experiments that maximise the probability some VC will hold sufficiently optimistic beliefs. The framework provides a rigorous foundation for understanding how entrepreneurs and investors can rationally disagree when observing identical evidence, with significant implications for strategic information design in entrepreneurial settings.</content>

    <title>Implications of Fiscal-Monetary Interaction from HANK Models</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I describe nine implications of the interconnectedness of fiscal and monetary policy that surface in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models. Not all are unique to HANK models. (i) Long run fiscal changes force monetary adjustments. (ii) Sustainable permanent deficits are feasible. (iii) Monetary policy leaves fiscal footprints, even with passive fiscal policy. (iv) Fewer controversies around active fiscal policy. (v) Equilibria are unique under a wider class of fiscal and monetary rules. (vi) With short-term debt, raising nominal rates without a fiscal contraction raises inflation. (vii) Unfunded fiscal stimulus is more inflationary. (viii) Even fully funded fiscal stimulus is inflationary. (ix) Fiscal transfers can substitute for monetary policy in the aggregate.</content>

    <title>Misperceptions About Air Pollution: Implications for Willingness to Pay and Environmental Inequality</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether misperceptions about air pollution contribute to environmental inequality in the United States. We use a two-part survey experiment to elicit respondents' beliefs about local air quality and pollution's effects on life expectancy. We document how misperception differs across demographic groups and then how this misperception affects willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. Since misperception or beliefs may be correlated with other unobservable determinants of WTP, we randomly show selected participants customized information about their actual air pollution. This allows us to trace out how experimentally induced changes in beliefs affect WTP for air quality. Our results suggest significant misperceptions about air pollution in the US. Respondents, on average, overestimate both their air pollution exposure and its impact on life expectancy. Beliefs about relative air pollution are not systematically biased but are noisy. Despite some differences in misperceptions between Black and White respondents, counterfactual exercises do not suggest that rectifying these misperceptions would meaningfully close the observed gap in WTP and/or pollution exposure.</content>

    <title>Fear and Risk Perception: Understanding Physicians' Dynamic Responses to Malpractice Lawsuits</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Hanming Fang, Ming Li &amp; Jia Xiang</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how physicians adjust their clinical decision-making following medical malpractice lawsuits and how these responses are driven by mental rather than ﬁnancial costs, and do not align with rational expectations. We combine a comprehensive health insurance claim database from a Chinese city with the universe of malpractice lawsuits to study changes in physician behavior and patient outcomes. We ﬁnd that physicians respond to lawsuits by practicing more conservatively, rejecting high-risk patients, reducing surgery rates, and increasing the use of diagnostic tests and traditional Chinese medicine. These changes are associated with worse patient outcomes, consistent with defensive medicine. The eﬀects are not limited to the directly involved departments but spill over to other departments within the same hospital. In addition, the changes are short-lived, with physicians reverting to their pre-lawsuit treatment patterns in eight weeks. We provide evidence that such responses are likely driven by mental cost (including fear) and deviate from rational expectations. First, physicians in hospitals with more and less frequent lawsuits exhibit similar responses to a new lawsuit; moreover, they respond similarly to winning and losing cases. Second, physicians’ reactions to a patient’s death vary depending on the recency of a salient lawsuit. Lastly, physician responses are especially strong following criminal violence against physicians, which is emotionally and psychologically salient.</content>

    <title>Concentration and Markups in International Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper derives a closed-form expression linking aggregate markups on imported inputs to concentration in a model of firm-to-firm trade with two-sided market power. Our theory extends standard oligopoly insights in two dimensions. First, it reveals that markups increase with exporter concentration and decrease with importer concentration, reflecting the balance of oligopoly and oligopsony forces. Second, it adapts conventional market definitions to reflect rigid trading relationships, yielding new concentration measures that capture competition in firm-to-firm trade. Analysis of Colombian transaction-level import data shows these differences are key to understanding markup dynamics in international trade.</content>

    <title>Random Walk Forecasts of Stationary Processes Have Low Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the use of a misspecified overdifferenced model to forecast the level of a stationary scalar time series. Let x(t) be the series, and let bias be the sample average of a series of forecast errors. Then, the bias of forecasts of x(t) generated by a misspecified overdifferenced ARMA model for Δx(t) will tend to be smaller in magnitude than the bias of forecasts of x(t) generated by a correctly specified model for x(t). Formally, let P be the number of forecasts. The bias from the model for Δx(t) has a variance that is O(1/P^2), while the variance of the bias from the model for x(t) generally is O(1/P). With a driftless random walk as our baseline overdifferenced model, we confirm this theoretical result with simulations and empirical work: random walk bias is generally one-tenth to one-half that of an appropriately specified model fit to levels.</content>

    <title>Market Rents and CPI Shelter Inflation</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research finds that the shelter component of CPI inflation responds with a lag to movements in market rents—the rents that tenants pay when they move into a new dwelling. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of this fact. We start by identifying three sources of lags between market rents and CPI shelter: the rents of most tenants are set in long-term leases; rents are smoothed for continuing tenants who renew leases; and CPI shelter inflation is measured with rent changes over six months. We incorporate these lags in a model of shelter inflation and compare the model to monthly data since 2015, using the Zillow Observed Rent Index to measure market rents. We find that the model performs fairly well, suggesting that it may be useful for understanding and forecasting inflation.</content>

    <title>Do Environmental Markets Improve Allocative Efficiency? Evidence from U.S. Air Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The central appeal of environmental markets – efficient allocation of emission reductions – has been difficult to establish empirically. We develop a framework linking the theoretical change in allocative efficiency following a market-based policy to a quasi-experimental estimator. We apply this framework with administrative data to two major U.S. air pollution markets. We find allocative efficiency for pollution improved by 3.3 percentage points annually under California’s RECLAIM program but do not detect a change under the U.S.’ NOx Budget Trading Program. These results are supported by greater heterogeneity in baseline facility characteristics under RECLAIM and differences in program implementation.</content>

    <title>Markups and Cost Pass-through Along the Supply Chain</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a novel dataset of production costs, wholesale prices, and retail prices from a large global manufacturer to study markups and pricing behavior along the supply chain. We document several facts about markups covering the period July 2018 through June 2023, and we propose a model of supply chain pricing behavior that rationalizes key pat-terns in our data. We find substantial dispersion in markups across products at each supply chain level. Manufacturer and retail markups are negatively correlated in the cross section and over time. Despite time-series variation in firm-level markups, total markups—reflecting the relationship between retail prices and production costs—are stable over time, even when prices increased along with inflation in the United States in 2022. We apply our model to quantify factors that determine relative bargaining power between the manufacturer and retailers, leveraging variation across countries, products, and time. Finally, we consider the dynamics of cost pass-through and the mediating role of manufacturer-retailer bargaining in price dynamics, with implications for current policy debates, including trade policy and tariffs.</content>

    <title>The Social Lifecycle Impacts of Power Plant Siting in the Historical United States</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relative contributions of siting decisions and post-siting demo-graphic shifts to current disparities in exposure to polluting fossil-fuel plants in the United States. Our analysis leverages newly digitized data on power plant siting and operations from 1900-2020, combined with spatially resolved demographics and population data from the U.S Census from 1870-2020. We find little evidence that fossil-fuel plants were disproportionately sited in counties with higher Black population shares on average. However, event study estimates indicate that Black population share grows in the decades after the first fossil-fuel plant is built in a county, with average increases in Black population share of 4 percentage points in the 50-70 years after first siting. These long-run demographic shifts are driven by counties that first hosted a fossil-fuel plant between 1900-1949. We close by exploring how these long-run demographic shifts were shaped by the Great Migration, differential sorting in response to pollution, and other factors. Our findings highlight that the equity implications of siting long-lived infrastructure can differ dramatically depending on the time span considered.</content>

    <title>Optimal Tariffs with Geopolitical Alignment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As geopolitical tensions intensify, great powers often turn to trade policy to influence international alignment. We examine the optimal design of tariffs in a world where large countries care not only about economic welfare but also about the political allegiance of smaller states. We consider both a unipolar setting, where a single hegemon uses preferential trade agreements to attract partners, and a bipolar world, where two great powers compete for influence. In both scenarios, we derive optimal tariffs that balance terms-of-trade considerations with strategic incentives to encourage political alignment. We find that when geopolitical concerns are active, the optimal tariff exceeds the classic Mill-Bickerdike level. In a bipolar world, optimal tariffs reflect both economic and political rivalry, and may be strategic complements or substitutes. A calibration exercise using U.N. voting patterns, an estimate of the cost of buying votes in the U.N., and military spending suggests that geopolitical motives can significantly amplify protectionist pressures and that the emergence of a second great power can contribute to a retreat from globalization.</content>

    <title>The Legacy of High Inflation on Monetary Policy Rules</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows the key, yet overlooked, role played by the legacy of a high inflation history on the strength of the monetary policy response to inflationary shocks. To rationalize this, we propose a New Keynesian model that diverges from the existing workhorse model by adding path-dependence (to a forward-looking model) and potentially imperfect central bank credibility. We show that achieving low inflation (hitting the target) requires more aggressive monetary policy reactions, and is costlier from an output point of view, when individuals’ past inflationary experiences shape their inflation expectation formation. In turn, we provide empirical evidence of the need for these two theoretical additions. Countries that experienced a high level of inflation before adopting the IT regime tend to respond more aggressively to deviations of inflation expectations from the central bank’s target. We also point to the existence of a credibility puzzle, whereby the strength of a central bank’s monetary policy response to deviations from the inflation target remains broadly unchanged even as central banks gain credibility over time. Put differently, a country’s inflationary past casts a long and persistent shadow on central banks.</content>

    <title>Are Juries Racially Discriminatory? Evidence from the Race-Blind Charging of Grand Jury Defendants with and without Racially Distinctive Names</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We implement five different tests of whether grand juries, which are drawn from a representative cross-section of the public, discriminate against Black defendants when deciding to prosecute felony cases. Three tests exploit that while jurors do not directly observe defendant race, jurors do observe the “Blackness” of defendants’ names. All three tests—an audit-study-style test, a traditional outcome-based test, and a test that estimates racial bias using blinded/unblinded comparisons after purging omitted variable bias—indicate juries do not discriminate based on race. Two additional tests indicate racial bias explains at most 0.3 percent of the Black-White felony conviction gap.</content>

    <title>Sequential College Admission Mechanisms and Off-Platform Options</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The optimal functioning of centralized allocation systems is undermined by the presence of institutions operating off-platform—a feature common to virtually all real-world implementations. These off-platform options generate justified envy, as students may reject their centralized assignment in favor of an outside offer, leaving vacant seats in programs that others would have preferred to their current match. We examine whether sequential assignment procedures can mitigate this inefficiency: they allow students to delay their enrollment decision to potentially receive a better offer later, at the cost of waiting before knowing their final admission outcome. To quantify this trade-off, we estimate a dynamic model of application and acceptance decisions using rich administrative data from the French college admission system, which include rank-ordered lists and waiting decisions. We find that waiting costs are large. Yet, by improving students’ assignment outcomes relative to a standard single-round system, the sequential mechanism decreases the share of students who leave the higher education system without a degree by 5.4% and leads to large welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Seemingly Virtuous Complexity in Return Prediction</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Return prediction with Random Fourier Features (RFF)—a very large number, P , of nonlinear trans-formations of a small number, K, of predictor variables—has become popular recently. Surprisingly, this approach appears to yield a successful out-of-sample stock market index timing strategy even when trained in rolling windows as small as T = 12 months with P in the thousands. However, when P ≫ T , the RFF-based forecast becomes a weighted average of the T training sample returns, with weights determined by the similarity between the predictor vectors in the training data and the current predictor vector. In short training windows, similarity primarily reflects temporal proximity, so the forecast reduces to a recency-weighted average of the T return observations in the training data—essentially a momentum strategy. Moreover, because similarity declines with predictor volatility, the result is a volatility-timed momentum strategy. The strong performance of the RFF-based strategy thus stems not from its ability to extract predictive signals from the training data, but from the fact that a volatility-timed momentum strategy happened to perform well in historical data. This point becomes clear when applying the same method to artificial data in which returns exhibit reversals rather than momentum: the RFF approach still constructs the same volatility-timed momentum strategy, which then performs poorly.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel methodology for detecting inflation turning points that com-bines high-frequency, disaggregated price data with standard structural break techniques to provide policymakers with more timely and precise signals of inflation dynamics. The methodology consists of three key components: measuring inflation as the slope of the log price index rather than using conventional inflation rates, employing structural break techniques to detect shifts in this slope, and leveraging highly disaggregated price indexes to identify trend breaks at a granular level. We apply this approach to study two critical recent episodes: Argentina’s 2024–2025 disinflation and the inflationary impact of U.S. tariff adjustments in 2025. For Argentina, we detect a broad-based disinflationary turning point in May 2024. For the U.S., we find evidence of a turning point in February 2025, with significant sectoral inflation accelerations despite stable aggregate inflation measures. These applications demonstrate the utility of our approach for enhancing real-time inflation monitoring and policy decision-making.</content>

    <title>Why Did Air Conditioning Adoption Accelerate Faster Than Predicted? Evidence from Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common theme in the vast literature on climate change is the estimation of models using historical data to make predictions many decades into the future. Although there is a large and growing number of these types of studies, researchers rarely return later to check the accuracy of their predictions. In this paper, we perform such an exercise. In Davis and Gertler (2015), we used household-level microdata from Mexico to predict future air conditioning adoption as a function of income and temperature. Revisiting these predictions with 12 years of additional data, we find that air conditioning in Mexico has accelerated, significantly exceeding our predictions. Neither errors in predicting income growth or rising temperatures, nor migration patterns, nor an overly restrictive model can explain the large prediction gap. Instead, our results point to the failure to account for falling electricity prices and technological changes in air conditioner eﬀiciency as key drivers of the prediction gap.</content>

    <title>GenAI Misinformation, Trust, and News Consumption: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how AI-generated misinformation affects demand for trustworthy news, using data from a field experiment by a major German outlet, Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ). Readers were randomly assigned to a treatment highlighting the challenge of distinguishing real from AI-generated images. The treatment raised concern with misinformation (0.3 s.d.) and reduced trust in news (0.1 s.d.), including SZ. Importantly, it affected post-survey browsing behavior: daily visits to SZ digital content rose by 2.5% in the immediate aftermath of the treatment. Moreover, we find that subscriber retention increased by 1.1% after five months, corresponding to about a one-third drop in attrition rate. Results are consistent with a model where the relative value of trustworthy news sources increases with the prevalence of misinformation, which may thus boost engagement with those sources even while lowering trust in news content.</content>

    <title>When is Less More? Bank Arrangements for Liquidity vs Central Bank Support</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory suggests that in the face of fire sale externalities, banks have incentives to overinvest in order to issue excessive money-like deposit liabilities. The existence of a private market for insurance such as contingent capital can eliminate the overinvestment incentives, leading to efficient outcomes. However, it does not eliminate fire sales. A central bank that can infuse liquidity cheaply may be motivated to intervene in the face of fire sales. If so, it can crowd out the private market and, if liquidity intervention is not priced at higher-than-breakeven rates, induce overinvestment. We examine various forms of public intervention to identify the least distortionary ones. Our analysis helps understand the historical prevalence of private insurance in the era preceding central banks and deposit insurance, their subsequent disappearance, as well as the continuing incidence of banking crises and speculative excesses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intermediary asset pricing posits that financial institutions are important players in financial markets, and that their decisions shape asset prices beyond simply reflecting the preferences of the average household in the economy. We explain how the intermediary-asset pricing approach helps make sense of empirical patterns in the data: the excess volatility of asset prices, differences in price movements across asset classes, the cross section of expected returns within asset classes, and specific arbitrages and price dislocations. We also review how this view of price fluctuations has important implications for macroeconomic dynamics, international economics, and policy. In particular, the role of financial regulation and monetary policy in alleviating constraints or removing risk from intermediary balance sheets during periods of stress is central in this approach. We highlight both existing progress and gaps for future research.</content>

    <title>Why Does Value-Added Work? Implications of a Dynamic Model of Student Achievement</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Non-experimental value-added models have been shown to yield forecast-unbiased estimates of teacher and school effects.  To investigate, we propose a dynamic state-space model of knowledge accumulation, in which test scores are imperfect measures of knowledge, and students receive temporary and persistent shocks to their stock of knowledge each period.  The model identifies two primary sources of bias: transient factors in baseline scores (measurement error or transitory effects of prior teachers) and heterogeneous student growth rates.  We propose diagnostic tests and corrections for each.  Using eleven years of data from North Carolina, we find little evidence of heterogeneous student growth.  Rather, the primary source of bias is attenuation of the baseline coefficient, which opens the door to selection on correlates of true baseline knowledge.  Although conventional value-added estimates are biased for individual teachers due to attenuation, we find they are forecast unbiased when applied across a sample of teachers, due to the offsetting relationship between bias and teachers’ true effectiveness.  When achievement follows the state-space model and there is no heterogeneity in growth rates, the attenuation-corrected value-added model (ACVAM) should yield unbiased estimates of a wide range educational interventions, not just teachers and schools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and estimate a spatial search-and-bargaining model to study the role of intermediaries and spatial frictions using data from the used-car market. We find that dealers earn price premiums by leveraging three key advantages: selective acquisition of higher-quality cars, superior matching efficiency, and greater bargaining power. Counterfactual simulations reveal that selective intermediation and spatial segmentation significantly affect market efficiency and consumer welfare. While dealers extract more surplus per transaction than sellers, policies reducing dealers' advantages increase search frictions and lower overall welfare. Counterintuitively, reducing spatial frictions harms consumers by shifting trade to less efficient private-seller channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of climate change and mitigation-related employment changes on U.S. politics. We combine 2000-2020 precinct-level voting information and congressional candidate positions on environmental policy with high-resolution temperature, precipitation, and census block-group level measures of “green” and “brown” employment shares. Holding politician positions fixed within a district, we find that Democratic vote shares increase with exogenous changes in local climate and green transition employment. We embed these estimates into a model of political competition, including both direct and demand-driven effects of shocks on candidate supply of climate policy positions. Incorporating these estimates into 2022-2050 projections of climate change and green employment transition, we find that voting for the Democratic Party increases, while both parties move slightly to the right on climate policy. Under worst-case climate projections and current mitigation trajectories, our estimates indicate that the probability the House passes a carbon-pricing bill is 9 percentage points higher in 2050 than in 2020.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platforms, retailers, and other firms often offer their own products alongside products sold by competitors. We study the effects of this practice by combining a field experiment that hides brands owned by Amazon (i.e., private labels) from shoppers on Amazon.com with model-based counterfactuals and welfare analysis.  In the absence of private labels, consumers substitute toward products that are similar along most observable dimensions. Removing Amazon brands does not change consumers' search effort or their propensity to shop at other retail websites. Despite the ample availability of observably similar alternatives, our welfare estimates imply that, for the categories we study, removing Amazon brands would reduce consumer surplus by 5.5 percent in the short run, with approximately 10 percent of the impact due to equilibrium price increases by other sellers. The effects are heterogeneous, with consumer surplus reductions exceeding 10 percent in some categories, while other categories realize much smaller decreases when Amazon brands are removed. Demoting private labels in search results to counteract potential self-preferencing does not lead to gains in consumer surplus. This outcome arises because a subset of consumers derive greater utility from private labels and benefit from their high placement in search results.</content>

    <title>Control Without Ownership: Governance of Nonprofit Hospitals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of the governance structures of nonprofit hospitals and hospital systems. We study both the internal governance mechanisms (boards of directors, incentive contracts) and external mechanisms (market for corporate control, government oversight), with particular focus on the latter. Nonprofit boards are unusually large, include employee directors, exhibit less industry expertise among outside directors, and face weak external oversight. CEO pay and turnover are largely unresponsive to non-financial metrics such as quality or charity provision. The disciplinary role of the market for corporate control is also weaker in the nonprofit sector: nonprofits with poor financial performance are half as likely to be acquired or closed as for-profits, and weak performance on non-financial metrics has no effect on acquisitions or closures. Using time-series and cross-sectional variation in state oversight of nonprofits, we find that oversight strength explains a substantial portion of the gap in takeover rates between for-profits and nonprofits. We conclude that nonprofit governance structures lack the attributes traditionally associated with “good governance.”</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study an intervention by a brokerage firm providing advisory services to high-net-worth investors. In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows that by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information, financial firms can successfully reduce their clients’ biases.</content>

    <title>Can Cash Transfers Save Lives? Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment in Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the impacts of large-scale unconditional cash transfers on child survival. One-time transfers of USD 1000 were provided to over 10,500 poor households across 653 randomized villages in Kenya. We collected census data on over 100,000 births, including on mortality and cause of death, and detailed data on household health behaviors. Unconditional cash transfers (accounting for spillovers) lead to 48% fewer infant deaths before age one and 45% fewer child deaths before age five. Detailed data on cause of death, transfer timing relative to birth, and the location of health facilities indicate that unconditional cash transfers and access to delivery care are complements in generating mortality reductions: the largest gains are estimated in neonatal and maternal causes of death largely preventable by appropriate obstetric care and among households living close to physician-staffed facilities and those who receive the transfer around the time of birth, and treatment leads to a large increase in hospital deliveries (by 45%). The infant and child mortality declines are concentrated among poorer households with below median assets or predicted consumption. The transfers also result in a substantial decline of 51% in female labor supply in the three months before and the three months after a birth, and improved child nutrition. Infant and child mortality largely revert to pre-program levels after cash transfers end. Despite not being the main aim of the original program, we show that unconditional cash transfers in this setting may be a cost-effective way to reduce infant and child deaths.</content>

    <title>Information Frictions and the Labor Market for Public School Teachers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information frictions—where a worker and her current employer know more about the worker’s productivity than prospective employers—have complex equity-efficiency implications in the teacher labor market. Reducing information frictions may make it easier for effective teachers to move to their preferred schools and increase cross-school inequality, but it may also attract high-quality entrants and improve market-level teacher quality. Taking these factors into account, we develop an equilibrium model of the teacher labor market and estimate it using data from the Houston Independent School District, which launched a transparent teacher evaluation system in 2011. Counterfactual simulations reveal that (1) making district teachers’ quality observable to all district schools improves average teacher quality at the district level and in the top and bottom quartiles of schools ranked by student performance, while decreasing it in other schools; (2) budget-neutral bonus programs that incentivize high-quality teachers to teach in low-performing schools can increase overall teacher quality and reduce cross-school inequalities; and (3) these programs are more effective in markets with cross-employer information symmetry.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study deforestation in a dynamic world trade system. We first document that between 1990-2020: (i) global forest area has decreased by 7.1 percent, with large heterogeneity across countries, (ii) deforestation is associated with expansions of agricultural land use, (iii) deforestation is larger in countries with a comparative advantage in agriculture, and (iv) population growth causes deforestation. Motivated by these facts, we build a model in which structural change and comparative advantage determine the extent, location, and timing of deforestation. Using the model, we obtain conditions under which reductions in trade costs and tariffs reduce global deforestation. Quantitatively, eliminating global agricultural tariffs has limited impacts on global forest area, leads to substantial forest reallocation across countries, and results in net welfare benefits</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study voting in general elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Our data set includes demographics and turnout of all registered voters for the years 2016–2020, as well as vote shares at the precinct and contest level. We estimate a Downsian voting model incorporating rich observed and unobserved heterogeneity at the voter and contest level. We find that voters with high perceived voting costs tend to favor Democrats, as do marginal voters in most districts. Variation in state voting policies accounts for a modest share of overall estimated voting costs but is sufficient to determine the majority party in some years. We also find that many states’ district maps favor one party in converting votes to seats. On net, these biases favor Republicans. For example, we estimate that winning 50% of votes in every state would give Republicans a nine percentage point seat advantage in the House.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Borrowers’ use of cashless payments improves their access to capital from FinTech lenders and predicts a lower probability of default. These relationships are stronger for cashless technologies providing more precise information, and for outflows. Cashless payment usage complements other signals of borrower quality. We rationalize these empirical findings using a framework in which borrowers signal their lower likelihood of diverting cash flows through payment technology choice, and screening accuracy is further strengthened by informational complementarities. The informational synergy we uncover provides a rationale for the joint rise of cashless payments and FinTech lending, as well as for open banking.</content>

    <title>Has the Rise of Work from Home Reduced the Motherhood Penalty in the Labor Market?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When women become mothers, they often take a step back from their careers.  Could work from home (WFH) reduce this motherhood penalty, particularly in traditionally family-unfriendly careers? We leverage technological changes prior to the pandemic that increased the feasibility of WFH in some college degrees but not others. In degrees where WFH increased, motherhood gaps in employment narrowed: for every 10% increase in WFH, mothers’ employment rates increased by 0.78 per centage points (or 0.94%) relative to other women’s. This change is driven by majors linked to careers that have high returns to hours and inflexible demands on workers’ time. We microfound these results using panel data that show that women who could WFH before childbirth are less likely to exit the workforce.</content>

    <title>A Model of the Babbage Firm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a unified model of the cognitive division of labour in a knowledge economy.  Building on recent frameworks for knowledge creation and decision making under uncertainty, it distinguishes between specialists, who engage in costly “on the spot” reasoning to generate tacit knowledge around a focal point, and generalists, who search for and interpolate existing knowledge but deliver answers subject to error.  The model characterises how these two types of workers should be allocated across a continuum of questions, given the location of codified knowledge points and the distribution of problems.  It shows that optimal task assignment depends on the cognitive process through which information is processed rather than on skill endowments or task complexity.  When specialists operate around both knowledge points, their allocation is shaped by their absolute advantage over generalists, leading to non‐contiguous specialist domains interspersed with generalist regions.  When specialists cluster around a single point, a natural boundary emerges between specialist and generalist domains that shifts but persists despite changes in question distribution.  Extending the analysis to a two‐period setting, the paper identifies when specialists should sacrifice static efficiency to codify their tacit discoveries, creating bridges that allow generalists to operate more effectively in the future.  These results provide a formal microfoundation for Babbage’s insights into the division of cognitive labour and offer predictions about how knowledge work responds to changes in the knowledge environment, the distribution of questions, and the patience of capital.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the Great Gatsby curve that connects inequality to mobility, using panel data spanning several countries and time periods. Existing literature observes that the intergenerational elasticity of earnings falls as inequality rises, implying that mobility (viewed as the negative of that elasticity) is negatively correlated with inequality. In sharp contrast, we show that measures of upward mobility, axiomatically aligned with progressivity in income growth rates, are robustly and positively associated with baseline inequality. While there is no contradiction here, our study highlights crucial differences between mobility measures based on (lower) persistence and those based on growth progressivity, and asks the reader to align their choice of measure with foundational criteria that they feel best describe “mobility". Our findings offer a re-interpretation of the Gatsby curve through the lens of shared prosperity, and have implications for the evolution of inequality within countries.</content>

    <title>Creative Financing and Public Moral Hazard: Evidence from Medicaid and the Nursing Home Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the misallocation of Medicaid funds, its consequences for reimbursement rates, the quantity, and the quality of care provided. Combining two decades of administrative, audit, and survey data on U.S. nursing homes, we show that states employ creative financing schemes to divert federal matching funds from their intended purposes. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that, to increase federal matching funds, such schemes distort the quality-quantity tradeoff. In Indiana, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the rollout of a creative financing scheme, we find a disproportionate expansion of Medicaid-funded care for dementia patients in the lowest-quality nursing facilities.</content>

    <title>Tariffs and State Capacity: A Specific Example</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Evasion is a key obstacle to raising customs revenue. We study how improved administrative capacity enables governments to combat evasion by redesigning tariff codes. Using newly compiled historical records from the Early American Republic, we show that as Customs administration matured, the tariff code became more complex and more reliant on specific (quantity-based) tariffs in preference to ad valorem (value-based) ones.  We develop an equilibrium model of tariff administration with costly verification of declared values that explains these twin trends: Administrative capacity allows Customs officials to disaggregate goods and assess tailored specific tariffs, obviating misvaluation while minimizing price distortions.  The model successfully predicts several additional empirical patterns: Specific tariffs tend to be assessed on goods that are homogeneous, cheap, or lightly taxed.</content>

    <title>The Global Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The extent to which women participate in the labor market varies greatly across the globe. If such differences reflect distortions that women face in accessing good jobs, they can reduce economic activity through a misallocation of talent. In this paper, we build on Hsieh et al. (2019) to provide a methodology to quantify these productivity consequences. The index we propose, the ”Global Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)”, measures the losses in aggregate productivity that gender-based misallocation imposes. Our index allows us to separately identify labor demand distortions (e.g., discrimination in hiring for formal jobs) from labor supply distortions (e.g., frictions that discourage women’s labor force participation) and can be computed using data on labor income and job types. Our methodology also highlights an important distinction between welfare-relevant misallocation and the consequences on aggregate GDP if misallocation arises between market work and non-market activities. To showcase the versatility of our index, we analyze gender misallocation within countries over time, across countries over the development spectrum, and across local labor markets within countries. We find that misallocation is substantial and that demand distortions account for most of the productivity losses.</content>

    <title>What Do (Thousands of) Unions Do? Union-Specific Pay Premia and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of union heterogeneity in shaping wages and inequality among unionized workers. Using linked employer-employee data from Brazil and job moves across multi-firm unions, we estimate over 4,800 union-specific pay premia. Unions explain 3–4% of earnings variation. While unions raise wages on average, the standard deviation in union effects is large (6–7%). Validating our approach, wages fall in markets with higher vs. lower union premia following a nationwide right-to-work law. Linking premia to detailed data on union attributes, we find that unions with strike activity, collective bargaining agreements, internal competition, and skilled leaders secure higher wages. High-premium unions compress wage gaps by education while the average union exacerbates them. Post right-to-work, however, worker support for high-premium unions falls when between-group bargaining differentials are large. Our findings show that unions are not a monolith—their structure and actions shape their wage effects and, consequently, worker support.</content>

    <title>The Breakdown of the English Society of Orders: The Role of the Industrial Revolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of the English Industrial Revolution in promoting social mobility and ending the society of orders: one based on rigid social categories and regulated by inherited characteristics. We combine two new datasets on individual wealth holdings before and after the Industrial Revolution. Our main finding is that noble and gentry titles as well as surnames explain significantly less of the variation in wealth after the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, these declines are substantially larger in the parts of England most impacted by the Revolution. We also explore the extent to which different characteristics predict being rich. We then study a key facet of this increased social mobility - geographical and occupational mobility. We show that people with surnames that were more mobile tended to be in the north and working in manufacturing. Moreover, areas that experienced greater outward mobility were more urbanized; less agrarian; had institutionalized markets; more gentry; were poorer (as proxied by tax revenues); and were more likely to be the residence of a member of parliament.</content>

    <title>Partial Language Acquisition: The Impact of Conformity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes patterns of majority language acquisition in an economy consisting of a majority group and multiple minority groups. We consider contexts in which allows individuals choose among three options: full learning, partial learning, or no learning of the majority language. The key innovation in our approach is the introduction of a conformity factor in language acquisition, where peer pressure and community status may outweigh communicative and economic incentives for some individuals. Notably, we identify a non-monotonic relationship between the level of conformity and the distribution of full learners, partial learners, and non-learners in equilibrium. This finding is significant for policy considerations, as small adjustments in language acquisition costs may unpredictably influence language acquisition patterns across minority groups.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how couples in the Medicare Part D program choose an insurance plan. Over 70 percent of enrollees choose the same plan as their spouse. Even among those with differing healthcare needs, well over half do so. Discrete-choice models suggest beneficiaries value being on the same plan as their spouse at over a thousand dollars per year. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we show that younger spouses disproportionately follow their older spouse’s plan choice. Joint plan choice contributes modestly to overall overspending, but increases costs substantially for the couples with different cost-minimizing plans.</content>

    <title>Unbalanced Financial Globalization</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model of international investment and production to investigate the real implications of the last five decades of financial globalization. We introduce a wedge accounting framework to estimate country- and time-varying measures of outward and inward Revealed Capital Account Openness (RKO). We show how to identify these wedges for a large panel of countries using limited publicly available data on national accounts and external asset and liability positions since the 1970s. Our analysis reveals striking cross-country differences in the pace and direction of financial account opening: wealthier countries have become relatively more open to foreign capital inflows, while poorer countries have become relatively more open to capital outflows, a phenomenon we call “Unbalanced Financial Globalization.” Counterfactual simulations show that this unbalanced financial globalization has worsened capital allocation, resulting in a 5.9% decrease in world GDP, a 3.4% rise in cross-country income inequality, lower wages in poorer countries, and a decline in rates of return on capital in richer countries. In contrast, if financial account opening had been uniform, the improved allocation of capital would have reduced income inequality, and increased global GDP. These findings underscore the crucial role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping the real impact of international capital markets integration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information frictions significantly shape students' academic trajectories, but their differential impact across student backgrounds remains understudied. Using a novel panel survey capturing incoming students' subjective expectations and anonymized transcript data from Arizona State University, we first show that parental education strongly predicts educational success, even after controlling for demographics and measurable college preparation. First-generation students enter college less informed and with more uncertain beliefs, facing substantial challenges stemming from limited understanding and uncertainty about the higher education setting. A Bayesian expected utility maximization model demonstrates that higher uncertainty alone can sustain persistent achievement gaps. Empirically, students update their beliefs and make academic decisions consistent with the model’s predictions. Finally, leveraging a natural experiment involving a targeted first-year experience program for academically marginal students, we demonstrate that cost-effective interventions can successfully reduce knowledge frictions, improve retention, and encourage beneficial early major switching.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Deposit Flightiness and its Impact on Financial Stability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that deposit flightiness varies significantly over time, peaking after Covid-19. Elevated deposit flightiness coincides with QE and low interest rates.   We rationalize these trends based on heterogeneity in investors’ convenience value. Investors in the banking system value the convenience benefits of deposits more than outside investors. Following deposit inflows, e.g., due to QE's reserve expansions, the marginal depositor in the banking system becomes less convenience seeking and the risk of panic runs increases.   As a result,  policy rate hikes  are more destabilizing when preceded by QE. Our findings reveal a novel linkage between conventional and unconventional monetary policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new dataset built from a global non-profit startup program for early-stage high-technology startups called Creative Destruction Lab (CDL). The early stages of startup formation remain one of the least understood aspects of firm growth. The nature of this program and the data collected from its operations are well suited to investigate open questions in entrepreneurial strategy, entrepreneurial finance, advice, and technology transfer. This dataset combines three critical features for rigorous empirical research. First, the large, multi-year sample includes roughly 15,000 applicants, 9,000 founders in admitted startups, and nearly 2,000 mentors. Second, CDL recognized the academic value from the outset and built enterprise IT linking venture-level characteristics, structured longitudinal records of firm development and operations, and unstructured verbatim transcripts of mentor–founder discussions. Third, the data cover 27 technological domains such as therapeutics and quantum computing. This paper provides an overview of the setting from which data is collected, a high-level description of available data, and information on how to access these data for research.</content>

    <title>Navigating the College Affordability Crisis: Insights from College Savings Accounts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With higher education costs consistently outpacing inflation and public funding declining, college affordability has become a critical barrier to economic mobility for middle- and low-income families. While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higher-income, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of post-graduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite broad acceptance among economists, carbon taxes face persistent public resistance. We measure the sources and distribution of welfare losses from unexpected European carbon price changes by estimating their impact on consumer prices, labor income, financial wealth, and government transfers. A 1% carbon-policy-induced increase in energy prices yields an average welfare loss of about 1.5% of a year’s consumption, primarily driven by indirect labor-income effects. Younger, poorer, and less educated households, especially in Southern and Eastern Europe, bear a disproportionate burden. These findings suggest public opposition to carbon taxes stems from legitimate distributional concerns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common approach to markets with adverse selection is to regulate competition to minimize inefficiencies, while preserving consumer choice among firms. We study the role of procurement auctions—leading to sole provision by the winning firm—as an alternative market design. Relative to regulated competition, auctions affect product variety, quality, markups, and remove cream-skimming incentives. We develop a framework to study this comparison and apply it to individual health insurance in the US. We find that procurement auctions would increase consumer welfare in most markets, mainly by limiting inefficiencies from adverse selection and market power, and by increasing quality.</content>

    <title>The Extraordinary Rise in the Wealth of Older American Households</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There has been a seismic shift in age-wealth profiles in the U.S. over years 1983 to 2022. The most notable is the sharp rise in the relative household wealth of age group 75 and over. Correspondingly, the relative wealth holdings of all other age groups dropped over these years. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, the paper focuses on the youngest age group, 35 and under, and the oldest age group, 75 and over, and analyzes the factors behind these relative shifts in wealth. I find that the three principal factors are the homeownership rate, total stocks directly and indirectly owned, and home mortgage debt. The homeownership rate is the same in the two years for the youngest group but falls relative to the overall rate, whereas it shoots up for the oldest group both in actual level and relative to the overall average. The value of stock holdings rises for both age groups but vastly more for the oldest households compared to the youngest ones and accounts for a substantial portion of the elderly’s relative wealth gains. Mortgage debt rises in dollar terms for both groups but considerably more in relative terms for the youngest group.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the multifaceted relationship between culture and health from an economic perspective, integrating insights from anthropology, psychology, and political science. It begins by examining how culture provides meaning to illness and suffering and explores how culturally grounded “disease theory systems” influence beliefs about what causes illness, how and whether suffering should be remedied, and the appropriate role of the state in allocating health care resources. The importance of culture in defining the boundary between normal and abnormal pathology is highlighted via case studies. The chapter next reviews evidence on how health behaviors such as smoking, firearm ownership, dietary practices, and reproductive decisions are influenced by cultural norms of masculinity and religiosity. Lastly, it examines how firms, governments, and civil society leverage and advance cultural narratives to influence individual behavior and public policy. Thus, culture in relation to health both naturally evolves and is actively constructed, with implications for health inequality and health policy.</content>

    <title>Decomposing Trends in the Gender Gap for Highly Educated Workers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the gender gap in log earnings among full-time, college-educated workers born between 1931 and 1984. Using data from the National Survey of College Graduates and other sources, we decompose the gender earnings gap across birth cohorts into three components: (i) gender differences in the relative returns to undergraduate and graduate fields, (ii) gender-specific trends in undergraduate field, graduate degree attainment, and graduate field, and (iii) a cohort-specific “residual component” that shifts the gender gap uniformly across all college graduates. We have three main findings. First, when holding the relative returns to fields constant, changes in fields of study contribute 0.128 to the decline in the gender gap. However, this decline is partially offset by cohort trends in the relative returns to specific fields that favored men over women, reducing the contribution of field-of-study changes to the decline to 0.055. Second, gender differences in the relative returns to undergraduate and graduate fields of study contribute to the earnings gap, but they play a limited role in explaining its decline over time. Third, much of the convergence in earnings between the 1931 and 1950 cohorts is due to a declining “residual component.” The residual component remains stable for cohorts born between 1951 and the late 1970s, after which it resumes its decline.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2019, the United States implemented new regulations for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) aimed at increasing transparency and strengthening accountability. These rules introduced stronger performance incentives designed to improve organ procurement outcomes. This paper examines the impact of the reform on organ donations, transplant activity, and associated system costs, with a particular focus on kidneys, given their clinical characteristics and the structure of the reform’s organizational incentives. We estimate that the new policy led to an average increase of 7.13 kidneys procured per OPO per month, relative to a baseline mean of 24.78. The largest effects are observed among top-performing OPOs prior to the reform, with similar patterns for transplanted organs. Consistent with these findings, we document an overall rise in total OPO costs, with statistically significant increases concentrated among low-performing OPOs. Finally, we present a back-of-the-envelope calculation estimating the fiscal impact of the reform.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines intergenerational mobility in China and Russia during their transitions from central planning to market systems.  We consider mobility as movement captured by changes in status between parents and children. We provide estimates of overall mobility, which involves mobility during transition to a system's steady state, as well as steady state mobility, which captures long-run mobility independent of transitional dynamics or shifts in the marginal distribution of outcomes across generations. We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries.</content>

    <title>Is This Really Kneaded? Identifying and Eliminating Potentially Harmful Forms of Workplace Control</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a large German bakery chain, many workers report negative perceptions of monitoring via checklists. We survey workers and managers about the value and time costs to all in-store checklists, leading the firm to randomly remove two of the most perceivedly time-consuming and low-value checklists in half of stores. Sales increase and store manager attrition substantially decreases, and  this occurs without a rise in measurable workplace problems. Before random assignment, regional managers predict whether the treatment would be effective for each store they oversee. Ex post, beneficial effects of checklist removal are fully concentrated in stores where regional managers predict the treatment will be effective, reflecting substantial heterogeneity in returns that is well-understood by these upper managers. Effects of checklist removal do not appear to come from workers having more time for production, but rather coincide with improvements in employee trust and commitment. Following the RCT, the firm implemented firmwide reductions in monitoring, eliminating a checklist regarded as demeaning, but keeping a checklist that helps coordinate production.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As Ukraine emerges from the devastation of war, it faces a historic opportunity to engineer its own Wirtschaftswunder—a productivity-driven economic transformation akin to post-war West Germany. While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine’s long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business dynamism and engineer Ukraine’s Wirtschaftswunder. Policies targeting specific types of firms have limited efficacy when incumbents run wild.</content>

    <title>Reserves, Sanctions and Tariffs in a Time of Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the determinants of individual central bank holdings of international reserves, as shares of gold, dollar, euro, pound, yen and yuan, over the 1999-2022 period.  We augment standard economic determinants of size, exchange rate volatility, currency pegs and bilateral trade with bilateral political/economic variables such as disagreement in UN voting, military alliances, and financial and trade sanctions. These variables augment uncertainty measures such as global Economic Policy Uncertainty, US monetary and trade policy uncertainty, and the VIX. In addition, we investigate whether the US imposition of tariffs in 2018 had any measurable impact on dollar and other holdings. We conclude that financial sanctions and trade policy uncertainty have a statistically and economically significant effect on holdings of the US dollar. US tariffs had an economically – but not statistically – significant impact on shares of foreign exchange reserves: dollar shares fell by 2.1% and other shares rose by 0.8%. These findings can inform the debate regarding some of the benefits and costs of using such geo-economic policies.</content>

    <title>Aggregate Efficiency with Heterogeneous Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study aggregate efficiency when households have heterogeneous preferences and outcomes. We generalize the consumption-equivalent variation of Lucas (1987) to a multi-agent setting, asking: how much can the consumption-possibility set shrink while keeping every agent at least as well off as in their status-quo allocation? The resulting scalar — resources left over after compensating everyone — is our measure of aggregate efficiency. Efficiency rises whenever the same status-quo welfare can be achieved with fewer resources. We show how to convert this problem into an equivalent utility-maximization problem, enabling the use of tools and results normally applicable only in representative agent settings. We characterize changes in aggregate efficiency in terms of observables, like expenditures and price elasticities, and apply our results to study, among other things, the effects of productivity shocks, the costs of misallocation, and the gains from trade, both with and without costly redistribution.</content>

    <title>Selection Bias and Racial Disparities in Police Use of Force</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study racial disparities in police use of force. A pervasive issue in studies of policing is that the available data are selected by the police. As a result, disparities computed in the observed sample may be biased if selection into the data differs by race. We develop a framework and econometric strategy for correcting this bias, using variation across officers in enforcement intensity to identify the racial composition of the unobserved population at risk of selection. Using detailed administrative data on arrests and force incidents from Chicago and Seattle, we find that Black civilians comprise 56 percent of arrestees but about 49 percent of potential arrestees. Correcting for sample selection doubles our measure of the racial disparity in force rates. Decompositions of the corrected force disparity reveal that about 70 percent is unexplained by other demographic and incident characteristics, suggesting an important role for officer discrimination. Our selection bias estimates meaningfully impact the conclusions drawn in the existing literature.</content>

    <title>How Retrainable are AI-Exposed Workers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document the extent to which workers in AI-exposed occupations can successfully retrain for AI-intensive work. We assemble a new workforce development dataset spanning over 1.6 million job training participation spells from all US Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act programs from 2012–2023 linked with occupational measures of AI exposure. Using earnings records observed before and after training, we compare high AI exposure trainees to a matched sample of similar workers who only received job search assistance. We find that the average earnings return to training among AI-exposed workers is high, around $1,470 per quarter. Low-exposure trainees capture higher returns, and trainees who target AI-intensive work face a 29% earnings return penalty relative to their high exposure peers who pursue more general training. We estimate that between 25% to 40% of occupations are “AI retrainable” as measured by its workers receiving higher pay for moving to more AI-intensive occupations—a large magnitude given the relatively low-income sample of displaced workers. Positive earnings returns in all groups are driven by the most recent years when labor markets were tightest, suggesting training programs may have stronger signal value when firms reach deeper into the skill market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether highlighting streaks—instances of repeated and consecutive behavior when completing learning tasks—encourages 4th to 6th grade students in Peru to increase their use of an online math platform and improve learning. 60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders with positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders, or (iv) to a control group. Highlighting streaks and providing personalized reminders significantly increased platform use compared to generic reminders and the control group, with streaks more effective on the intensive margin and personalized reminders more effective on the extensive margin. Highlighting streaks also significantly improved math achievement compared to the control group among the 1,500 students who took an endline test, although differences with other treatment arms were not significant.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the labor market impacts of Brazil’s 1993 outsourcing legalization using North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness, and comparing security guards to less-affected occupations. We find that outsourcing legalization persistently reallocated jobs from older incumbent guards to younger entrants. Total employment of guards and their entry from informality persistently increased, while average demographic-adjusted wages remained constant. Meanwhile, a wave of occupational layoffs displaced some incumbent guards from high-wage firms. The evidence suggests that the rise of non-core activity outsourcing reduced labor market frictions, facilitated by firm-level economies of scale in human resources and spillovers to non-adopting firms.</content>

    <title>General Laws and the Emergence of Durable Political Parties: The Case of Pennsylvania</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In previous work we have highlighted the importance of revisions to state constitutions that mandated that laws be general and uniform throughout the state. Indiana (in 1851) was the first state to adopt a general-law mandate, but most other states followed suit by the end of the century—most of them in the 1870s. This paper focuses on Pennsylvania, one of the states that made the change in the 1870s. We show that the movement to revise the state constitution was led by Republican party bosses seeking to suppress factional strife they thought was threatening their party’s dominance and perhaps even its existence. Their effort succeeded. We argue that it was the shift to general laws in Pennsylvania and other states that led to the emergence of a party system in the United States dominated by two durable political organizations.</content>

    <title>How Much Tax Do US Billionaires Pay? Evidence from Administrative Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate income and taxes for the wealthiest group of US households by matching Forbes 400 data to the individual, business, estate, and gift tax returns of the corresponding group in 2010–2020. In our benchmark estimate, the total effective tax rate—all taxes paid relative to economic income—of the top 0.0002% (approximately the “top 400”) averaged 24% in 2018–2020 compared with 30% for the full population and 45% for top labor income earners. This lower total effective tax rate on the wealthiest is substantially driven by low taxable individual income relative to economic income. First, the C-corporations owned by the wealthiest distributed relatively little in dividends, limiting their individual income tax unless they sell their stocks. Second, top-owned passthrough businesses reported negative taxable income on average in spite of positive book income, further limiting their individual income tax. The top-400 effective tax rate fell from 30% in 2010–2017 to 24% in 2018–2020, explained both by a smaller share of business income being taxed and by that income being subject to lower tax rates. Estate and gift taxes contributed relatively little to their effective tax rate. Top-400 decedents paid 0.8% of their wealth in estate tax when married and 7% when single. Annual charitable contributions equalled 0.6% of wealth and 11% of economic income in 2018–20.</content>

    <title>Hopping on an Earlier Flight: Optimal Waiting with Multiple Flights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When should travellers leave for the airport? This paper develops a model for optimal airport arrival timing when travellers face uncertain travel times and can potentially board earlier flights. We show that access to earlier flights creates a ``recourse option" that fundamentally changes optimal behaviour. While earlier flights always reduce the probability of missing one's scheduled departure, they may paradoxically increase expected waiting time when travellers adjust their arrival strategies. Using renewal theory, we establish that with frequent service, the expected waiting time converges to half the headway between flights—a fundamental limit that cannot be improved through better planning. We connect the problem to newsvendor theory, showing how the fixed penalty for missing flights (rather than linear costs) leads to distinct optimality conditions. Our results explain why rational travellers should occasionally miss flights and provide practical guidelines for airlines designing standby policies and for travellers making departure decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare care for Black versus white patients following pulse oximetry, a widely-used device for measuring blood oxygen levels which over-estimates oxygen saturation in darker-skinned patients. Black patients are therefore medically more appropriate for follow-up care than white patients with the same pulse oximetry reading. Yet, using data from the Veterans Health Administration on 3.5 million emergency department visits between 2014 and 2018, we find that Black patients systematically receive lower rates of follow-up care than white patients with the same reading. Our findings illustrate how bias in a medical screening device is propagated and amplified in downstream care.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the evolving relationship between religion and economic development in emerging and developing countries (EDCs). Building on large-scale survey data and recent scholarship,  we document persistent and, in many regions, increasing levels of religiosity. First, we present global trends in religious beliefs and practices, highlighting a religious divergence between EDCs and high-income countries, as well as the continued prevalence of traditional belief systems alongside major world religions. Second, we analyze the determinants and consequences of religious behavior, showing how income volatility, financial insecurity, and cultural transitions sustain demand for religion. Third, we explore the institutional and political dimensions of religion in EDCs, emphasizing the role of religious institutions as public goods providers and as politically influential actors. This discussion offers a framework for understanding religious organizations as adaptive, competing platforms in pluralistic religious marketplaces. Overall, our findings suggest that religious adaptation, rather than decline, is central to understanding the future of religion and its economic implications in the developing world.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on normative household financial choices almost always gives quantitative guidance in one of two forms: a simple formula for an unrealistic setting, or numerical solutions for only a few parameter sets in a realistic setting. We propose a middle-ground approach we call practical finance: analytic approximations to optimal solutions as a function of relevant parameters in realistic settings that are easily computed in a spreadsheet. We provide such an approximation for lifecycle portfolio choice with labor income. Across 5,103 parameter sets, our approximation results in welfare that is on average only 0.06% lower than that of the optimal solution.</content>

    <title>Robinson Meets Roy: Monopsony Power and Comparative Advantage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a number of insights into the nature and consequences of monopsony power through the lens of comparative advantage, where employers’ power in wage setting stems from match-specific rents. Chief among them is that employers will apply larger wage markdowns to workers with greater comparative advantage at their firm. This leads to stronger monopsony power over more productive workers, provided the workers’ comparative advantage aligns with their absolute advantage. Using Brazilian administrative data, we confirm this prediction: monopsony disproportionately affects high-wage workers within firms and workers at high-paying firms. The model, calibrated to our estimates for Brazil, predicts that minimum wages increase both wages and formal employment for more productive workers while pushing less productive workers out of formal employment.</content>

    <title>College Application Mistakes and the Design of Information Policies at Scale</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether large-scale information interventions can improve college application outcomes in a centralized admissions system. Using nationwide surveys from Chile, we document widespread information frictions and frequent application mistakes, such as omitting attainable preferred programs or failing to include safety options. To address these frictions, we partnered with the Ministry of Education to implement a large-scale field experiment that provided applicants with personalized information on admission probabilities and program characteristics through customized online platforms. The intervention increased the probability that previously unmatched students received an assignment by 44% and improved placement into higher-ranked programs by 20%. Building on these results, the policy was scaled nationwide, reaching all applicants. The scaled-up version, evaluated via an encouragement design, confirmed substantial gains, including higher admission rates for initially unmatched students and persistent enrollment improvements. Our findings show that low-cost, personalized information policies, when integrated into centralized admissions platforms, can substantially reduce application mistakes and improve student outcomes at scale. The results also highlight how leveraging existing market design infrastructure can enable scalable, cost-effective interventions that enhance efficiency and equity in higher education access.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inequality of opportunity has great normative importance. This has led to a literature on measuring the part of overall inequality that is due to circumstances outside of a person’s control. We contribute to such studies by evaluating the implications of uncertainty about circumstance variables and linear versus nonlinear transmission of circumstances on inequality of opportunity estimates. Applying linear Bayesian model averaging methods and three ensemble tree-based machine learning approaches to data from 31 European Union countries, we find that ignoring model uncertainty can lead to substantial overstatement of levels of inequality of opportunity.</content>

    <title>Corporate Hierarchy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel measure of corporate hierarchies for over 2,500 U.S. public firms. This measure is obtained from online resumes of 16 million employees and a network estimation technique that allows us to identify hierarchical layers. Equipped with this measure, we document several facts about corporate hierarchies. Firms have on average ten hierarchical layers and a pyramidal organizational structure. More hierarchical firms have a more educated workforce, higher internal promotion rates, and longer employee tenure. Their operating performance is higher, but they face higher administrative costs. They are more active acquirers and produce more patents, but not higher-quality patents. They exhibit lower stock return volatility and more stable cash flows. We also examine how companies adjust their hierarchies in response to demand and knowledge shocks. We find that biotech companies increased their number of layers following the Covid-19 pandemic, while companies flattened their hierarchies following the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. These findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of existing models of corporate hierarchies.</content>

    <title>Misinformation and Mistrust: The Equilibrium Effects of Fake Reviews on Amazon.com</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fake product reviews—and the manipulation of reputation systems by sellers more broadly—are a widespread issue for two-sided platforms. We study two primary channels through which such manipulation can affect market outcomes: (i) creating misinformation about the reviewed product, and (ii) breeding mistrust in ratings system overall. To examine these in the Amazon.com marketplace, we measure misinformation by observing products purchasing fake reviews and measure mistrust by eliciting shoppers’ beliefs about the prevalence of fake reviews on Amazon through an incentivized survey experiment. We incorporate these into a structural model of demand in which consumers form beliefs about product quality based on observed reviews and perceptions about their trustworthiness. Counterfactual policy simulations indicate that fake reviews reduce consumer welfare, shift sales from honest to dishonest sellers, and ultimately harm the platform. Welfare losses arise primarily from misinformation that leads to worse purchases. While mistrust also leads to purchasing mistakes, the consumer harms of mistrust are largely offset by increased price competition under a weakened ratings system. Finally, we identify key limitations in platforms’ incentives to police manipulation and evaluate enforcement alternatives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and test a theory of firm size and scope centered on standardization: the extent to which a firm’s products are similar. Heterogeneous firms choose the number, quality and standardization of their products. Standardizing makes expanding scope less costly, which then increases the return to standardization. Standardized firms have endogenously higher marginal returns to scale—their marginal costs rise less sharply with scale—implying greater responsiveness to demand shifts. We construct a novel measure of standardization using detailed product characteristics and show support for the theory’s main predictions. We show that new product features from standardized firms diffuse more quickly.</content>

    <title>Expecting Harm? The Impact of Rural Hospital Acquisitions on Maternal Health Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While numerous papers document the effects of mergers on cost and quality, the effects of hospital mergers on access to care are less certain. Merging hospitals may limit access by closing one of the affected hospitals or eliminating individual service lines. However, hospital systems may have more resources to improve care delivery. We study the impact of hospital mergers on obstetric care in rural markets, where there may be heightened concern about the availability of local care options. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we find that when rural hospitals are acquired, there are substantial increases in the probability of obstetric unit closures, with resulting large reductions in the number of births at the hospital. We find mixed effects on health outcomes: there are small increases in maternal morbidity, but no changes in newborn outcomes on average. However, there are improvements of newborns with Medicaid coverage. Additionally, we find decreases in maternal transfers and increases in procedures consistent with women delivering in more resourced hospitals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider founders of limited liability firms who previously held jobs in the formal sector of Brazil. Managers are five percent of former job holders but their startups account for 27 percent of new firm employment. Relatively little of their overrepresentation as founders or the larger size of their startups is explained by their previous wages or other standard human capital variables. Among non-managerial former occupations we examined those clearly connected to demand (sales) and to supply (technology, purchasing). Only purchasing was comparable to managerial occupations in entrepreneurship and new firm size. Further examination suggests that a key to greater entrepreneurship and larger initial firm size is that workers’ former jobs entailed building relationships with other businesses: in demand-side occupations, they sold to other businesses; in supply-side occupations, they bought from other businesses.</content>

    <title>Composition Beats Collapse: Insights from the Bisin–Verdier Model on Endogenous Fertility Reversal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fertility rates have fallen below replacement in most countries, fueling predictions of demographic collapse and even human extinction. These forecasts overlook a crucial fact: societies are not homogeneous. Using the Bisin–Verdier model of cultural transmission with endogenous fertility and direct socialization, calibrated to U.S. and global religion data, we identify an evolutionary counterforce. Subpopulations with persistently high fertility survive, expand their share, and push the total fertility rate (TFR) upward over time. Even if every country’s TFR reaches a below-replacement level, the persistence of above-replacement groups makes extinction unlikely. Our simulations point to a future of growth with pronounced compositional change—driven above all by high-fertility religious communities—rather than collapse. In particular, in our baseline ten-generation world calibration, Muslims become the largest tradition by share.</content>

    <title>The Risk Protection Value of Moral Hazard</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health insurance lowers the out-of-pocket price of healthcare, and it is well-established that this leads to higher utilization of care. This type of "moral hazard" is typically viewed as a social cost of insurance. Within a standard  model, we show that there are two important ways in which the consumer's ability to change her behavior in response to insurance can play a central role in the ability of insurance to protect her from risk. These are (i) by allowing optimal exploitation of real income gained in bad states, and (ii) by enabling more resources to be shifted to bad states than otherwise could be. We provide a theoretical characterization of these cases and quantify their importance empirically. Under standard parameterizations of demand for healthcare and health insurance, estimates in the literature imply that moral hazard accounts for as much as half of the total value of risk protection derived from insurance. Preventing consumers from changing their behavior in response to insurance would lower costs, but also result in a major loss of risk protection, on-net reducing consumer welfare in the population we study. Our results suggest that under-utilization of healthcare may thus be an equally important threat to welfare as over-utilization.</content>

    <title>onetary Economics at 30: A Reexamination of the Relevance of Money in Cashless Limiting Monetary Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The well-known cashless-limiting result in Woodford (1998) has become the theoretical foundation for a large body of work that treats the costs and benefits of holding money as irrelevant for monetary transmission. I reexamine this result and find that it relies on a peculiar credit-market structure consisting of perfectly competitive, zero-interest deferred payment arrangements. I show that the result breaks down when the microstructure is generalized to allow for an endogenous interest rate and market power in credit intermediation. The tenuousness of this influential result should give pause to the widespread practice of basing monetary policy advice on models without money.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate the passthrough of Treasury supply to bank deposits through bank market power. We show that a larger Treasury supply crowds out deposits with disproportionate effects in more competitive deposit markets. A larger Treasury supply further curtails bank lending and affects bank funding structure. The explanatory power of Treasury supply is not driven by other shocks to deposit demand and supply. In comparison, monetary policy rate hikes have a larger impact on deposit funding in more concentrated markets, consistent with the deposits channel of monetary policy. Our empirical findings are rationalized in a model of imperfect deposit competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit the theory of critical deterrence—the idea that military spending may reduce the risk of conflict by increasing its expected costs. To test this theory, we assemble a new cross-national dataset combining information on armed conflicts and defense spending over a 75-year period. We find that increases in military spending have no effect on short-run conflict risk—contrary to concerns that buildups may provoke escalation—but that they do lead to a small and persistent decline in conflict over the long run. Although the effect of spending on conflict is modest, its effect on the cost of war is large: higher military spending raises the scale of battlefield casualties. The effect of military spending on conflict is more pronounced for democracies, which are less likely to use force offensively, and is concentrated in internal conflicts involving nonstate actors. The deterrent power of military spending is strongest in ethnically polarized societies—precisely where the threat of civil war is most acute. Last, using dyadic data, we find that higher military spending causes a decrease in bilateral interstate conflict, and that this effect may be larger than the one we document for intrastate conflict using panel data. Taken together, our results point to a low pass-through from the cost of war to its incidence: even sharp increases in military spending yield only modest gains in deterrence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using novel scenario-based survey questions that randomize the expected duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Middle East conflict, we examine the causal impact of geopolitical risk on consumers’ beliefs about aggregate economic conditions and their own financial outlook. Expecting a longer conflict leads European households to anticipate a worsening of the aggregate economy, with higher inflation, lower economic growth, and lower stock prices. They also perceive negative fiscal implications, anticipating higher government debt and higher taxes. Ultimately, households view the geopolitical conflict as making them worse off financially and it leads them to reduce their consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new facts about the largest American companies over the past century. In manufacturing, top firms in the 1910s, 1950s, and 2010s predominantly date back to around 1900. Even as this special generation persists, turnover among top firms has been substantial. In contrast, in retail and wholesale, we do not observe a special generation among top firms. We show in a model of firm dynamics that a special generation can arise from an industrial revolution, through the adoption of a scalable technology and learning-by-doing. Top firm turnover is matched by standard idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Time-varying market size growth rates or entry costs are not sufficient to explain the facts. Among retailers and wholesalers, learning appears absent, so a special generation would be harder to sustain. Our results highlight the potential for lasting nonstationarity among the dynamics of top firms, which can result from the long echoes of technological change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the simplest OLG models with capital accumulation, demonstrating three results that stand in marked contrast to those of the standard model: first, the possibility of multiple steady states; second, the possibility of multiple momentary equilibria under rational expectations; third, one of implications of multiple momentary equilibria is that dynamics may be marked by complex fluctuations (lacking even periodicity), but still within well-defined bounds. We provide quite general conditions (with general utility and production functions) under which in the simplest of OLG models, there can be multiple steady states, multiple momentary equilibria, and complex dynamics. Furthermore, we present a simple illustration of wobbly growth by incorporating credit friction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm price-cost markups may reflect (a) bigger step sizes from quality innovations that confer significant knowledge spillovers onto other firms, and/or (b) higher process efficiency than competing firms or other factors which bear no obvious knowledge externality. We write down an endogenous growth model with innovation step size and process efficiency as alternative sources of markup heterogeneity. Compared with the laissez-faire equilibrium, the social planner wants to reallocate research towards high step size firms but not high process efficiency firms. We then use price and productivity data across firms in French manufacturing to infer firm step sizes and process efficiency. We find that the planner could achieve faster growth by reallocating research toward high step size firms, and more so if high step size firms could freely license their innovations to high process efficiency firms.</content>

    <title>Navigating Medicaid: Experimental Evidence on Administrative Burden and Coverage Loss</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Millions of people lose access to safety-net programs each year because they do not complete the required administrative processes. In a large-scale field experiment, we randomized outreach offering personalized assistance during the Medicaid renewal window to identify the impact of transaction costs on coverage loss. Our intervention – which provided information and assistance – simplified the renewal process without affecting eligibility, ensuring that avoidable coverage loss among eligible beneficiaries accounts for any effects we find. Sending pre-recorded calls offering free one-on-one assistance from health insurance navigators increased Medicaid renewal by 1 percentage point, a 1.5% increase relative to the control arm. However, the phone number on file was likely no longer valid for at least one-fifth of beneficiaries, suggesting some people did not receive their calls. Receiving the call increased successful renewals the most for tribal members (by 8 percentage points or 13%) and children (by 3 percentage points or 4%); receiving the call also increased renewals for people with income below the sample median (by 2 percentage points or 4%) and people with chronic disease (by 3 percentage points or 4%). Together, these data suggest that some eligible people, including those who need care, lose Medicaid because they struggle with the required administrative processes. The findings do not support the typical rationale for allowing barriers or costs to enrollment—namely, that they efficiently discourage participation by those who do not need or value the benefits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign trade has significantly contributed to global improvements in living standards, a reduction in global inequality since the mid-1990s, and the lifting of millions out of extreme poverty. These gains were supported by the rules-based international order established after World War II. However, these achievements are now under threat. Escalating trade wars risk not only causing significant economic harm to both the United States and low-income countries, but also exacerbating geopolitical tensions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper leverages a large minimum wage reform in Uruguay to study the effects of minimum wages on the distribution of firm wage premia. Wage inequality decreased substantially after the reform, with almost all of the decrease attributed to a reduction in between-firm inequality. AKM variance decompositions show that the relative variance of firm fixed effects substantially decreased after the reform. A time-varying AKM model reveals that this pattern was driven by a compression in the distribution of firm fixed effects, with low-paying firms increasing their fixed effect after the minimum wage increase. Both firm-level and worker-level difference-in-differences analyses show that the minimum wage reform had a causal effect on the compression in the distribution of firm wage premia. The results suggest that minimum wages can increase the supply of "good jobs" by "making bad jobs better", in addition to reallocating workers towards "good jobs".</content>

    <title>Endogenous Firm Ownership in General Equilibrium</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines firm ownership structures in competitive general equilibrium by introducing a model where ownership rights emerge endogenously rather than being assumed. By embedding the property rights theory of the firm into general equilibrium analysis, the model demonstrates how market forces determine both initial firm formation by entrepreneurs and subsequent trading of ownership rights. The key finding is that, in equilibrium, firms are created by managers who have long-term importance to performance, but these founder-managers then sell ownership to outside investors. This pattern emerges because managers can capture value through both the sale price and their ongoing employment relationship, while outside owners can only benefit through ownership. The model thus provides a novel theoretical foundation for observed patterns of entrepreneurial exit and reconciles competing approaches to firm ownership in general equilibrium theory. Additionally, it identifies a distinct economic definition of an entrepreneur as an agent whose human capital is valuable for firms even when they do not remain long-term owners. The framework generates insights into firm formation, ownership dynamics, and the nature of entrepreneurship while maintaining the core structure of competitive general equilibrium analysis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how collective bargaining affects both wages and amenities. By merging collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) to linked employer-employee data in Brazil, I combine rich contracted amenities with wage information. I implement a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits a court ruling enforcing CBA continuation (i.e., ultractivity) to estimate the effects of union bargaining power. Strengthening unions raises wages and amenities without reducing employment—increasing retention despite some labor-labor substitution. A revealed preference approach shows that amenities account for 45% of total compensation gains. These findings suggest that collective bargaining can offset monopsony power, but employers retain the right-to-manage workforce composition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The use of telemedicine has been on the rise. Although telemedicine has increased access to health care, little is known about how the medium changes providers’ medical decision-making. To evaluate how telemedicine differs from in-person care, we compare the quality and cost of in-person clinic visits and virtual visits over the phone for common conditions in Rwanda. To control for patient selection, we conduct an audit study with 2,532 standardized patient visits, where individuals portraying real patients presented standardized cases for malaria and upper respiratory infection (URI). We find that the quality of virtual care is higher than that of in-person care for URI and equally as good for malaria. Telemedicine providers also asked more questions about symptoms and medical history and prescribed more optional medicines for symptom management than in-person providers. We further find that telemedicine is more efficient than in-person care: virtual consultations were faster, had shorter wait times, resulted in fewer unnecessary medications and tests, and cost less for patients. Controlling for a rich set of provider characteristics, we show that provider selection does not appear to drive the results. Instead, better provider-patient communication over the phone emerges as a key mechanism. Providers report that it is easier to treat, get information from, and relate to patients over the phone. Providers also report feeling less social pressure during phone consultations. Consistent with survey evidence, we find that providers prescribe unnecessary antibiotics when asked by patients face-to-face, but not over the phone.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine disparities in acquittal rates and sentencing for Black and White soldiers in the US Civil War using all general courts-martial. We find that Blacks were disproportionately punished for group actions like mutiny and for violent crimes involving group violence, suggesting fears of large-scale rebellion influenced justice. However, we also uncover a system that was fair relative to many modern criminal courts in acquittals and in death sentences. The needs of the Army pushed towards fairness.</content>

    <title>Productivity and Wedges: Economic Convergence and the Real Exchange Rate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and the real exchange rate, specifically focusing on the convergence in price levels in Eastern European countries. While these countries have had significant convergence in GDP per capita (relative to the EU average) since the 1990s, convergence in real exchange rates for these countries stalled after the EU crisis. Using a standard theoretical framework, we estimate the main drivers of real exchange rates and show that a combination of productivity growth (Balassa-Samuelson effects) and labor market distortions help explain real exchange rate trends. We develop a structural two-country model that provides a rich decomposition of the long run determinants of the real exchange rate. Simulations based on observed sectoral productivities and labor market wedges show that the model can accurately account for the historical path of Eastern European real exchange rates, both before and after the EU crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program aims to reduce youth substance use by fostering multi-sector collaboration and implementing locally tailored strategies within the community. This study is among the first to evaluate the program’s impact on youth development outcomes in the United States. Using the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) difference-in-differences (CSDID) estimator, we find that the DFC program significantly reduces drug-related juvenile crime and improves academic performance. The effects are particularly pronounced in communities where coalitions include government agencies, highlighting the critical role of institutional coordination in mobilizing local resources. We also explore behavioral mechanisms, documenting reductions in marijuana use and opioid-related inpatient hospitalizations. A cost-benefit analysis indicates substantial welfare gains, suggesting that early-life prevention represents a cost-effective investment in public health.</content>

    <title>Openness and Growth: A Comparison of the Experiences of China and Mexico</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the late 1980s, Mexico opened itself to international trade and foreign investment, followed in the early 1990s by China. China and Mexico are still the two countries characterized as middle-income by the World Bank with the highest levels of merchandise exports. Although their measures of openness have been comparable, these two countries have had sharply different economic performances: China has achieved spectacular growth, whereas Mexico’s growth has been disappointingly modest. In this article, we extend the analysis of Kehoe and Ruhl (2010) to account for the differences in these experiences. We show that China opened its economy while it was still achieving rapid growth from shifting employment out of agriculture and into manufacturing while Mexico opened long after its comparable phase of structural transformation. China is only now catching up with Mexico in terms of GDP per working-age person, and it still lags behind in terms of the fraction of its population engaged in agriculture. Furthermore, we argue that China has been able to move up a ladder of quality and technological sophistication in the composition of its exports and production, while Mexico seems to be stuck exporting a fixed set of products to its North American neighbors.</content>

    <title>Labor and Product Market Power, Endogenous Quality, and the Consolidation of the US Hospital Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing structural analyses of the harmful effects of market consolidation focus on either product or labor markets in isolation, ignoring that product market competitors often compete for workers as well. This paper develops a unified framework for merger evaluation, finding that firms' simultaneous exercise of oligopoly power in the product market and oligopsony power in the labor market amplifies the harm from mergers to both consumers and workers. The model also demonstrates how merger-induced gains in labor market power incentivize firms to reduce product quality, highlighting an additional channel for consumer harm. The model's predictions are tested and quantified in the context of the recent consolidation of the US hospital industry. Linking panel data from several sources on all US hospitals from 1996-2022, a difference-in-differences design is estimated for nearly 150 high-concentration within-market mergers. Hospital mergers significantly reduce patient volume, increase prices, reduce employment, lower wages, and deteriorate quality of care, resulting in higher patient mortality. After recovering the structural parameters, the estimated model replicates observed merger impacts. Counterfactual exercises reveal that ignoring increased labor (product) concentration would lead one to under-predict the harm of mergers to consumers (workers).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how parental income and family structure during childhood and adolescence affect adult income, emphasizing the timing of these effects. Using an ordered multinomial probability model with functional covariates, we find that these familial influences are strongest in middle childhood and adolescence. We also uncover a complementary relationship in the effects of income and family structure trajectories during key developmental periods. By flexibly controlling for personal and family characteristics using nonparametric methods, our approach effectively handles high-dimensional covariates. The results advance the understanding of intergenerational income mobility and highlight the long-term importance of familial conditions for adult economic success.</content>

    <title>Serial Acquisitions in Tech</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine serial acquisitions in the technology sector from 2010 to 2023. Defining serial acquisitions based on a granular S&amp;P industry taxonomy, we find that they account for 24–37% of majority-control tech M&amp;A, with over half completed by public firms. Followon targets in a series are generally larger and older than the initial acquisition, and among public acquirers, starting a series is associated with higher market value and greater innovation value, but not with significant changes in market competitiveness. Among deals with valid transaction values, over half of serial deals exceed the reporting threshold of the U.S. Hart–Scott–Rodino (HSR) Act. However, in below-threshold acquisitions, acquirers primarily target their core business category. Accounting for the cumulative value of a series would, in most cases, keep the timing of HSR review unchanged or modestly accelerate it, but when it does accelerate it, review could occur several deals or years earlier, potentially yielding important benefits in markets with long acquisition sequences. Finally, while Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM) stand out from the rest of the sample for more frequent serial acquisitions, some other large acquirers display similar patterns.</content>

    <title>Cumulative Risks of Foster Care Placement for U.S. Children: Comparing Birth Cohort and Synthetic Cohort Approaches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foster care placement is a far-reaching intervention that can have substantial long-term effects on children and families. Lifetime prevalence estimates are based on synthetic cohort life tables, which rely on a stationarity assumption that age-specific rates are stable over time. This paper uses a birth cohort life table approach for the 2000-2002 cohorts, where data from birth to 18 years allows us to observe lifetime prevalence of foster care placement directly. We find that 5.0% of children born in these cohorts were placed in foster care, including 10% of Black children and 12% of Native American children, with considerable heterogeneity across U.S. states. By comparing both methods, we see that synthetic cohort estimates were 17% higher than birth cohort estimates because placement rates for teenagers were higher at the point of synthetic cohort estimation than during their actual teenage years. We extend synthetic cohort estimates to 2019 and find similar placement rates by sex over time, increasing shares of placements due to neglect and substance abuse, decreasing shares due to child behavioral issues, and an increasing share of placements into kinship foster care. These patterns are similar regardless of the approach.</content>
