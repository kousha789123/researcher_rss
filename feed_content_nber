    <title>Broadband Internet Access and Adolescent Mental Health in the U.S.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Broadband internet has become a critical component of U.S. infrastructure, but policymakers are increasingly concerned that the widespread adoption of this technology has adversely affected adolescent mental health. To test this hypothesis, we use 2009–2019 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Survey data and leverage the nationwide rollout of broadband internet. First, we show that adolescents in states with greater broadband internet access reported spending more time online. Next, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in broadband internet access was associated with a 9.3–16.5-percent increase in adolescent suicide ideation. While we document increases in suicide ideation for both girls and boys, the results are most pronounced for adolescent girls. Exploring potential mechanisms, we show that greater broadband internet access was associated with increases in cyberbullying and body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls and a reduction in the likelihood that adolescent boys reported getting an adequate amount of sleep.</content>

    <title>Global Ripple Effects of Corporate Tax Reforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.</content>

    <title>The Ins &amp; Outs of Chinese Monetary Policy Transmission</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel indicator for the People's Bank of China monetary policy stance, we estimate a policy rule that accounts for the dual nature of its price stability mandate—encompassing domestic inflation and the exchange rate—and for the evolution of its operational framework.  The “Ins”: The domestic transmission follows textbook patterns, with exceptions due to the active management of the renminbi and the financial account. The "Outs": International spillovers are powerful and affect commodity markets, global production and trade. The pass-through to foreign (US) prices is substantial. Financial spillovers are second-order, and mostly derivative from trade spillovers.</content>

    <title>Payment-Chain Crises</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Saki Bigio, Esteban Méndez &amp; Diana Van Patten</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces an endogenous network of payment chains into a business cycle model. Motivated by evidence of linked payments across firms in Costa Rica, we develop a framework where production orders form bilateral relations: some payments are executed immediately, while others---chained payments---are delayed until upstream payments are received. These chains capture real-world situations in which firms must wait to be paid before paying their own suppliers, leaving resources temporarily idle even when demand and capacity exist. In equilibrium, agents choose the amount of chained payments given interest rates and access to internal funds or credit lines. This choice determines the payment-chain network and aggregate total-factor productivity (TFP). The paper characterizes equilibrium dynamics and pecuniary externalities when agents internalize their own payment delays but not the delays imposed on others.</content>

    <title>Employment Impacts of the CHIPS Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The CHIPS and Science Act, enacted in August 2022, is a key element of the revival of U.S. industrial policy. We examine the short-term employment effects of the act. Drawing on quarterly industry-by-county data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), we implement two county-level difference-in-difference designs, the first comparing counties with pre-existing semiconductor facilities to other counties with high-tech industries and the second comparing counties with semiconductor fabrication facilities (which were targeted for the bulk of the CHIPS funding) to counties with non-fabrication semiconductor facilities. Using both approaches, we find robust, positive employment impacts in affected counties. The effects began at the time of the passage in the Senate of a precursor bill, in anticipation of the signing of the CHIPS Act. Our preferred estimates suggest an increase of 110 jobs per affected county in the first design and 180 jobs per affected county in the second design. We also find robust positive impacts on local construction employment. Evidence on total employment and GDP at the county level, as well as on employment in upstream input sectors, is mixed. Simple back-of-the-envelope calculations (which come with caveats) suggest national direct employment effects of approximately 15,000-16,000 jobs in the core semiconductor sector and indirect effects of 28,000-35,000 jobs in related sectors.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Regulating Greenwashing: Evidence from Europe’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on mutual fund flows and investment sustainability. The SFDR classifies funds into three categories to promote transparency and curb greenwashing: those with a sustainable investment objective (Article 9 or “dark green”), those that promote environmental characteristics (Article 8 or “light green”), and others (Article 6). Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the SFDR had little effect on fund flows or portfolio sustainability. The disclosures were ineffective in part because they offered little new or clear information beyond what investors could already infer from fund names and mandates. In an experimental setting, we show that the current disclosures have minimal impact on investor decisions, but making the information more intuitive could improve the regulation’s effectiveness.</content>

    <title>Principled Identification of Structural Dynamic Models</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Neville Francis, Peter Reinhard Hansen &amp; Chen Tong</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We take a new perspective on identification in structural dynamic models: rather than imposing restrictions, we optimize an objective. This provides new theoretical insights into traditional Cholesky identification. A correlation-maximizing objective yields an Order- and Scale-Invariant Identification Scheme (OASIS) that selects the orthogonal rotation that best aligns structural shocks with their reduced-form innovations. We revisit a large number of SVAR studies and find, across 22 published SVARs, that the correlations between structural and reduced-form shocks are generally high.</content>

    <title>What Drives Corporate Savings</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the determinants of corporate cash holdings by extending the standard q theory of investment with financing frictions and productivity shocks. While existing models predict a low propensity to hold cash, we show that realistic cash holdings arise only when three ingredients are combined: 1.) costly external financing, 2.) persistent productivity shocks, and 3.) contemporaneous productivity shocks. With costly external financing, persistent productivity shocks generate predictable cash flows and investment opportunities, but yield little need for savings since the internally generated cash flows are aligned with the investment needs. Contemporaneous shocks make internally generated cash flows random, inducing firms to hold cash at levels consistent with those observed empirically.</content>

    <title>The Incidence of Tariffs: Rates and Reality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2025, statutory tariff rates on U.S. imports rose to levels not seen in over one hundred years. What are the implications for prices? On the one hand, shipping lags, exemptions, and enforcement gaps have kept the actual implemented rates at only half of the statutory rates, moderating the tariffs’ impact. On the other hand, tariff pass-through to U.S. import prices is almost 100 percent, so the United States is bearing a large share of the costs. We study the incidence of the 2018-2019 and 2025 U.S. tariffs and discuss implications for U.S. sourcing, domestic manufacturing costs, and the dollar.</content>

    <title>Extreme Temperatures Promote High-Fat Diets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extreme temperatures threaten agriculture and exacerbate global food insecurity, yet their direct impact on dietary choices remains poorly understood. We provide novel evidence of how short-term exposures to extreme temperatures affect macronutrient intake in China. We show that both hot and cold weather elevate high-fat diet risks. In particular, hot weather reduces carbohydrate and protein consumption but not fat intake, while cold weather increases all nutrient intake, particularly fats. Temperature-induced dietary changes are shaped primarily by physiological responses to thermal stress, whereas physical activities demonstrate little effect. Technologies that improve indoor thermal comfort (via fans, air conditioners, and heating systems) substantially mitigate high-fat diet risks. Socioeconomic disparities are evident, with rural and poor individuals more likely to adopt high-fat diets under hot or cold weather. Projections indicate that more extreme temperatures due to climate change may increase the prevalence of high-fat diets nationally, while substantial regional heterogeneity emerges, with declines in northeast China and increases in southern China. These results highlight a crucial but overlooked pathway linking climate change to dietary health inequality.</content>

    <title>Quality Upgrading in Global Supply Chains: Evidence from Colombian Coffee</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do the returns to quality upgrading pass through supply chains to primary producers? We explore this question in the context of Colombia’s coffee sector, in which market outcomes depend on interactions between farmers, exporters (which operate mills), and international buyers, and contracts are for the most part not legally enforceable. We formalize the hypothesis that quality upgrading is subject to a key hold-up problem: producing high-quality beans requires long-term investments by farmers, but there is no guarantee that an exporter will pay a quality premium when the beans arrive at its mills. An international buyer with sufficient demand for high-quality coffee can solve this problem by imposing a vertical restraint on the exporter, requiring the exporter to pay a quality premium to farmers. Combining internal records from two exporters, comprehensive administrative data, and the staggered rollout of a buyer-driven quality-upgrading program, we find empirical support for the key theoretical predictions, both the lack of pass-through of quality premia under normal circumstances and the possibility of a buyer-driven solution through a vertical restraint. Calibration of the model suggests that one-third to two-thirds of the (substantial) gains from the program accrue to farmers, with the vertical restraint playing a critical role. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that quality upgrading can provide a path to higher incomes for farmers, but also that it is unlikely to be viable under standard market conditions in the sector.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effects of the first metro rail line in Mumbai using administrative data on assessed property prices from 2011-18 for 723 subzones in the city. Comparing areas within 1 km of the metro with those beyond 1 km but within 3 km, we estimate the effects on property values for commercial, industrial, and residential properties. We find a significant and persistent increase in prices of 6-8% for residential and commercial land use categories in treated areas relative to control areas after Metro Line 1 opens. We show that commute time savings and improvements in employment accessibility are plausible mechanisms underlying these effects.</content>

    <title>One Instrument, Many Treatments: Instrumental Variables Identification of Multiple Causal Effects</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many instrumental variables applications specify a single Bernoulli treatment. But instruments may change outcomes through multiple pathways or by varying treatment intensity. Lottery instruments that boost charter school enrollment, for instance, may affect outcomes by lengthening time enrolled in a charter school and by moving students between charter schools of different types. We analyze the identification problem such scenarios present in a framework that generalizes the always-taker/never-taker/complier partition of treatment response types to cover a wide range of multinomial and ordered treatments with heterogenous potential outcomes. This framework yields novel estimators in which a single randomly assigned instrument identifies (i) causal effects averaged over complier types and (ii) a causal conditional expectation function that captures effects for each element in a set of response types. Three empirical applications demonstrate the utility of these results. The first extends an earlier analysis of the Head Start Impact Study allowing for multiple fallbacks. The second examines two causal channels for the impact of post-secondary financial aid on degree completion. The third estimates effects of additional births (an ordered treatment) on mothers’ earnings.</content>

    <title>Fiscal Inaction as Monetary Support</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the fiscal framework affect the central bank's ability to stabilize output and inflation? The textbook answer, which assumes Ricardian households, recommends that fiscal adjustment should be fast enough to allow for monetary dominance. We instead argue that, with non-Ricardian households, the central bank may indeed welcome slow, or even no, fiscal adjustment. On the demand side, slow fiscal adjustment helps stabilize aggregate spending; on the supply side, it eases tax distortions, improving the output-inflation trade off. And while the first channel favors slow fiscal adjustment only when the business cycle is dominated by demand shocks, the second channel extends this preference to supply shocks. A quantitative exercise affirms our lessons in the U.S. context, with the central bank preferring virtually no fiscal adjustment over the business cycle.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how digital incentives influence survey participation and engagement in a large randomized controlled trial of parents across seven Texas school districts. We test how incentive amount and information about vendor options affect response behavior and explore differences by language background. Incentivized parents were more likely to start and complete surveys and claim gift cards, though Spanish-speaking parents exhibited distinct patterns—greater completion rates but lower redemption rates, often selecting essential-goods vendors. Increasing incentive value and providing advance information both improved engagement. Findings inform the design of equitable, effective digital incentive strategies for diverse populations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial behavior plays a role in many economic contexts, and it has been explained by altruism, social pressure, signaling, and expectations of fairness and reciprocity. We examine prosocial behavior in a context that allows us to distinguish the role of self-signaling and social signaling from alternative explanations, including warm glow. Our context is residential solar, and  self-signaling is separately identified from social signaling by the exogenous visibility of potential solar arrays. We show that the political affiliation of proximate peers influences the extent of self-signaling and is crowded out by the private benefits of installing solar.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test for and measure green waste: the misallocation of public subsidies for green investment projects. Our context is a major Norwegian program for green investment subsidies. We develop a model of subsidy allocation and apply it to detailed project-level data on carbon emissions and subsidy amounts for both marginal and inframarginal projects. We find that decision-makers could have achieved the same level of emission reductions at less than half the cost. To isolate the sources of this green waste, we use data on both ex-ante expected and ex-post realized emission reductions for each project. We find that decision-makers are able ex-ante to identify the projects with the highest ex-post emission reductions but unwilling to select them.</content>

    <title>Bayesian Inference in IV Regressions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well known that standard frequentist inference breaks down in IV regressions with weak instruments. Bayesian inference with diffuse priors suffers from the same problem. We show that the issue arises because flat priors on the first-stage coefficients overstate instrument strength. In contrast, inference improves drastically when an uninformative prior is specified directly on the concentration parameter—the key nuisance parameter capturing instrument relevance. The resulting Bayesian credible intervals are asymptotically equivalent to the frequentist confidence intervals based on conditioning approaches, and remain robust to weak instruments.</content>

    <title>The Morality of Market Exchanges: Between Societal Values and Tradeoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Certain behaviors in markets are unambiguously unethical. In other cases, however, voluntary exchanges that can create gains from trade remain contested on moral grounds, because of what is traded or of the price at which the exchange occurs. This chapter offers a framework to analyze these contested markets and provides examples of two general instances. First, we examine “repugnant” transactions involving the human body—such as compensated organ donation and gestational surrogacy—where concerns about dignity, exploitation, and inequality conflict with welfare gains from expanding supply. Second, we study price gouging in emergencies, where demands for a “just price” clash with the incentive and allocation roles of price adjustments under scarcity. Across both cases, we synthesize evidence on societal attitudes and highlight how support for policy options depends on perceived trade-offs between autonomy, fairness and efficiency, and on institutional features that can separate compensation from allocation.</content>

    <title>Entry and Exit in Treasury Auctions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hedge funds have become increasingly active in Treasury markets, yet we have little  evidence on how this shift has affected the market. We focus on the primary market, where the government issues its debt through auctions. Using over 20 years of  data from Canadian Treasury auctions, we document dealers exiting and hedge funds entering. To evaluate the costs and benefits of this trend for debt issuance, we develop an auction framework with endogenous participation. We find that the expected gains from greater hedge fund participation, driven by increased competition, are smaller than the costs that arise because hedge funds—unlike dealers—do not participate regularly. Currently, dealer participation remains sufficiently strong that policies aimed at stabilizing  participation have little effect on funding costs.</content>

    <title>Ruling for the Rich: the Supreme Court over Time</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To investigate the emergence of a pro-wealthy bias in the US Supreme Court, we develop a protocol to identify and analyze all cases involving economic issues from 1953 to the present. We categorize the parties in these cases as “rich” or “poor” according to their likelihood of being wealthy. A vote is pro-rich if that outcome would directly shift resources to the party that is more likely to be wealthy. Using this dataset, we estimate case-specific intercepts, justice-specific latent ideal points, and party-level time trends using the Bayesian methods pioneered by Martin and Quinn (2002). In the 1950s, justices appointed by the two parties appear similar in their propensity to cast pro-rich votes. Over the sample period, we estimate a steady increase in polarization, culminating in an implied party gap of 47 percentage points by 2022. The magnitude of the gap suggests the usefulness of an economic metric for prediction relative to ideologies such as originalism or textualism.</content>

    <title>From Treatment to Safety: The Role of Substance Use Treatment in Preventing Intimate Partner Violence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substance use is a well-established driver of intimate partner violence (IPV), with drug-related incidents posing persistent challenges for both public health and criminal justice systems. We examine how expanding access to substance use treatment (SUT) services affects IPV in the United States by leveraging variation in the opening and closing of treatment facilities at the county level. Using administrative data on IPV incidents from the National Incident-Based Reporting System at the agency level from 1998 to 2019 combined with county-level records on treatment facility information, we implement a continuous difference-in-differences research design. Our results show that adding three SUT facilities—the average annual increase per county over the sample period—reduces drug-involved IPV by about 1.5–1.7 percent. We find no evidence of significant effects on alcohol-related or non-substance-related IPV. Staggered event-study analyses confirm parallel outcome trends, across treated and non-treated counties, prior to net facility openings and lend support to a causal interpretation of the estimates. Related evidence from SUT admissions drawn from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) shows that new centers significantly raise treatment entry, particularly among men, consistent with reduced perpetration driving the observed decline in IPV exposure. Our findings highlight the role of health services infrastructure in shaping violence-related outcomes and underscore the broader public safety benefits of investment in treatment access.</content>

    <title>Valuing Sticky Deposits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a formal fixed-income framework to value sticky deposits. This framework provides closed-form expressions for deposit values and allows us to study the impact of stickiness on deposit interest-rate and runoff risks. The duration of a bank deposit can be either positive or negative, which has important implications for hedging the interest-rate risk of bank balance sheets. Banks that maximize deposit value by following optimal deposit beta strategies may significantly increase their interest-rate and deposit runoff risks. We test the empirical implications of the valuation model using market deposit premia observed in bank merger/acquisition transactions. The results provide strong empirical support for the model’s predictions.</content>

    <title>Tariff War Shock and the Convenience Yield of US Treasuries — A Hedging Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explain how the “Tariff War” shock of April 2025 affected the safe-asset status of US Treasuries. Convenience yield erosion for long bonds is consistent with a reduction in the hedging property, reflected in a rising stock-bond covariance. Decomposing the Treasury yield into risk-free rate, credit spread, and convenience yield components reveals that covariance due to the convenience yield component increased for long bonds. The short end of the Treasury curve, however, continued to exhibit the safe-asset hedging property. These effects are consistent with a withdrawal of safe-asset investors from long-term Treasuries and a rotation towards shorter-term Treasuries and gold.</content>

    <title>O-Ring Automation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study automation when tasks are quality complements rather than separable. Production requires numerous tasks whose qualities multiply as in an O-ring technology. A worker allocates a fixed endowment of time across the tasks performed; machines can replace tasks with given quality, and time is allocated across the remaining manual tasks. This “focus” mechanism generates three results. First, task-by-task substitution logic is incomplete because automating one task changes the return to automating others. Second, automation decisions are discrete and can require bundled adoption even when automation quality improves smoothly. Third, labour income can rise under partial automation because automation scales the value of remaining bottleneck tasks. These results imply that widely-used exposure indices, which aggregate task-level automation risk using linear formulas, will overstate displacement when tasks are complements. The relevant object is not average task exposure but the structure of bottlenecks and how automation reshapes worker time around them.</content>

    <title>Biases in Belief Updating Within and Across Domains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do people sometimes overreact to new information and other times underreact? We develop a model in which the strength of a signal—how much one should update their beliefs with new information—depends on multiple features of the information environment. Limited attention to these features leads to misperceptions of signal strength: people approach a problem with an experience-based prior, which they adjust only partially based on how much attention they pay to different features. This mechanism explains a wide range of belief-updating patterns. Insensitivity to a single feature generates underreaction to strong and overreaction to weak signals, and more neglected features amplify this. Insensitivity to multiple features can instead break that pattern: insensitivity to one feature can generate excess sensitivity with respect to another, leading to overreaction to both weak and strong signals. A series of experiments provides support for the model and its underlying mechanism.</content>

    <title>Making Entrepreneurs: Long Term Returns to Training Youth in Business Skills</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the medium and long term impacts of Skills for Effective Entrepreneurship Development (SEED), a 3-week entrepreneurship training program for secondary school students in Uganda. The mini-MBA, modeled after business school curricula, was implemented as a randomized field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 4,402 youth. After four years, the training improved both hard and soft skills. SEED graduates became more effective negotiators and communicators and exhibited improved self-efficacy, stability, plasticity, and stress management. In the medium run, treated youth were more likely to start enterprises and more successful in ensuring their survival, thereby gaining greater entrepreneurial experience. Their ventures were also of higher quality: more likely to be formal, have employees, be in collaboration with other entrepreneurs, and use effective business management practices. With 52% of the sample still enrolled in post-secondary education, we find suggestive evidence that businesses led by the treatment groups performed better. After nine years, business ownership converged between treatment and control groups as control ownership rates doubled. However, SEED graduates maintained their edge in terms of business quality and operated firms with 20% higher revenues and 16% higher profits, without corresponding increases in capital or labor inputs, consistent with higher total factor productivity. Entrepreneurial success was achieved through the adoption of better business practices and experimentation, with soft skills related to entrepreneurial mindset playing a complementary role. SEED generated high returns on investment: the present discounted values of SEED-induced business and total earnings equal 20 and 27 times program costs, respectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study dynamic visual representations as a proxy for investor sentiment about the stock market. Our sentiment index, GIFsentiment, is constructed from millions of posts in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) on a leading investment social media platform. GIFsentiment correlates with seasonal mood variations and the severity of COVID lockdowns. It is positively associated with contemporaneous market returns and negatively predicts returns for up to four weeks, even after controlling for other sentiment and attention measures. These effects are stronger among portfolios that are more susceptible to mispricing. GIFsentiment positively predicts trading volume, market volatility, and flows toward equity funds and away from debt funds. Our evidence suggests that GIFsentiment is a proxy for misperceptions that are later corrected.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how traders' equity capitalization influences asset prices in a framework that accounts for market power. In our model, traders with capital constraints engage in transactions in an imperfectly competitive market. We demonstrate that looser capital constraints elevate both asset prices and price impact, the latter diminishing market liquidity. Using Canadian Treasury auction data, we illustrate how to apply our model to quantify these effects. We estimate the shadow costs of capital constraints by leveraging a temporary policy exemption during 2020-2021. We show that while these constraints are only infrequently binding, their relative impact when activated can be sizable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use population-wide administrative data from Denmark and an event-study design spanning nearly two decades to examine the impact of having a parent with dementia on adult children’s labor market, physical health, and mental health outcomes. We find no meaningful effects on labor supply, earnings, or physical health care use. In contrast, mental health care use increases substantially, driven by daughters, beginning five years before a parent’s dementia-related death, peaking around the time of death, and converging to the counterfactual trend over seven years. Results suggest that robust long-term care policy can largely insulate adult children economically from parental dementia, but mental health spillovers persist, spurring nearly a decade of elevated use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In instrumental variables (IV) estimation with many instruments, such as judge fixed effects designs, the precision of the jackknife-estimated first stage can vary widely across observations.  When such variability exists, we show that the precision of JIVE second-stage estimates is meaningfully improved by shrinking judge propensities towards their conditional means, where the shrinkage factor depends on the precision of the first-stage fitted value.  Doing so requires no further assumptions and identifies the same local average treatment effect as the usual (unshrunken) JIVE estimator. We illustrate the precision gains from using a Shrunken JIVE estimator (SJIVE) in an application from the literature studying pre-trial detention of defendants in criminal cases.</content>

    <title>Unwilling to Reskill? Experimental Evidence from Real-World Jobseekers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study barriers preventing jobseekers from pursuing reskilling in high-demand occupations. Using a discrete choice experiment, we quantify the demand for reskilling among Italian jobseekers in two white-collar high-demand occupations—information technology assistant and construction technician—and identify its main determinants. Willingness to pay estimates show that participants are willing to pay to reskill into IT, but would require compensation to reskill into construction. Beliefs about monetary returns and social status help explain differences in reskilling demand, but perceived identity fit in the target occupation emerges as the most important individual-level factor shaping reskilling decisions. A light-touch randomized information intervention providing data on occupational returns significantly increases both stated interest in reskilling and actual engagement in real-world training.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The global expansion of renewable energy is key to addressing climate change. After a decade of dramatic cost reductions—especially for solar photovoltaics and wind—renewables now approach cost parity with fossil generation. While this cost reduction has led to a steep increase in solar and wind power in several countries, the global share of solar and wind generation remains modest—approximately 15% as of 2023. This article reviews recent economic studies and identifies three central challenges and corresponding opportunities for scaling up renewable energy—underdeveloped regulatory and market design, insufficient intertemporal market integration, and inadequate spatial market integration. The insights from this review highlight effective ways to accelerate the global transition to renewable energy.</content>

    <title>How Monetary Policy Is Made: Lessons from Historical FOMC Discussions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a new dataset of FOMC meeting transcripts from 1966 to 1990 to analyze the sources of heterogeneity in individual monetary policy preferences and study how this heterogeneity shapes policy decisions. Using these detailed discussions, we manually quantify and characterize each FOMC participants’ preferred policies along with their reasoning and justification. We show that participants' beliefs about the effects of monetary policy—specifically, their perceived slope of the Phillips Curve—play a central role. Participants who believe monetary policy has stronger effects on real activity are more likely to cite output as a justification for easing, while those perceiving stronger price effects emphasize inflation as a reason for tightening. We then show that the Chair plays a unique and powerful role in reconciling these views, not just in setting policy rates, but also in minimizing dissent. The latter occurs because dissenters find their ability to influence policy in subsequent meetings is significantly curtailed.</content>

    <title>The Labor Market Return to Permanent Residency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many temporary foreign worker programs issue “closed” visas that effectively tie workers to a single employer, restricting worker mobility and weakening bargaining power. We study the labor market return to temporary foreign workers (TFWs) gaining permanent residency (PR), which loosens this mobility restriction. Using administrative data linking matched employer-employee data in Canada to temporary and permanent visa records from 2004–2014 along with an event-study design, we find that gaining PR leads to a sharp, immediate, and persistent increase in the job switching rate of 21.7 percentage points and an increase in earnings of 5.7 percent three years after PR. Workers also sort into high-wage firms after gaining PR, and the increase in the firm pay premium is roughly 56 percent of the total earnings gain. We find larger earnings gains for job switchers across industries, low-skilled workers, and workers from low-income countries. To guide and interpret our reduced-form results, we develop a search-and-matching model featuring heterogeneous workers and firms. Permanent residents and native-born workers search for jobs in the same labor market and engage in on-the-job search, while TFWs search separately within a segmented labor market and do not receive outside wage offers. We calibrate the model to match our reduced-form results, and we use it to simulate the long-run effects of PR and consider two counterfactual policies: (1) increasing the cost to firms of posting a TFW vacancy and (2) allowing TFWs to switch employers freely under “open” visas. We evaluate how these policies affect output, wages, profits, and overall social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct an international panel data set comprising three distinct yet plausible measures of government indebtedness: the debt-to-GDP, the interest-to-GDP, and the debt-to-equity ratios. Our analysis reveals that these measures yield differing conclusions about recent trends in government indebtedness. While the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached historically high levels, the other two indicators show either no clear trend or a declining pattern over recent decades. We argue for the development of stronger theoretical foundations for the measures employed in the literature, suggesting that, without such grounding, assertions about debt (un)sustainability may be premature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified theory of delegated capital management by extending the paradigm of Berk and Green (2004)  from mutual funds to alternative assets. With competitive markets and rational investors, we derive the optimal contract and account for observed regularities --- performance fees, persistent alpha, and limits on capital. The key distinction between mutual funds and alternatives is the liquidity of the underlying assets. When assets are illiquid, it is optimal to acquire information about the manager's skill. A positive alpha is therefore necessary to compensate informed investors and a performance based contract is required to induce these investors to allocate their capital optimally. At the same time, a free-rider problem emerges that requires capital constraints on uninformed investors. Thus, liquidity of the underlying assets explains the contrasting contract structures across sectors.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Scaling Early Childhood Programs: Lessons from The Chicago School</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many ideas show remarkable returns in small-scale trials but often disappoint when scaled to broader populations and contexts. Using early childhood investment as a case study, this study develops a dynamic human capital formation model that integrates complementary skill investment with “Option C thinking” on scaling challenges. The model is stylized in the Chicago tradition: micro-founded with optimizing agents, dynamic skill production, and a policymaker evaluating scaling decisions. It formalizes how naive extrapolation from pilot studies systematically overestimates policy efficacy by ignoring “voltage drops,” declining treatment effects due to unrepresentativeness at scale. The model demonstrates that optimal scaling policy requires mechanism-based design that anticipates these failures through backward induction from implementation realities. The scientific insights from a set of recent studies provide valuable perspectives on the model.</content>

    <title>How In-School Supervised Ed-Tech Support Produces Massive Learning Gains: A Khan Academy Field Experiment in India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Computer-assisted learning (CAL) platforms frequently underperform at scale not because the technology is ineffective, but because schools face substantial implementation frictions: teachers and administrators must overcome initial technical hurdles, reorganize instructional routines, manage competing scheduling pressures, and do so while uncertain about the technology’s effectiveness—conditions that often lead to low and unproductive student engagement. This study explores whether strengthening implementation structure can raise both the quantity and quality of CAL usage in 83 residential government middle schools in Uttar Pradesh, India and, in turn, learning gains. All schools had access to Khan Academy, but randomly selected treatment schools received on-the-ground lab-in-charges whose sole responsibility was to ensure high-fidelity implementation by securing reliable connectivity, simplifying student rostering, protecting weekly practice time, supervising in-class use, coordinating content with teachers, and monitoring progress. The intervention increased platform usage from 7.2 to 47.4 minutes per week. Mathematics achievement rose by almost half a standard deviation over 31 weeks, with gains broad-based across achievement levels and question difficulty. These results show that the central constraint on effective and scalable CAL is not technology or content, but the presence of organizational structures that ensure sustained, productive instructional use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature has documented widespread variation in health care spending per capita across areas of the United States without correspondingly better health outcomes. Recent work has used mover designs to estimate the causal impact of place on both health care spending and mortality. In this paper, we investigate whether places that increase health care spending also tend to be places that increase health. We find that they do not and discuss the implications.</content>

    <title>Platform Work: Evidence from Drivers in India, Indonesia, and Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using surveys and administrative data from representative samples of drivers working on three leading gig platforms in India, Indonesia, and Kenya, we document the composition, economic experiences, and labor market trajectories of platform workers. Combining platform-based earnings with operating cost data, we estimate earnings net of costs (in PPP-adjusted terms) in each context. We find that the flexible nature of platform work enables drivers to work substantially more than the full-time equivalent, generating higher monthly net earnings than low-skill or casual employment, despite comparable or lower hourly net earnings relative to these outside options. Drivers who exit platform work in India and Indonesia do so to take up better-paying full-time positions. In contrast, Kenyan drivers often exit involuntarily, returning to offline driving with adverse financial consequences. One-third of drivers across countries rely on platform work to supplement earnings during emergencies or slow work periods, suggesting that platform work may play an important role as a financial safety net.</content>

    <title>Transformed Intermediation: Credit Risk to NBFIs, Liquidity Risk to Banks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that the rapid asset growth of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) relative to banks is the outcome of transformations of risks between banks and NBFIs that increase the interconnectedness of the two sectors. These transformations are consistent with avoiding tighter, post-GFC bank regulation while harnessing the funding and liquidity advantages of bank deposit franchises and access to safety nets. Specifically, we show that banks fund NBFIs through senior loans and credit lines, which NBFIs use for acquiring junior credit claims, warehouse financing, and liquidity management. We empirically demonstrate that shocks experienced by NBFIs spillover to the banks that provide them with credit lines, particularly in times of stress. We then describe a number of policy approaches that are consistent with our transformation view and conclude with suggestions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do banks help or hamper green transition? To answer this question, we analyze the dynamics of bank lending to firms in the US, EU, and separately Denmark in relation to the borrowers' emissions of CO2. We evaluate the allocation of bank loans across industries and within industries across firms, allowing for heterogeneity of firm emissions and changes in these emissions. To facilitate green transition, bank lending needs to flow to greener and greening firms, but not out of high-emission industries that need funding to transition to cleaner production methods. Using syndicated loan data, we find that for US borrowers, bank lending was likely hampering green transition, while in the EU bank lending is more likely to facilitate it. Zooming in on Denmark, for which we have data on the full universe of firms and banks, we find more significant credit reallocation to greener firms, especially within industries. However, the reallocation of funds to green firms is, to a large extent, a byproduct of green firms becoming bigger. We do not find any evidence consistent with banks active stewardship of green transition.</content>

    <title>Do GLP-1 Medications Pay for Themselves?</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) represent a major improvement in treatment of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk reduction, but they are also among the most expensive drugs in widespread use and the subject of significant policy debate. The high price of these drugs may overstate their net cost if the health improvements they produce lead to reduced downstream health care use and medical spending, that is, cost offsets. We estimate such offsets using insurance claims data, examining the effects of GLP-1 initiation on subsequent GLP-1 use and spending, and on other non-GLP-1 spending. We use a stacked difference-in-differences design, comparing patients initiating GLP-1 medication to not-yet-treated controls who initiate GLP-1s several months or years later, allowing us to control for underlying time trends and baseline characteristics. Overall, we do not find a reduction in downstream medical spending. Although GLP-1 initiation reduces spending on other diabetes medications, total non-GLP-1 spending increases, driven by higher outpatient health care use; GLP- 1 drug spending rises mechanically. For health care payers, the relevant cost of GLP-1 initiation therefore extends beyond the sticker price of the drug. We find similar results across subgroups of GLP1 initiators including those with prior cardiovascular disease and those without diabetes (consistent with obesity indication). Our main results examine spending responses over the first year after initiation. However, we also estimate longer run effects in a smaller sample and find no cost offsets even five years after GLP-1 initiation. Taken together, these results suggest that payers facing the costs of GLP-1 coverage are unlikely to see large savings from reduced spending on other care. If GLP-1 therapies ultimately yield cost savings, they are likely to occur only over longer horizons or through non-medical channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that preschools facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of conditions that can hinder learning. Low-income children born shortly before their state's school-entry cutoff date are 16.9, 9.3, and 14.8 percent more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a speech or language disorder, and a hearing or vision condition at ages three and four, compared to children born after the cutoff. They are also more likely to receive downstream services. Findings emphasize the role of earlier and longer exposure to public preschool in driving diagnostic gaps previously attributed to elementary school-entry and within-grade peer comparisons.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do investors care about why a firm behaves responsibly, over and above what the firm does and how much cash it earns? In our main experiment, participants value shares in companies that reduce pollution relative to peers, while CEOs articulate the company’s intentions: prosocial or for-profit. Investors are willing to pay more for shares in a company that takes a given prosocial action if it is motivated by social concern rather than profit maximization. This "intention premium" is distinct from the valuation effects of cash flows and environmental externalities. Respondents who are deontological, politically liberal, female, or less individualistic value the company’s intent the most. Additionally, and somewhat surprisingly, respondents view favorably firms that embrace both profit and social objectives, without ranking them. Overall, our findings temper claims that when there is no financial trade-off between doing good and doing well, shareholder value and stakeholder value maximization are equivalent.</content>

    <title>Experiences, Expectations, and Asset Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In models with subjective beliefs, the dynamics of investor beliefs are central to explaining asset price movements. Allowing subjective beliefs to deviate from full-information rational expectations requires a model of how investors form beliefs. I review recent research that explores experience-based belief formation. The experience-based model closely resembles Bayesian updating but allows individuals to overweight data observed during their own lifetimes when forming beliefs about the parameters of the data-generating process. Because individuals of different age learn from different histories, the model predicts heterogeneity between age groups that evolves over time with the path of realized data individuals have experienced, closely mirroring the age-related variation observed in survey microdata. At the aggregate level, experience-based expectations formation can explain asset price dynamics. In the stock market, learning from experience about long-run cash flow growth generates valuation cycles and return predictability. Experience-based formation of long-term inflation expectations can explain secular changes of real interest rates. I conclude by outlining directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Weighing the Impacts of GLP-1s: Quasi-Experimental Evidence From Provider Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The arrival of GLP-1 medications has been described as one of the most important health care innovations in recent years. We provide large-scale quasi-experimental evidence on their real-world impacts by exploiting variation in the eventual prescribing propensities of patients’ pre-existing primary care providers. Using a panel intent-to-treat design, we compare outcomes for 1.4 million diabetic or obese veterans based on their 2018 provider’s eventual propensity to adopt GLP-1s, leveraging comprehensive electronic health records and biomarker data from the Veterans Health Administration, a setting with minimal insurance attrition and low-cost access to these drugs. Patients whose providers become higher propensity adopters experience substantial improvements in glycemic control and clinically meaningful weight loss; our treatment-on-the-treated estimates closely match estimates from clinical trials. Despite these metabolic benefits, we find no statistically significant effects on emergency department utilization, mental health and substance use outcomes, or non–GLP-1 medical spending through 2024.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new evidence on how firms set prices using direct questions from a large, economy-wide survey of UK firms. Since 2023, 54% of firms report setting prices in a state-dependent manner, as opposed to changing prices at fixed intervals. In contrast, 44% of firms used state-dependent pricing in 2019. Smaller firms, those with a higher share of non-labour costs, and those reporting higher subjective uncertainty around sales and prices are more likely to be state-dependent. We then analyse the implications of price-setting behaviour for inflation dynamics. State-dependent firms experienced a sharper increase in price growth over 2022-2023, and also a faster subsequent decline. Using evidence from a randomised survey experiment, firm-level forecast errors, and local projections, we show that prices of state-dependent firms respond faster to cost shocks. The difference between state-dependent and time-dependent firms is furthermore larger for bigger shocks, consistent with theoretical predictions.</content>

    <title>Brexit and UK Migration: Germany-Benchmarked Evidence on Structural and Reallocation Shifts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how Brexit reshaped the volume and composition of UK migration flows. To address the inherent endogeneity of migration responses to political change, the study employs a Difference-in-Differences design that benchmarks the United Kingdom against Germany, a stable EU member unaffected by Brexit-related institutional shocks. Treating the 2016 referendum and the 2021 end of free movement as sequential shocks, the results show that migration volume increased after both shocks, but through different channels: the referendum reduced emigration relative to Germany, while the post-2021 points-based system triggered a reallocation of inflows away from EU free-movement migrants toward non-EU migrants from the rest of the world, with a markedly stronger skill-selective profile. The paper analyzes how Brexit reshaped migration flows into and out of the United Kingdom by exploiting the 2016 referendum and the 2021 termination of free movement as sequential institutional shocks. Using a Difference-in-Differences design with Germany as a stable EU benchmark, the results show that Brexit acted as a structural regime shock, not a border-tightening event. Net migration into the UK rose after both shocks—first due to a sharp post-referendum decline in emigration relative to Germany, and later due to a substantial expansion of non-EU immigration under the new points-based system. Immigration patterns exhibit a clear regime shift, with EU inflows contracting sharply after 2016 and globally sourced, skill-selective inflows rising after 2021. In the later period, a modest but notable increase in UK-born emigration relative to Germany also emerges, reflecting frictions in post-Brexit mobility. Overall, Brexit reoriented—rather than reduced—UK migration flows, transforming both their scale and composition.</content>

    <title>Global Stratification Economics (GSE): A Primer - Definitions and Research Implications</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We coin the term Global Stratification Economics (GSE) to extend Stratification Economics (SE) to international contexts where mechanisms emerge that can be identified as (1) universal but matched to positioning along a country’s development path or (2) context-specific and historically dependent in ways different from the United States and other international environments. Building on SE’s core insight that groups compete over scarce resources and that dominant groups shape rules to preserve advantage, we define GSE as an approach that foregrounds historical genesis (e.g., settler colonialism, slavery, caste, extractive governance, military intervention), local institutions that structure dominance and resistance, and transnational mechanisms (e.g., imported stratification and the lateral mobility hypothesis) that link origin- and destination-country hierarchies. Drawing on evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the global macroeconomy, we synthesize research on intergenerational mobility, wealth and asset inequality, labor-market segmentation, colorism, caste and ethnicity, gendered and intersectional constraints, spatial inequality and property regimes, and global value chains. We conclude by outlining how GSE reshapes measurement and international policy evaluation by centering group-differentiated outcomes, institutional transformation, and pillars of recognition, redistribution, and repair and by offering a checklist for researchers to apply GSE.</content>

    <title>Nuclear Operations with a High Penetration of Renewables: The Case of France</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nuclear and intermittent renewables (wind and solar) are generally regarded as the only scalable technologies producing low-carbon electricity. However, the extent to which these technologies can co-exist in a reliable power system depends on whether nuclear units can adjust their operations to renewable output fluctuations. Using hourly data from the French power system, we find that nuclear units are operated quite flexibly, and that the foregone energy production due to “load following” actions (relative to the counterfactual of operating at full capacity during load following events) is currently limited. However, we find that an additional load following event is associated with a slightly higher likelihood of a unit failure. We also find that unit-level minimum output constraints are binding more frequently as system-wide renewable generation increases, especially so for units most exposed to solar generation. In 2024, hours during which available nuclear flexibility was exhausted are associated with non-positive hourly day-ahead prices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We deployed large language model (LLM) decision support for health workers at two outpatient clinics in Nigeria. For each patient, health workers drafted care plans that were optionally revised after LLM feedback. We compared unassisted and assisted plans using blinded randomized assessments by on-site physicians who evaluated and treated the same patients, as well as results from laboratory tests for common conditions. Academic physicians performed blinded retrospective reviews of a subset of notes. In response to LLM feedback, health workers changed their prescribing for more than half of the patients and reported high satisfaction with the recommendations, and retrospective academic reviewers rated LLM-assisted plans more favorably.  However, on-site physicians observed little to no improvement in diagnostic alignment or treatment decisions. Laboratory testing showed mixed effects of LLM-assistance, which removed negative tests for malaria but added them for urinary tract infection and anemia, with no significant increase in the detection rates for the tested conditions.</content>

    <title>Macroeconomic Impacts of Microeconomic Damages in General Equilibrium: Productivity and Capital Losses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The full economic costs and macroeconomic effects of microeconomic damages associated with pollution damages, climate impacts, and similar negative shocks are not well understood. Beyond the direct damages, market distortions, supply chains, changes in capital and labor costs, etc. can potentially magnify (or diminish) the costs of these shocks. In this paper, we use analytical and numerical general equilibrium models to investigate the channels through which microeconomic shocks affect the macroeconomy. We model different types of shocks, evaluate how anticipation affects the macroeconomic implications of shocks, and measure the overall welfare costs relative to the value of direct damages. We find that preexisting taxes magnify the overall welfare costs relative to direct damages, that savings and investment decisions driven by anticipations of certain types of shocks can interact with tax distortions to lower welfare costs, and that the ratio of welfare cost to direct damages varies substantially across sectors of the economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing evidence suggests that wealth may decline before dementia onset, but the mechanisms underlying these reductions are poorly understood. Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we compare household finance trajectories for individuals who later develop dementia and those who do not. We find that wealth divergence between the two groups is not explained by reduced earnings, higher healthcare spending, intentional “spend-down” to qualify for Medicaid coverage, state-dependent utility, or reverse causation by which wealth declines cause dementia. Instead, our results point to impaired financial decision-making beginning about six years prior to clinically recognizable dementia.</content>

    <title>World Trading System For Whom? Evidence from Global Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use global tariffs to reveal the weights that nations implicitly place on the welfare of their trading partners relative to their own. Our estimated welfare weights suggest that formal and informal rules of the world trading system make countries internalize the impact of their policies onto others to a substantial extent, though not fully. On average, countries place 25% less value on transfers to foreigners than transfers to their own residents. Across nations, we find that countries that put higher welfare weights on the welfare of foreigners also tend to receive higher weights from them, consistent with a general form of reciprocity among nations. Using our estimated welfare weights, we provide a first look at what countries stand to lose, or gain, from the dissolution of the world trading system as we know it.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Older home sellers receive lower returns than younger home sellers. Homes sold by older people have fewer major renovations but higher rates of poor upkeep. Older sellers are also more likely to sell off-MLS (“pocket listings”) and to sell to investors, leading to lower prices. These patterns suggest that older sellers may be disproportionately disadvantaged by agents’ incentive to maximize fees through generating high sales volume instead of maximizing sale prices. Age-related cognitive decline makes the elderly more vulnerable. For causal evidence, we show that reforms making pocket listings more transparent reduced both the prevalence of pocket listings and the magnitude of the age gap in returns.</content>

    <title>Legalizing Cannabis: Implications for Child Maltreatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the United States. Though cannabis possession and consumption are prohibited federally, states are increasingly implementing laws that legalize this substance, initially for medical use and, more recently, for recreational use. We study the impact of recreational cannabis laws (RCLs) that allow all adults 21 years and older to legally consume and possess this substance on reports of child maltreatment and post-investigation service use. To do so, we combine difference-in-differences methods with administrative data on child maltreatment reports 2010-2022. Overall, we find no evidence that child maltreatment reports or service use are influenced by RCL adoption, though we find that physical abuse reports decline. Our findings indicate that recent efforts to legalize cannabis for recreational consumption have not led to an increase in child maltreatment reports.</content>

    <title>Does Advertising Expand the Market for Hospital Services? Evidence from Medicare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Direct-to-consumer advertising is pervasive in US healthcare markets, but little evidence exists on the effects of advertising by hospitals, second only to drug manufacturers in medical marketing. Advertising may help facilities increase market share by stealing existing patients, expand the market for hospital care, or do both. Regardless, it has important public finance implications due to the large sums of taxpayer funds spent by federal and state governments to subsidize hospital operations and finance care through public insurance programs. This paper provides the first causal evidence, to our knowledge, on the market expansion effects of hospital advertising. To obtain causal estimates, we leverage the fact that spikes in political advertising significantly crowd out hospital advertising in the same market, motivating an instrumental variables design. Using claims data on the universe of Traditional Medicare beneficiaries, we find that advertising expands aggregate patient volume and spending on inpatient care – though to a modest degree (implied elasticities of 0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Although the overall effect of advertising on hospital outpatient care is muted, for-profit hospitals obtain higher outpatient Medicare volume and revenue with greater advertising. Across both care settings, therefore, Medicare spending increases with hospital advertising.</content>

    <title>How Globalization Unravels: A Ricardian Model of Endogenous Trade Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how uneven gains from globalization can endogenously generate protectionism as a political equilibrium. Using U.S. data, we document that regions more exposed to import competition display stronger opposition to globalization, especially among households with little financial wealth, and that firms in trade-exposed sectors sharply increase lobbying expenditures. To interpret these patterns, we develop and quantify a general equilibrium Ricardian model with heterogeneous households, input-output linkages, and endogenous trade policy shaped by voting and lobbying. Distributional shocks reallocate political support among voters, while lobbying propagates through production networks, generating strategic complementarities that sustain protectionism. Calibrated to U.S.-China sectoral data from 1991--2019, the model accounts for rising inequality, declining support for globalization, and key aggregate trends in consumption and trade.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Parole Supervision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impacts of a reform to parole supervision in Illinois. The reform reduced the term of supervision for some parolees from 12 months to 6 months while many similar parolees continued to receive 12 months of supervision. We evaluate the impact of the reform using a standard difference-in-differences estimator, and we find clear evidence that the reform reduced prison re-entry rates. Sharp drops in rates of technical revocations drove these reductions. Rates of prison re-admissions linked to new crimes did not change. We merge data from Cook County Courts with our data on state prison admissions and releases, and we find no evidence that the reform increased crime rates among parolees. The reform reduced both the cost of incarceration and the cost of parolee supervision without creating harms to public safety.</content>

    <title>With or Without U? Binning Bias and the Causal Effects of Temperature Extremes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Estimates of climate impacts show that extreme temperatures have large and wide-spread effects. To estimate these effects, a common approach counts days in different temperature ranges and considers how exposure to these distinct 'bins' affects outcomes. This often produces non-linear, U-shaped results, in which high and low temperatures have the largest effects. We show that non-linear approaches like these can generate spurious findings. Specifically, global warming induces trends in extreme temperature exposure that correlate mechanically with a location's baseline temperature. Substantial bias emerges if trends in the outcome variable also correlate with baseline temperature for any reason. We demonstrate this problem theoretically, in simulations, and with real outcomes. We then develop solutions. In applications using US data, some results in the literature are unaffected by these corrections, while other results change substantially.</content>

    <title>Effective Protection with Global Value Chains</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Emily J. Blanchard, Mitchell W. Boice &amp; Robert C. Johnson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effective rate of protection (ERP) is a widely-used tool to evaluate the joint impact of input and output tariffs on the net protection offered to individual sectors. Nonetheless, the theoretical foundations underlying the traditional ERP are decades out of date. In this paper, we provide fresh guidance for policy analysts that seek to measure effective protection, with two core elements. First, we develop a new ERP concept, which measures how much tariffs shift the derived demand for real value added at the sector level. The ERP then has an intuitive interpretation: it is the effective subsidy to buyers of sectoral value added that replicates the impact of the tariff structure on demand. Second, we demonstrate how to compute our ERP index accounting for global value chain linkages. The result is an ERP for the GVC age, in which effective protection depends on the structure of value chains across countries and sectors, and the structure of all tariffs applied globally. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by analyzing how recent tariff changes have altered effective protection in the United States and the rest of the world.</content>

    <title>Price Discrimination with Costless Resale</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that income effects create an endogenous barrier to arbitrage, allowing price discrimination to survive costless resale. A monopolist sells an indivisible good to consumers with heterogeneous incomes who can freely resell. When the good is strictly normal, a consumer's reservation price to resell increases as the purchase price decreases—lower prices leave buyers wealthier and raise their valuation of the good. The monopolist exploits this by subsidising low-income consumers to raise their reservation prices to a target that high-income consumers must also pay. The optimal schedule increases dollar-for-dollar with income in the subsidised segment, weakly dominates uniform pricing, and achieves the first-best allocation when the entire market is served. We show the mechanism extends beyond income effects: low substitutability with market alternatives generates large reservation-price responses even when income sensitivity is modest. Sustaining discrimination requires market power at the individual level—consumer-specific quantity limits—not merely aggregate output restrictions. Extensions examine multiple monopolists and endogenous privacy choices.</content>

    <title>Automation Experiments and Inequality</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many experiments study the productivity effects of automation technologies such as generative algorithms. A key test in these experiments relates to inequality: does the technology increase output more for high- or low-skill workers? However, the theoretical content of this empirical test has been unclear. Here, we formalize a theory that describes the experimental effect of automation technologies on worker-level output and, therefore, inequality. Worker-level output depends on a task-level production function, and workers are heterogeneous in their task-level skills. Workers perform a task themselves or delegate it to the automation technology. The inequality effect of improved automation depends on the interaction of two factors: (i) the correlation in task-level skills across workers, and (ii) workers' skills relative to the technology's effective skill. In many cases we study, the inequality effect is non-monotonic --- as technologies improve, inequality decreases then increases. The model and descriptive statistics of skill correlations generally suggest that the diversity of automation technologies will play an important role in the evolution of inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we explore whether the recent pension reforms enacted in Italy had an impact on the inequality in health among individuals. We construct a set of indexes measuring several health outcomes (both physical and mental) and analyze their evolution along time (across SHARE waves) from 2004 to 2022, by relating them to the households’ income. While we can observe some differences in the health-income gradient between genders, we do not find evidence of a positive relationship between the introduction of the pension reforms and an increase in inequality.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews recent developments in the economics of human development, focusing on the early years of life as a critical period for shaping long-term outcomes. Early childhood development is inherently multidimensional: cognitive and socioemotional skills evolve dynamically and interact with health, nutrition, and environmental influences. Economists have contributed to this field by providing a conceptual unifying framework that highlights how key drivers of development reflect the choices of individuals operating under incentives and constraints. Within this framework, the paper emphasizes two central challenges: understanding the interactions among multiple dimensions of development and identifying causal links - particularly the effects of different inputs at different ages. Measurement issues are a recurring theme, given the difficulty of assessing young children and the need for comparability across contexts. The paper also stresses these issues’ policy relevance for poverty reduction and social mobility by discussing early childhood interventions in both developed and developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure how frontier research frames what is normatively at stake along the efficiency and equity dimension. We develop and validate an LLM-based measurement pipeline and apply it to 27,464 full-text journal articles from 1950 to 2021. Efficiency focused framing rises through the late 1980s, then declines as equity related framing expands after 1990, especially in applied work and policy evaluations. By 2021, papers with an equity component are about as common as papers framed purely around efficiency. President transmittal letters in the Economic Report of the President show a similar post 1990 shift toward equity, providing an external benchmark.</content>

    <title>A Model of Artificial Jagged Intelligence</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI systems often display highly uneven performance across tasks that appear “nearby”: they can be excellent on one prompt and confidently wrong on another with only small changes in wording or context. We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about local reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model “knows” scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering “where the model works” is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Structural economic models, while parsimonious and interpretable, often exhibit poor data fit and limited forecasting performance. Machine learning models, by contrast, offer substantial flexibility but are prone to overfitting and weak out-of-distribution generalization. We propose a theory-guided transfer learning framework that integrates structural restrictions from economic theory into machine learning models. The approach pre-trains a neural network on synthetic data generated by a structural model and then fine-tunes it using empirical data, allowing potentially misspecified economic restrictions to inform and regularize learning on empirical data. Applied to option pricing, our model substantially outperforms both structural and purely data-driven benchmarks, with especially large gains in small samples, under unstable market conditions, and when model misspecification is limited. Beyond performance, the framework provides diagnostics for improving structural models and introduces a new model-comparison metric based on data-model complementarity.</content>

Higher investment by FinTech firms is not accounted for by sectoral focus or differences in firm age. Reasons for higher customer capital investment are explored, including the need to build trust with customers, the focus on downstream segments of the financial marketplace, the operation of platform-based business models, and a heavier reliance on valuable customer data.</content>

    <title>AI in Charge: Large-Scale Experimental Evidence on Electric Vehicle Charging Demand</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the promising opportunities offered by AI to support the decarbonization of electricity grids is to align demand with low-carbon supply. We evaluated the effects of one of the world’s largest AI managed EV charging tariffs (a retail electricity pricing plan) using a large-scale natural field experiment. The tariff dynamically controlled vehicle charging to follow real-time wholesale electricity prices and coordinate and optimize charging for the grid and the consumer through AI. We randomized financial incentives to encourage enrollment onto the tariff. Over more than a year, we found that the tariff led to a 42% reduction in household electricity demand during peak hours, with 100% of this demand shifted to lower-cost and lower-carbon-intensity periods. The tariff generated substantial consumer savings, while demonstrating potential to lower producer costs, energy system costs, and carbon emissions through significant load shifting. Overrides of the AI algorithm were low, suggesting that this tariff was likely more efficient than a real-time-pricing tariff without AI, given our theoretical framework. We found similar plug-in and override behavior in several markets, including the UK, US, Germany, and Spain, implying the potential for comparable demand and welfare effects. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable AI managed charging and its substantial welfare gains for the electricity system and society. We also show that experimental estimates differed meaningfully from those obtained via non-randomized difference-in-differences analysis, due to differences in the samples in the two evaluation strategies, although we can reconcile the estimates with observables.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), the Credit Risk Transfer (CRT) bond market emerged as a new asset class in U.S.  mortgage market. We develop an asset pricing framework for CRTs consistent with Treasury, corporate bond, and housing markets. Our analysis reveals that the Government-Sponsored Enterprises compensate investors approximately fairly on average, though they overpay for low-risk tranches and underpay for high-risk ones. Additionally, the post-GFC guarantee fee increases broadly align with underlying credit risk. We find significant reverse cross-subsidization, where high-credit-risk borrowers subsidize low-risk ones. The 2023 reform partially corrected this cross-subsidization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We collect new data to document the long-run evolution of the firm size distribution in ten market-based economies in Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania, where we can obtain comprehensive coverage of the population of firms. Around the world, we observe prevalent increases in the concentration of sales, net income, and equity capital over the past century. These trends hold in the aggregate and at the industry level. Meanwhile, employment concentration has been stable over the long run in most cases. The evidence shows that the rising dominance of large firms is a pervasive phenomenon, not limited to the recent decades or the United States, and that large firms often achieve greater scale without proportionally more workers.</content>

    <title>Never Enough: Dynamic Status Incentives in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the ability of a firm to elicit repeated effort from workers by creating a “rat race” of hierarchical status-based incentives. We examine performance using data on over 5,000 German air force pilots during World War II. Pilots’ effort is hard to monitor; motivation is key to success. Fighter pilot performance increases markedly as they approach eligibility for a medal before falling off upon receipt of the award. The same effort path repeats itself as the pilot nears the next higher-prestige medal. Status-conscious pilots also exert more effort when new medals are introduced. We show that medals serve as substitutes for other forms of status. Medal cachet declines over time as lower-ability pilots receive them, making the introduction of new medals desirable. These results suggest that a tiered, expanding system of status-based incentives can repeatedly leverage worker status concerns to extract effort.</content>

    <title>Marginal Admission to Elite High Schools: Long-run Effects on Labor Market Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-run effects of marginal admission to elite public high schools on students' labor supply in the context of Mexico City's centralized high school admission system. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we compare students whose placement exam scores are just above and just below the elite admission threshold. We find that five and ten years after the admission exam, marginally admitted students are less likely to be employed in the formal private sector, and, if employed, they earn lower wages. However, these employment and wage gaps close after 15 years. Moreover, we find that marginal admission to elite high schools leads to delayed entry into the formal labor market, and, at least in the short run, students in elite high schools seem to sort into lower-productivity firms and industries.</content>

    <title>How Adaptable Are American Workers to AI-Induced Job Displacement?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct an occupation-level adaptive capacity index that measures a set of worker characteristics relevant for navigating job transitions if displaced, covering 356 occupations that represent 95.9% of the U.S. workforce. We find that AI exposure and adaptive capacity are positively correlated: many occupations highly exposed to AI contain workers with relatively strong means to manage a job transition. Of the 37.1 million workers in the top quartile of AI exposure, 26.5 million are in occupations that also have above-median adaptive capacity, leaving them comparatively well-equipped to handle job transitions if displacement occurs. At the same time, 6.1 million workers (4.2% of the workforce in our sample) work in occupations that are both highly exposed and where workers have low expected adaptive capacity. These workers are concentrated in clerical and administrative roles. Importantly, AI exposure reflects potential changes to work tasks, not inevitable displacement; only some of the changes brought on by AI will result in job loss. By distinguishing between highly exposed workers with relatively strong means to adjust and those with limited adaptive capacity, our analysis shows that exposure measures alone can obscure both areas of resilience to technological change and concentrated pockets of elevated vulnerability if displacement were to occur.</content>

    <title>Tenure-Dependent Severance Costs and Labor Market Dynamics over the Life Cycle</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the labor market effects of tenure-dependent severance pay systems that tie firing costs to workers’ accumulated earnings histories. We develop an overlapping-generations search-and-matching model in which firms face increasing separation costs over the employment relationship. Using administrative employer–employee data from Brazil, we estimate the model and show that tenure-dependent severance costs induce labor hoarding among low-productivity, long-tenured workers who would not be hired if unemployed. These distortions are strongest late in the life cycle, when firms optimally delay separation to avoid severance obligations, while simultaneously imposing higher hiring thresholds on older unemployed workers with shorter continuation values. These forces imply that tenure-based severance policies protect employment histories rather than productivity, shaping labor market dynamics over the life cycle and generating allocative inefficiencies.</content>

    <title>Aggregate Productivity with Discrete Choice</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies aggregate productivity in general equilibrium economies where agents with heterogeneous preferences make discrete choices between locations and occupations. We show how the conventional tools of welfare economics, like cost-benefit analysis, can be extended to these settings. Following Debreu (1951), we measure the change in aggregate productivity as the maximum reduction in total factor productivity such that it is possible to make every household at least indifferent to their status quo allocation. Aggregate productivity rises if primary factors can be saved while keeping every household at least indifferent. We characterize this measure of efficiency in terms of compensated supply and demand curves. We show that, to a first-order approximation, the elasticity of aggregate productivity to productivity shocks is given by sales shares (regardless of preferences and technologies). We also provide second-order approximations in terms of elasticities of uncompensated supply and demand curves. We contrast our approach with some popular alternative measures of aggregate efficiency and welfare: real GDP, the cross-sectional average of utilities, and the sum of compensating variations, and show that these alternative measures have serious flaws.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prediction markets offer a new market-based approach to measuring macroeconomic expectations in real-time. We evaluate the accuracy of prediction market-implied forecasts from Kalshi, the largest federally regulated prediction market overseen by the CFTC. We compare Kalshi with more traditional survey and market-implied forecasts, examine how expectations respond to macroeconomic and financial news, and how policy signals are interpreted by market participants. Our results suggest that Kalshi markets provide a high-frequency, continuously updated, distributionally rich benchmark that is valuable to both researchers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>Research to Improve the Quality, Impact, and Value of Home and Community-Based Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly eight million Americans use Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) to support long-term services and supports for people with disabilities. Recent legislative changes to Medicaid will require states to make difficult choices about how best to meet these long-term services and supports needs. This paper first characterizes the unique goals of HCBS, which differ from those of traditional medical care services, and the state-federal financing and administrative structure of HCBS. Next, based on a review of the literature and input from a panel of experts in HCBS policy and research, we summarize existing evidence and knowledge gaps regarding the quality and cost implications of HCBS at the federal, state, and direct service provision levels. Based on gaps in the evidence, we propose a research agenda related to state-federal incentives, state program choices regarding HCBS financing and delivery models, and the settings and supports for direct service provision. Finally, we describe existing and novel data sources and other opportunities that could accelerate research to fill these evidence gaps and support states and others in designing, implementing, and delivering sustainable, high-quality HCBS.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work requirements are often criticized for imposing administrative burdens that reduce access to benefits, yet prior research has struggled to isolate this mechanism from other sources of disenrollment. This paper provides direct evidence by examining procedural denials in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We study work requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) and exploit age-based exemptions that apply to individuals aged 50 and older. Using administrative data and difference-in-differences models leveraging waiver periods, we find that work requirements significantly increase procedural and overall denials. Our results indicate that these policies deter participation through imposed administrative burdens.</content>

    <title>The Distributional Effects of Cost-Sharing in a Universal Healthcare System</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Patient cost-sharing is used as a tool to limit over-utilization of insured healthcare services in almost all high-income countries. We study its distributional consequences in the context of a publicly-funded universal health insurance system, where consumers (as tax-payers) are residual claimants on insurer spending. We highlight the distinction between consumers' elasticity of demand for healthcare services—which moderates how cost-sharing rules affect healthcare utilization—and their baseline level of demand—which moderates how cost-sharing rules affect out-of-pocket costs. Using detailed administrative data on the Norwegian national health insurance scheme, we study a 2010 policy change that raised the age threshold for cost-sharing exemption, thereby increasing patient cost-sharing substantially for adolescents. We find that females and native-born Norwegians have higher average utilization and thus have more at stake financially from cost-sharing, but are relatively less responsive to cost-sharing. In contrast, lower-income individuals as well as individuals with a chronic health condition have both higher average healthcare utilization as well as higher responsiveness. Cost-sharing therefore places a larger burden on these groups both in terms of the financial cost of out-of-pocket spending and in terms of reduced quantities of healthcare used.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how political parties affect representation in the U.S. House. To do so, I account for party pressure on the votes of members in an otherwise standard spatial model that uses roll call voting patterns to identify member ideologies. I simultaneously estimate voter ideologies from survey responses, leveraging their responses on issues before Congress to bridge voters and members into the same ideological space. I find that, relative to a model without party pressure, member ideologies and those of their constituents are much more closely aligned. The results imply that, in terms of actual votes, parties drive a wedge between members and those they represent. I provide evidence that parties do so strategically, balancing the need for legislative wins and the electoral concerns of their members.</content>

    <title>Why is the Mental Health of the Youngest American Workers in Decline?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The worsening mental health of young workers in the United States drives the disappearance of the U-shape in wellbeing and the hump-shape in illbeing in the last decade.  Illbeing declines in age among workers but is hump-shaped among non-workers across all US states. This has been the case for some time and is apparent in our analyses of two large US datasets with long time runs - the Behavioral Risk Survey System 1993-2025 and the National Health Interview Survey of 1997-2024. Although the mental health of workers and non-workers has been declining it has been deteriorating most quickly among young workers, leading to a steepening in the age gradient of mental illbeing for workers. Improvements in worker wellbeing (and declines in worker illbeing) with age are mirrored in age differences in reported working conditions in the American Job Quality Survey of 2025: six measures of job quality rise with age.  Declines in mental health are most pronounced among the youngest workers ages 18-22 who are likely drawn from lower socio-economic classes and report the greatest difficulties making ends meet.</content>

    <title>Hitting Rock Bottom: Economic Hardship and Cheating</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates whether economic hardship undermines preferences for honesty. We use controlled, high-stake measures of cheating for private benefit in a large sample of 5,664 Kenyans, exploiting three complementary sources of variation: experimentally manipulated monetary incentives to cheat, a randomized increase in the salience of one’s own financial situation, and the Covid‐19 income shock (exploiting randomized survey timing, with respondents interviewed before vs. during the crisis). We find that cheating behavior is highly responsive to financial incentives in the experiment. Covid-19 economic hardship—marked by a 51% drop in monthly earnings—leads to a sharp increase in the prevalence of cheating, and the effect increases gradually with prolonged hardship. The effects are largest among the most economically impacted and are amplified when the salience of one’s own financial situation is experimentally increased. The results demonstrate that while most individuals exhibit a strong preference against cheating under normal conditions (in line with the existing body of work), economic forces can account for a substantial share of variation in dishonesty: the estimated cheating rate rises from 29% under low stakes in normal times to 86% under high stakes during the crisis.</content>

    <title>The Geography of Science</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Science has long been concentrated in the Western world, but the global research landscape is undergoing a profound reorganization. Using data on 44 million publications from 1980 to 2022, we document the geography of science in terms of who produces it, what it studies, and where it diffuses. The share of publications produced in the United States has fallen from 40% in 1980 to 15% in 2022, while China’s share has risen from near-zero to 32%. This pattern extends even to elite outlets, with China now producing over 35% of top-journal publications. Notably, this is driven not only by an expanding researcher base but also—to a large extent—by increases in individual productivity. This growth varies by fields: China leads in the Engineering and Physical Sciences (such as Chemistry), while the US retains its lead in Biomedical and Health Sciences. Moreover, China’s expanding leadership in scientific production has not translated into a commensurate shift in global diffusion and integration. Elite research remains disproportionately focused on US topics (40% of breakthrough publications), and citations to Chinese research disproportionately come from within China rather than from other regions, even for top-tier science. Similar to China, other middle- and low-income countries (including India, Russia, and Brazil) have also expanded output producing as much research as high-income European Union countries combined (about 21% overall) but they remain underrepresented in top-tier journals. Overall, our findings highlight both the democratization and fragmentation of global science, raising important questions about the future of the global scientific enterprise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We define the concept of customer overlap of product j with product k as the share of j's customers who buy k. We then argue that, in appropriate contexts, customer overlaps are an excellent proxy for diversion ratios, a useful and popular way to summarize competition between sellers of substitute products. Unlike diversion ratios, which are often challenging to estimate, customer overlaps are straightforwardly observed in many data sets. We show theoretically, and then validate empirically, the close connection between customer overlaps and diversion ratios. We then illustrate the potential use of customer overlap in contexts where estimation of diversion ratios could be prohibitive.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In today’s developing world, many economies appear to bypass industrialization and transition directly from agriculture to services. The largest rise in service employment has occurred in non-tradable consumer services, such as retail and hospitality, especially in urban areas, where many cities resemble consumer hubs built around local demand. These patterns of growth raise fundamental questions: Can service-led growth sustain a growth of living standards over time? Is service-led growth inherently biased toward affluent urban consumers? What role should policy play? We propose a parsimonious general equilibrium framework that incorporates non-homothetic preferences and locally non-tradable consumer services. Our framework bridges macro and micro perspectives, and enables counterfactual and welfare analysis that accounts for both individual and spatial heterogeneity. We relate our framework to the recent literature and suggest several extensions and directions of future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents new survey evidence on how household spending changes in response to fiscal transfers. Our key finding is that the planned propensity to spend out of transfers equals the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). This result implies that households do not incorporate future tax liabilities into their spending plans. The canonical HANK model cannot account for our survey results because people in that model are overly sensitive to future tax liabilities. We develop an extended HANK model in which households are partially inattentive to future tax liabilities and to the general-equilibrium consequences of fiscal policy. This inattention dampens forward-looking intertemporal MPCs, bringing the model into line with our survey evidence. We use the model to analyze the aggregate effects of fiscal policy changes and find that both transfer and government spending multipliers are larger in the inattentive HANK model than in the canonical HANK framework.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efforts to move care out of hospitals and into the community face a hard constraint: while most medications can be delivered anywhere, diagnosis is still mostly trapped inside the formal health system—clinics, hospitals, and the people and machines inside them. This is especially binding in low- and middle-income countries due to distance, cost, and limited health system capacity. Low-cost data collection devices (e.g., handheld electrocardiograms (ECGs), retinal cameras) are promising, but do not solve the bottleneck: their outputs still require expert interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) could turn these raw signals into actionable outputs at scale, but most medical AI is trained in high-income settings and deteriorates in different populations and settings. We assemble a new dataset in rural Tamil Nadu, India that links low-cost device signals to hospital-grade reference testing. We use it to build a proof-of-concept screening tool: an algorithm that predicts the result of a hospital-based reference-standard test (regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography), using only data from a handheld ECG device (cost: $60). This would allow targeting of secondary prevention medications—high-dose statins, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers—proven to be cost-effective in both high- and low-resource settings. We evaluate predictive performance and cost-effectiveness of such screening, benchmarking against common clinical risk scores (including the American Heart Association 10-year risk score). In a held-out test set, our model identifies subgroups with rates high enough to make screening very cost-effective: the top 2.5% have a 9.3% rate of evidence consistent with prior heart attack—about six times the base rate—delivering benefits at US$1,999 per life-year saved. The model also flags high-yield patients who would be missed by standard clinical scores, underscoring the limits of transporting Western-derived risk tools to low- and middle-income settings. To enable extensions to other conditions in the dataset, we make all data freely available for research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the increased cross-country ownership of financial assets between advanced and emerging economies impacted their financial and macroeconomic volatility. While cross-country ownership improved risk-sharing and reduced volatility associated with financial crises, it also increased the exposure of countries to foreign crises, leading to higher international co-movement. Through quantitative applications of a two-region model representative of advanced and emerging economies, we find that financial globalization reduced volatility worldwide, but significantly more in emerging economies.</content>

    <title>Capital Flows in a World Starved for Liquidity: Analysis and Policy Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a framework for studying financial and macroeconomic dynamics in an environment where liquid assets have a productive use but their supply is limited (i.e., the economy is starved for liquidity). The private demand for financial assets arises from the need to hold them for production. The private supply of financial assets is limited and unstable because of borrowing constraints and default risk. We discuss open-economy applications that analyze the accumulation of foreign reserves by emerging economies, the increase in public debt issued by advanced economies, the rapid growth of emerging economies, structural changes in financial markets, and financial globalization. A key result is that most of these developments led to a decline in interest rates and an increase in global macroeconomic volatility, driven by riskier borrower portfolios.</content>

    <title>How Restrictive is U.S. Trade Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This short note computes Trade Restrictiveness Index measures for current U.S. trade policy. Building on the ideas of Anderson and Neary (1996, 2005), the Trade Restrictiveness Index is the uniform tariff that leaves the U.S. consumer as well off as under actual policy. As of October 2025, U.S. trade policy is twice as restrictive as headline tariff numbers suggest. The Trade Restrictiveness Index is 23 percent, which stands in contrast to the 11 percent average tariff rate. Trade policy towards Canada and Mexico is two to three times more restrictive than average tariff rates suggest. Sectoral analysis shows that the restrictiveness is concentrated in vehicles, machinery, and electrical equipment.</content>

    <title>Unlocking Occupational Opportunity: The Labor Market Effects of DACA</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U.S. laws make it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented migrants. This legal constraint affects which firms will employ unauthorized workers and what jobs undocumented migrants can expect to get. As a result, unauthorized migrants are more likely to end up in jobs that have a lower risk of detection of immigration status and are less desirable. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which began in August 2012, gave temporary legal authorization to work in the U.S. to a subset of undocumented migrants – those who arrived in the U.S. as children meeting certain other eligibility criteria. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the effect of DACA on the occupational outcomes of young adults who arrived in the U.S. as children. Applying this strategy to individual-level data from the American Community Survey, we find that DACA eligibility decreases the likelihood that noncitizen childhood immigrants hold traditional immigrant jobs or jobs with a high risk of injury, and increases the likelihood of holding a government job or jobs that require occupational licensing. On the whole, DACA eligibility shifts noncitizen childhood immigrants to occupations that are higher-paying and employ more educated workers. These findings are consistent with legal barriers constraining undocumented childhood migrants from taking the jobs they are interested in and have the skills for. These workers are shunted to jobs they find less desirable and there are societal losses from the misallocation of talent.</content>

    <title>Community College Bachelor’s Degrees: How CCB Graduates’ Earnings Compare to AAs and BAs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first descriptive analysis of the economic value of Community College Baccalaureate (CCB) degrees by examining graduates’ early-career earnings, the costs of completing these programs, and the alignment between field of study and subsequent employment. Using administrative data and controlling for institution and field, we find that CCB graduates earn $4,000 to $9,000 more annually than Associate’s (AA) degree holders one year after graduation but experience average earnings penalties of roughly $2,000 relative to traditional Bachelor’s (BA) recipients. These averages mask substantial heterogeneity: penalties are largest in Computer and Information Technology and Engineering Technology, whereas CCB graduates in Nursing, other Healthcare fields, Business, and Criminal Justice exhibit minimal or no penalties. To contextualize these returns, we analyze tuition and fee structures across CCB-granting institutions and identify two dominant pricing models—constant and escalating. Total CCB program costs fall between those of AA and BA degrees, with escalating structures increasing upper-division prices by about 40 percent. Finally, we examine field-to-industry match patterns and find that CCB graduates in fields with well-defined occupational pathways, such as Health Professions and Education, are highly concentrated in aligned industries, while graduates in more diffuse fields, such as Computer Science, are more broadly dispersed.</content>

    <title>Monopsony, Markdowns, and Minimum Wages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents the first direct test of two interlinked predictions at the core of the monopsony theory of the labor market: (i) that firms exploit wage-setting power by marking down wages below the marginal revenue product of labor, and (ii) that exogenous wage constraints, if binding, eliminate markdowns. Our research design revisits the 2015 introduction of a high minimum wage in Germany. Drawing on a monopsony model, we derive an empirically tractable difference-in-differences specification that provides a quantitative benchmark for the firm-level markdown response. Our main result is that empirical markdowns respond only 0–25% as much as the monopsony model would have predicted. Hence, at least for the labor market segment we study, (i) markdowns largely reflect other distortions than monopsony, (ii) markdowns are mismeasured, (iii) minimum wages induce widespread labor shortages, or (iv) the standard monopsony model does not provide a full, realistic account of the labor market.</content>

    <title>Subcontracting in Federal Spending: Micro and Macro Implications</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the critical but underexplored role of subcontracting in shaping the spatial and firm-level effects of federal government spending. Using newly available data on defense subcontract awards linked to establishment-level data from NETS, we examine prime–subcontractor relationships across regions, industries, and over time. We document three key facts. First, subcontracting reallocates a substantial share of federal dollars across geographic areas, weakening the link between the location of prime contracts and where spending ultimately occurs. Second, subcontracting shifts spending across industries, notably from service-sector primes to manufacturing subcontractors. Third, large firms dominate subcontracting networks, including by receiving subcontracts from smaller primes. Accounting for geographic reallocation implies that conventional estimates understate local fiscal multipliers by about 20%. Furthermore, local multipliers are smaller for subcontracting than for prime contracting, partly because subcontracted spending is concentrated among large manufacturing firms that exhibit more muted employment responses. Establishment-level evidence further shows that subcontracting generates weaker employment effects, even conditional on firm size and industry, reflecting the less stable nature of subcontracting relationships. Overall, our findings show that subcontracting fundamentally reshapes the transmission of procurement spending through the private sector, with important implications for the local and aggregate effects of federal spending.</content>

    <title>Topography of the FX Derivatives Market: A View from London</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on 100 million transactions, we show how speculators, hedgers, and market makers interact in the world’s largest FX derivatives market, and that derivatives trading can affect exchange rates. Firms in the largest client sectors—pension and investment funds, insurers, and nonfinancials—use FX derivatives primarily to hedge currency risk, with dealer banks providing the liquidity. Hedge funds, with comparatively smaller net exposures, trade speculatively, whereas dealer banks insulate themselves from changes in speculative demand by taking offsetting positions with hedgers, especially nonfinancials. Non-bank market makers, instead, take residual exchange-rate exposures “on the margin”. Hedge funds’ speculative flows help transmit monetary policy shocks to exchange rates, while investment funds' unwinding of hedges contribute to dollar appreciations when credit risk rises. Our results highlight that exchange rates depend on the composition of trading activities in FX derivatives markets.</content>
