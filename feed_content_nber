    <title>Tariffs and Trade Deficits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic multi-country Ricardian trade model with aggregate uncertainty, where countries trade goods and assets, leading to trade imbalances. We introduce a method for computing counterfactuals in this setting without specifying the stochastic process of shocks or solving for asset prices. Applying the model to tariff shocks, we quantify their effects on prices, income, expenditure, and trade imbalances. We find that higher U.S. tariffs reduce the U.S. trade deficit through general equilibrium adjustments, but raise domestic prices and lower real consumption. Our findings highlight that movements in trade imbalances are shaped by the structure of global trade and finance, and that attempts to influence external balances through changes in trade barriers carry significant implications for real economic outcomes.</content>

    <title>Central Banks as Educators</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, central bankers’ speeches and other forms of communication have become pedagogical in nature, aiming to shape public knowledge, beliefs, expectations, and attitudes. With the shift toward expectations management as a monetary policy tool, central banks’ educational role has become a central component of their monetary policymaking, and central bank communication with the public has become a rapidly-growing area of research. I argue that this research is closely related, both thematically and methodologically, to the field of educational psychology. I discuss insights from educational psychology research that could guide central bank communication research—including insights about the challenges and pitfalls that both fields share.</content>

    <title>Due Diligence and the Allocation of Venture Capital</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do investors choose the intensity of their due diligence, and how does that choice affect investment outcomes? Using cell phone signal data, we measure the duration of pre-investment meetings between venture capitalists (VCs) and startup employees. This measure captures one important component of VC due diligence. Less due diligence is associated with hotter deals and markets, busier investors, and greater distance, consistent with a theory of costly learning. Also consistent with that theory, less due diligence is associated with more volatile investment performance, as VCs allocate capital under greater uncertainty. Overall, VCs appear to trade off the costs of due diligence with its improvements to capital allocation.</content>

    <title>Carbon Rollercoaster: A Historical Analysis of Decarbonization in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents the evolution of US carbon emissions and discusses the main factors that contributed to the historical carbon emissions rollercoaster. We divide the discussion into four periods – up to 1920, 1920-1960, 1960-2005 and after 2005. For each period, we discuss the main drivers of national carbon emissions. We then discuss trends in carbon emissions in the electricity sector. Electricity sector emissions were initially very small, but would become the largest source of US carbon emissions over the period 1980-2015, and the largest contributor to decarbonization since 2007. In the final section, we distill lessons from the U.S. experience that may inform decarbonization strategies in developing economies.</content>

    <title>When Do Migrants Shape Culture?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the impacts of migrants on the culture of their destinations. Migrants often assimilate to local social norms and practices, but they also tend to maintain their own culture. Sometimes, beyond preserving their culture, they influence their new neighbors. We propose a conceptual framework to understand when migrants shape culture at their destination—and how. We identify two key conditions for influence (ideological intensity and power structure) and three channels of influence (cultural spillovers, organizational mobilization, and political leverage). We combine insights from political economy, social psychology, and evolutionary approaches to illuminate pathways of influence in historical perspective. Our review offers a new perspective on the mechanisms of cultural transmission, using illustrative cases to characterize the various ways in which migrants shape culture in their destinations.</content>

    <title>Productivity Beliefs and Efficiency in Science</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Fabio Bertolotti, Kyle R. Myers &amp; Wei Yang Tham</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a method to estimate producers’ productivity beliefs in settings where output quantities and input prices are unobservable, and we use it to evaluate allocative efficiency in the market for science. Our model of researchers’ labor supply shows that their willingness to pay for their two key inputs, funding and time, reveals their underlying productivity beliefs. We estimate the model’s parameters using data from a nationally representative survey of research-active professors from all major fields of science. We find that the distribution of research productivity is highly skewed. Using these estimates, we assess the market’s allocative efficiency by comparing actual input allocations to optimal allocations given various objectives. Overall, the market for science is moderately efficient at maximizing output and researchers’ utility: actual input levels are positively correlated with the optimal levels implied by the model. However, the wedge between researchers’ actual and optimal input levels is often significant and difficult to predict. Our estimates imply that total budgets would need to increase by roughly 40% under actual allocations in order to achieve the same growth in scientific output that we predict under alternative allocations of the current budget. Scaling to the population level, this equates to billions of dollars in funding — there are substantial gains from developing new ways of identifying and supporting productive scientists.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new rule-based linking method for historical Census records. We augment earlier algorithms based on name, age and place of birth (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2012, or “basic ABE”), with five matching characteristics – middle initial, county of residence, and spouse and parents’ names. Relative to basic ABE, ABE-Extra Information (“ABE-EI”) greatly increases match rates, improves accuracy and is similarly representative of the population on most attributes, with geographic mobility being one important exception. Relative to machine learning algorithms, ABE-EI has somewhat lower match rates, improved representativeness, and offers full replicability. We also create the first ABE-based links for women.</content>

    <title>Credit Scores and Inequality across the Life Cycle</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Credit scores are a primary screening device for the allocation of credit, housing, and sometimes even employment. In the data, credit scores grow and fan out with age; at the same time, income and consumption inequality also increase with a cohort’s age. We postulate a simple model with hidden information to explore the joint determination of credit scores, income, and consumption over an individual’s lifetime which can replicate these empirical facts. We use the model to understand the role of technologies like big data or legal restrictions limiting information on certain adverse events like medical expenses intended to increase credit market access.</content>

    <title>Digital Media Mergers: Theory and Application to Facebook-Instagram</title>

      <name>Justin Katz &amp; Hunt Allcott</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a new model of competition between digital media platforms with targeted advertising. The model adds new insights around how user heterogeneity and overlap, along with user and advertiser substitution patterns, determine equilibrium ad load. We apply the model to evaluate the proposed separation of Facebook and Instagram. We estimate structural parameters using evidence on diminishing returns to advertising from a new randomized experiment and information on user overlap, diversion ratios, and price elasticity from earlier experiments. In counterfactual simulations, a Facebook-Instagram separation increases ad loads, transferring surplus from platforms and users to advertisers, with limited total surplus effects.</content>

    <title>Revisiting the Interest Rate Effects of Federal Debt</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the relationship between federal debt and interest rates, which is a key input for assessments of fiscal sustainability. Estimating this relationship is challenging due to confounding effects from business cycle dynamics and changes in monetary policy. A common approach is to regress long-term forward interest rates on long-term projections of federal debt. We show that issues regarding nonstationarity have become far more pronounced over the last 20 years, significantly biasing the recent estimates based on this methodology. Estimating the model in first differences addresses these concerns. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio raises the 5-year-ahead, 5-year Treasury rate by about 3 basis points, which is statistically and economically significant and highly robust. Roughly three-quarters of the increase in interest rates reflects term premia rather than expected short-term real rates.</content>

    <title>Unpriced Risks: Rethinking Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Characteristic-based factors embed large unpriced components that depress Sharpe ratios and deviate from the mean-variance efficient (MVE) frontier. We discuss how to decompose tradable factor returns into priced (MVE) and unpriced components, showing that hedging unpriced variation realigns factors with efficiency. We outline theoretical conditions for characteristic portfolios to span the MVE and describe practical hedge-portfolio construction. In some asset classes—currencies and sovereign bonds—real-time estimation of the MVE is feasible. In the case of equities, one can hedge unpriced risks from characteristic-based factors. Empirically, unpriced risks account for 30–99% of factor return variance, and hedging can more than double Sharpe ratios.</content>

    <title>Eurosclerosis at 40: Labor Market Institutions, Dynamism, and European Competitiveness</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Benjamin Schoefer</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores a repositioning of Europe’s labor market institutions as potential drivers of the transatlantic gap in macroeconomic performance. Institutional diagnoses were prominent in times of high European unemployment in the 1980-90s. But interest waned as joblessness fell—even though the decline was uneven, precarious work arrangements have grown, and labor markets remain largely unreformed (unlike product and financial markets). Yet, rigid labor market institutions might continue to matter because they can stifle labor market and business dynamism: Europeans switch jobs much less frequently, and restructuring is much rarer. Recent research argues that such immobility impedes wage and productivity growth. Moreover, this low dynamism might contribute to Europe’s specific underperformance in tech, R&amp;D, disruptive innovation, ICT adoption—where creative destruction requires fluid reallocation. This institutional labor market perspective on European competitiveness complements prevailing diagnoses focused on capital and product market fragmentation. Tight labor markets, lower unemployment, and shrinking labor supply might keep this nexus timely.</content>

    <title>Adaptive Priority Mechanisms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should authorities that care about match quality and diversity allocate resources in the face of uncertainty? We introduce adaptive priority mechanisms (APM) that prioritize agents based on their scores and characteristics. We show that APM uniquely implement the ex post optimal allocation. The ubiquitous priority and quota mechanisms are optimal if and only if the authority is risk-neutral or extremely risk-averse over diversity, respectively. Deferred Acceptance implements the unique stable matching when all authorities use the optimal APM. We provide a practical roadmap for implementing APM as a market-design solution and illustrate this using Chicago Public Schools data.</content>

    <title>Rounding up the Effect of Tariffs on Financial Markets: Evidence from April 2, 2025</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the response of financial outcomes to the US announcement on April 2, 2025, of tariffs on nearly all its trading partners. To address the challenge posed by potential anticipation by economic agents, we decompose these tariffs into a component associated with bilateral deficits and an arguably unanticipated component resulting from the rounding up of the continuous deficit measure to the next whole number or to the baseline 10% rate. We measure the short-term response of stock prices and exchange rates, focusing on all countries with which the US has a bilateral deficit. For both outcomes, the round-up component’s effect is an order of magnitude larger than that of the deficit component. We find that a one percentage point higher tariff is associated with a statistically significant 0.23% decline in stock prices. Further, we find no evidence of a dollar appreciation; if anything, higher tariffs are associated with a dollar depreciation, driven by countries with a floating regime. We show this is consistent with a model that allows for trade reallocation and in which exports to the US are invoiced in dollars while exports to the rest of the world are partly invoiced in producer currency.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Bicycles for the Mind</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Ajay K. Agrawal, Joshua S. Gans &amp; Avi Goldfarb</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Steve Jobs described computers as “bicycles for the mind,” a tool that allowed people to dramatically leverage their capabilities. This paper presents a formal model of cognitive tools and technologies that enhance mental capabilities. We consider agents engaged in iterative task improvement, where cognitive tools are assumed to be substitutes for implementation skills and may or may not be complements to judgment, depending on their type. The ability to recognise opportunities to start or improve a process, which we term opportunity judgment, is shown to always complement cognitive tools. The ability to know which action to take in a given state, which we term payoff judgment, is not necessarily a complement to cognitive tools. Using these concepts, we can synthesise the empirical literature on the impact of computers and artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity and inequality. Specifically, while both computers and AI appear to increase productivity, computers have also contributed to increased inequality. Empirical work on the impact of AI on inequality has shown both increases and decreases, depending on the context. We also apply the model to understand how cognitive tools might influence incentives to automate processes and allocate decision-making authority within teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of state hospital regulations intended to increase breastfeeding by requiring certain care standards during the postpartum hospital stay. Policy adoption increased breastfeeding initiation by 3.3–4.1 percentage points (4.2–5.2 percent) and breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum by 6–9 percent. Further, following adoption, infant mortality declined by 0.2 deaths per 1,000 live births (3.5 percent), and infant hospitalization charges fell. Declines in mortality and charges primarily occurred among medically vulnerable infants, consistent with evidence that breast milk supports immune development. Additional evidence suggests that improvements in infant sleep practices also played a role in reducing mortality.</content>

    <title>Did California's Fast Food Minimum Wage Reduce Employment?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effect of California's $20 fast food minimum wage, which was enacted in September 2023 and went into effect in April 2024, on employment in the fast food sector. In unadjusted data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that employment in California's fast food sector declined by 2.7 percent relative to employment in the fast food sector elsewhere in the United States from September 2023 through September 2024. Adjusting for pre-AB 1228 trends increases this differential decline to 3.2 percent, while netting out the equivalent employment changes in non-minimum-wage-intensive industries further increases the decline. Our median estimate translates into a loss of 18,000 jobs in California's fast food sector relative to the counterfactual.</content>

    <title>Does Universal Occupational Licensing Recognition Improve Patient Access? Evidence from Healthcare Utilization</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing state and regional physician labor supply has been an important policy issue in healthcare in the United States. One of the proposed solutions has been the universal licensing recognition (ULR), which allows out-of-state physicians to provide healthcare services without relicensing and increases the local labor supply of physicians. There has been no empirical analysis of the effect of such regulatory relaxation on the local labor supply and subsequent improvements of consumer welfare. In this study, we use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to investigate the effect of universal reciprocity of physician licenses on healthcare utilization, and use data from IPUMS-USA, IPUMS-CPS, and the Doctors and Clinicians National Downloadable File from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to examine the changes in the local labor supply of physicians through interstate migration and out-of-state practices. Our results show that adopting the ULR significantly raises the proportion of individuals accessing healthcare, particularly among older individuals, and reduces the proportion of individuals not getting healthcare services because of costs. We provide empirical evidence that these effects are from the universal reciprocity of physician licenses, instead of unknown factors related to the ULR. We also show that the positive effect of the ULR on healthcare utilization is closely related to the increase in out-of-state practitioners to include temporary and telehealth physicians, by showing no changes in interstate migration of physicians and an increase in out-of-state practices. The adoption of ULR may allow for a more efficient regional distribution of physicians and result in greater access to healthcare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a large-scale field experiment in Granada, Spain, to assess the motivating effect on blood donation of matching each attempt to donate with a charitable contribution pledge for children in developing countries. The intervention involved 344 blood drives and 21,888 participants. Compared to a control condition with no pledges, the pro-social incentives significantly increased blood donation rates by approximately 5% on average. Offering a day or a week’s worth of food for vulnerable populations led to the largest and most robust increases in donations, and repeated exposure to incentives had a reinforcing effect on subsequent donation behavior, especially for individuals who previously donated when incentivized. An auxiliary survey examining the perceived importance and motivational impact of food-related incentives corroborates our findings. Our results suggest that coordination between blood donation campaigns and humanitarian aid programs could enhance the blood supply at minimal additional cost. More broadly, policymakers and nonprofit organizations can align global and local altruism by linking humanitarian assistance with initiatives promoting civic engagement and public health.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does industrial concentration shape the life and death of cities? We identify settlements from historical maps of England and Wales (1790–1820), isolate exogenous variation in their late 19th-century size and industrial concentration, and estimate the causal impact of size and concentration on later dynamics. Industrial concentration has a negative effect on long-run productivity—independent of industry trends and consistent with cross-industry Jacobs externalities. A spatial model quantifies the role of fundamentals, industry trends, and Jacobs externalities in shaping industry-city dynamics and isolates a new, dynamic trade-off in the design of place-based policies.</content>

    <title>Government Monitoring of Health Care Quality: Evidence from the Nursing Home Sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In contracting out, monitoring is an important policy tool to extract information on firm quality and incentivize quality provision. This paper examines a central quality inspection of nursing homes, a sector with significant welfare implications but widespread public concerns about its quality of care. Using data on nursing homes across the US, we find that nursing homes exhibit strategic responses to the inspection. Nursing homes increase the quantity and quality of labor inputs, reduce admissions, increase temporary discharges, and improve patient care in response to the inspection. However, nearly all responses described above drop immediately once the inspection is completed. While inspection rating is unlikely to reflect nursing homes’ absolute quality given the strategic responses, using a quasi-experimental research design we find that inspection rating predicts nursing homes’ relative quality. Finally, we examine the effects of quality deficiency citations issued by the inspection on incentivizing nursing homes to improve quality of care, finding mixed impacts.</content>

    <title>The Illusion of Time: Gender Gaps in Job Search and Employment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In countries with low female employment, college-educated women often transition directly from education to homemaking. Does this reflect informed, forward-looking choices or unanticipated constraints? We study this question in Pakistan, where two-thirds of college-educated women remain out of the labor force. Tracking 2,400 college-graduating students, we document that men and women start their search with similar work aspirations, apply at similar rates, and receive comparable numbers of job offers. Yet a 27 pp employment gap emerges within six months post-graduation. This gap stems largely from timing: for women alone, there is a critical window, immediately post-graduation, during which job search is associated with much higher chances of employment. To test whether this relationship is causal, we randomize a modest incentive to apply early. By shifting search into the early window, the intervention raises women’s employment by ∼ 20% but leaves men’s employment unaffected, closing a third of the gender gap. Our evidence suggests that applying early enables women to start working before demands from the marriage market arise. Treatment effects are driven by women who underestimate how quickly these demands materialize, revealing an “illusion of time.” This illusion can be persistent since women in our sample recognize the barriers to employment faced by their female peers, but overestimate their own ability to overcome them.</content>

    <title>Targeting Distributional Impacts in the Presence of Behavioral Responses: Lessons from Maritime Emissions Regulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Targeting distributional impacts is gaining importance in the design of environmental policy. To achieve this, policy makers are adopting advances in air transport models to predict the benefits of air emissions regulation. These models offer policy makers accuracy in the spatial distribution of ambient air quality improvements for a given emissions reduction, but do not take into account behavioral responses to environmental policies. We consider how the failure to account for behavioral responses when making policy predictions may have important implications for the ultimate distributional impact of such policies. We compare the distributional impacts of maritime emission regulation predicted from the policy maker's air transport model to the realized distributional impacts. We then decompose the prediction error from two components: model error, whereby the predictions of air transport models fail to account for behavioral responses of polluting firms, and sorting error, whereby the targeted population migrates.</content>

    <title>Greener on the Other Side: Inequity and Tax Compliance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments frequently use proxies for deservingness—tags—to implement progressive tax and transfer policies. These proxies are often imperfect, leading to misclassification and inequities among equally deserving individuals. This paper studies the efficiency effects of such misclassification in the context of the property tax system in Manaus, Brazil. We leverage quasi-experimental variation in inequity generated by the boundaries of geographic sectors used to compute tax liabilities and a large tax reform in a series of augmented boundary discontinuity designs. We find that inequities significantly reduce tax compliance. The elasticity of compliance with respect to inequity is between 0.12 and 0.25, accounting for half of the overall change in compliance at the boundaries. A simple model of presumptive property taxation shows how mistagging affects the optimal tax schedule, highlighting the opposite implications of responses to the level of taxation and to inequity for optimal tax progressivity. Interpreting our findings through the lens of the model implies that optimal progressivity is around 50% lower than it would be absent inequity responses. These results underscore the importance of inequity for public policy design, especially in contexts with low fiscal capacity.</content>

    <title>Credit Access in the United States</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct new population-level linked administrative data to study households’ access to credit in the United States. By age 25, Black adults, those who grew up in low-income families, and those raised in the Southeast or Appalachia already have significantly lower credit scores than other groups, and these differences persist throughout adulthood. These gaps translate into smaller credit balances, more credit inquiries, higher credit utilization, and greater reliance on high-cost alternative financial services. Evaluating two definitions of algorithmic bias yields opposing results. Scores are miscalibrated against traditionally advantaged groups: conditional on a score, Black and low-parental-income individuals fall delinquent more often. Yet scores are unbalanced against traditionally disadvantaged groups: among borrowers with no future delinquency, Black and low-parental-income individuals receive lower scores. Eliminating both biases and reducing gaps in credit access requires reducing systematic differences in delinquencies, which emerge in one’s twenties through missed payments on credit cards, student loans, and other bills. Comprehensive measures of individuals’ income profiles and observed wealth explain only a small portion of these repayment gaps. In contrast, most geographic variation in repayment reflects the causal effect of childhood exposure to place. Counties that promote upward mobility also promote repayment and expand credit access, suggesting that common place-level factors may drive behaviors in both credit and labor markets. We discuss suggestive evidence for several mechanisms of our results, including the role of social and cultural capital. We conclude that gaps in credit access by race, class, and hometown have roots in childhood environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low-cost private schools have increased educational access in low-income countries, but frequent school closures lead to costly disruptions in children’s schooling. We provide experimental evidence from Pakistan that both school loans and educational products and services (EPS) are (a) commercially viable products and (b) substantially and similarly improve school survival rates. Moreover, loans decrease closure rates more for schools with larger initial enrollments and lower baseline test scores, while EPS show no such differential impact. These results demonstrate how financial and educational input constraints can significantly affect school survival while underscoring that the fungibility of entrepreneurial support matters.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between green innovation and the business cycle, revealing that while non-green innovation is procyclical, green innovation is countercyclical. This pattern holds unconditionally over the business cycle and conditional on economic shocks. Motivated by these findings, we develop a business cycle model with endogenous green and non-green innovation to explain their distinct cyclical behavior. The key mechanism operates through a ‘green is in the future’ channel: green patents are expected to generate higher profits in the future, making green patenting less sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations. In general equilibrium, this channel is reinforced, making green and non-green innovation effective substitutes. We provide direct evidence supporting the model mechanism using data on market-implied values of green and non-green patents.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do corporate control transactions discipline the labor force? Consistent with synergies, new disclosures of employee misconduct in the investment advisory industry drop by between 17 and 22 percent following mergers. Both targets and acquirers have better pre-merger misconduct records than the industry’s average firm and, within the subsample of merging firms, there is assortative matching on misconduct. Merger events facilitate further reductions in misconduct through separations of target firm employees with high misconduct. Many of these employees remain in the industry, suggesting that consolidation plays an important role in the redistribution of misconduct across firms.</content>

    <title>How Do Tax Incentives Influence Employer Decisions to Offer Retirement Benefits?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, policy makers have adopted many measures to incentivize the establishment of employer-sponsored retirement plans (ESRPs). One such measure – implemented in the early 2000s and made more generous in recent years – allows smaller firms that establish an ESRP to claim a tax credit to offset part of their costs during the initial years. We examine firm take-up of this credit. We find that only 1 percent (pre-policy expansion) to 5.5 percent (post-policy expansion) of apparently eligible firms claim the credit. We document heterogeneity in credit take-up rates by industry, firm owner education, and use of tax preparation services. We also document evidence of “tax preparer learning,” whereby take-up among a tax preparer’s clients increases after that preparer files their first credit. Finally, we document that most firms only claim the credit for one year despite being eligible to do so for up to three years.</content>

    <title>The Aggregate Welfare and Trade Implications of Contracting Frictions in Global Sourcing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much do contracting frictions between global firms and their suppliers impact country welfare and trade? We answer this by developing a model of global sourcing under partial contractibility, where firm-supplier relationships are exposed to a bilateral holdup problem. Sourcing decisions aggregate into a gravity equation for trade flows by organizational mode (intrafirm vs. arm’s length), which we take to structural estimation. We can then evaluate welfare changes with an extended Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) formula that incorporates these contracting frictions. Our counterfactual analysis reveals a sizeable average country welfare gain of 9.2% from eliminating contracting frictions in global sourcing. We further show how accounting for these frictions significantly reshapes quantitative assessments of the welfare gains from trade, including the stakes in a US-China decoupling scenario.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To increase a company’s earnings, a project must generate enough income next year to pay for its own financing. Hence, a manager who wants to maximize her EPS (earnings per share) should only invest in accretive projects that have income yields above the firm’s cheapest financing option. This is the max EPS analog to the positive-NPV (net present value) rule. Maximizing EPS ≠ minimizing investment. EPS maximizers use real investment to arbitrage between asset and capital markets. This framework rationalizes the pervasive use of IRRs (internal rates of return) and payback periods. An IRR effectively measures how accretive a project will be. A payback period expresses the project’s income yield as a multiple. Empirically, a simple max EPS model explains M&amp;A payment method and investment-cash flow sensitivity. It also predicts which firms have higher proportions of convertible debt and capitalized interest expense.</content>

    <title>Tax Reform and the Laffer Curve</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper evaluates Laffer curves produced by reforms to nonlinear income taxes, focusing on individual taxpayers. A reform puts a taxpayer on the “wrong” side of the Laffer curve if it increases their tax burden while reducing tax payments. There always exist potential reforms with this property – and in particular, tax increases restricted to high-income taxpayers are guaranteed to consign some to the wrong side of the Laffer curve. The original design of the 2024 Australian tax reform would have put 15% of the taxpaying population on the wrong side of the Laffer curve, though subsequent modifications reduced this to 5%. Standard tax progressivity measures that ignore the endogeneity of taxable income generally understate the redistributive impact of progressive tax reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The integration of algorithmic trading with reinforcement learning, termed AI-powered trading, is transforming financial markets. Alongside the benefits, it raises concerns for collusion. This study first develops a model to explore the possibility of collusion among informed speculators in a theoretical environment. We then conduct simulation experiments, replacing the speculators in the model with informed AI speculators who trade based on reinforcement-learning algorithms. We show that they autonomously sustain collusive supra-competitive profits without agreement, communication, or intent. Such collusion undermines competition and market efficiency. We demonstrate that two separate mechanisms are underlying this collusion and characterize when each one arises.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U.S. President Trump’s emphasis on ‘tariff reciprocity’ has focused public attention on relative height of tariffs as a measure of fairness in trade relations. The importweighted average tariff subsequently used by USTR to rank how protectionist are trading partners is atheoretic and misleading for this purpose. We propose and implement a theory-consistent tariff index that combines thousands of tariff rates into an import volume equivalent uniform tariff. The index: (i) is consistent with the WTO principle that trade relations should aim at reciprocal exchange of market access, and (ii) decomposes neatly into each country’s buyer and seller incidence of tariffs.</content>

    <title>Beyond Bonferroni: Hierarchical Multiple Testing in Empirical Research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical research in the social and medical sciences frequently involves testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, increasing the risk of false positives due to chance. Classical multiple testing procedures, such as the Bonferroni correction, control the family-wise error rate (FWER) but tend to be overly conservative, reducing statistical power. Stepwise alternatives like the Holm and Hochberg procedures offer improved power while maintaining error control under certain dependence structures. However, these standard approaches typically ignore hierarchical relationships among hypotheses—structures that are common in settings such as clinical trials and program evaluations, where outcomes are often logically or causally linked. Hierarchical multiple testing procedures—including fixed sequence, fallback, and gatekeeping methods—explicitly incorporate these relationships, providing more powerful and interpretable frameworks for inference. This paper reviews key hierarchical methods, compares their statistical properties and practical trade-offs, and discusses implications for applied empirical research.</content>

    <title>Looking Backward: Long-Term Religious Service Attendance in 66 Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The attendance rate at religious services is an important variable for the sociology and economics of religion, but long-term and global data are scarce. Retrospective questions from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) allow the construction of rates of religious-service attendance back as far as the 1920s in 66 countries, half from the “Global South.”  A number of checks support the reliability of the retrospective information. One exercise demonstrates the consistency between retrospective and contemporaneous survey data when the two overlap. Another procedure shows that the retrospective values are similar when generated from individual ISSP surveys for 1991, 1998, 2008, and 2018; that is, there is no clear dependence of memory on the number of years of recall. The new data document a century-long “Great Religious Divergence” between North and South. We use the data to carry out event studies for effects on religious-service attendance of two major events.  Vatican II, in 1962-1965, triggered a decline in worldwide Catholic attendance relative to that in other denominations. In contrast, the endings of Communism in the early 1990s did not systematically affect religious-service attendance. Finally, in a large sample, religious-service attendance responds positively to wars and depressions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents new evidence on the critical role of lower-level organizational leaders. Unlike top managers, frontline leaders are essential for implementing organizational strategies by maintaining team cohesion when shirking is profitable for workers. We study this in the context of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, using data on 2.2 million soldiers and tracking captains and their 100-soldier companies at weekly frequency throughout the conflict. We estimate leader fixed effects during non-combat weeks to measure leadership quality in a leader value-added framework. We validate this measure by showing that captains were not assigned based on prior unit performance or observable pre-war characteristics. High-quality leaders earned more after the war, but not before, and were more frequently recognized as good leaders in their postwar biographies. Daily event-study estimates around major battles show that better captains significantly reduced desertions in combat. Exploiting quasi-random leader turnover, we find evidence that this effect is causal. Using digitized battle maps, we rule out risk aversion as a mechanism and find instead that better leaders had higher mortality rates, consistent with a leading-by-example explanation. We also document modest learning-by-doing effects. These findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of frontline leadership, where direct supervision and interpersonal influence are strongest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of job transitions and firm pay policies in the Black-White earnings gap in the US. We use administrative data for the universe of employer-employee matches from 2005-2019 to analyze worker mobility in a general but tractable framework, which allows for firm effects that depend on workers’ job history. Using differences in average pay between origin and destination firms as the treatment intensity of a job move, we analyze transitions up and down the job ladder and estimate race-specific passthrough rates of average firm pay into a mover’s own earnings. First, we find race-specific asymmetry around the direction of the move, whereby losses experienced in downward transitions are meaningfully larger than gains from upward transitions with a similar treatment intensity. For a $1 earnings increase in transitions up the job ladder, earnings passthroughs in transitions down the job ladder impose an earnings loss of $1.25 among White workers and $1.50 among Black workers. Second, we uncover career setbacks as a novel pathway in the evolution of racial earnings gaps. In transitions down the job ladder, Black workers lose an additional $0.24 for every $1 decrease in White workers’ earnings, a finding which prevails across sex and age. This “racial penalty” is not driven by differential pay, as it is completely absent when Black and White workers move between the same firm pairs. Instead, the penalty is due to differential sorting following career setbacks, so that Black workers regain employment in “worse” jobs, with strong evidence for racial differences in access to short-run liquidity as a mechanism. Overall, our findings offer a robust and computationally simple framework for modeling earnings determination processes and have implications for safety-net policies in the American labor market.</content>

    <title>Economic Crisis and Disillusionment from Socialism: Evidence From a Quasi-Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While many socialist countries suffered from harsh economic crises, studying their impacts on economic and political attitudes is challenging because of the scarcity of reliable data in nondemocratic contexts. We study a democratic socialist setting where we have ample information on such attitudes: the Israeli kibbutzim. Exploiting an economic crisis that hit some kibbutzim more than others, we find that the crisis led to reduced support for leftist political parties. This effect persisted for over 20 years after the crisis had ended. We document that the electoral movement was rooted in a rightward shift in economic attitudes, suggesting that economic crises may undermine socialist regimes by silently changing attitudes toward them. In our unique setting, we can also study recovery mechanisms from the crisis. First, we find that while a sharp debt relief arrangement restored trust in the leadership, it did not reverse the impact of the crisis on economic attitudes. Second, as part of their efforts to recover from the crisis, kibbutzim liberalized their labor markets. Analyzing the staggered shift away from equal sharing to market-based wages, we find that this labor market liberalization led kibbutz members to move further rightward in their political voting and economic attitudes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of temperature during the growing season on household diets in the subsequent year in rural India, a setting with a high prevalence of small family farms. High growing season temperatures reduce crop yields, which would presumably reduce incomes and home-grown food for consumption. However, household adaptation could mitigate how the reductions in yields affect diets. We find that heat increases the number of strongly undernourished households in the subsequent year, as measured by the consumption of calories, iron, zinc, thiamine, and niacin. We also find suggestive evidence that households adapt to heat-induced losses of home-grown crops by purchasing more food.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an experimental framework to identify the belief-based and taste-based drivers of demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) partnerships. Our study implements two symmetric experiments with real startup founders and venture capital (VC) investors, who evaluate hypothetical profiles under the understanding that their responses will inform an algorithm generating personalized real-world matches. We find a significant ESG penalty: profiles randomly labeled with ESG attributes receive substantially lower collaboration interest from both founders and VCs. This penalty is primarily driven by negative performance beliefs—ESG-labeled profiles are perceived as less profitable and less accessible. To isolate taste-based preferences, we further implement a willingness-to-pay experiment in which participants may forgo part of a lottery reward to receive additional match recommendations of comparable quality. Participants randomly offered ESG-oriented recommendations are now significantly more likely to pay, revealing a latent preference for ESG once performance concerns are held constant. These findings highlight a tension between financial returns and personal values: in current market conditions, concerns about profitability obscure an underlying taste for ESG.</content>

    <title>A Trade-off Between Monetary Policy Transmission and Systemic Risk in China</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how interbank wholesale funding shapes the transmission of interest-rate-based monetary policy in China and contributes to systemic risk. Using a bank-level quarterly panel dataset and an estimated policy rule for the 7-day repo rate, we find that access to wholesale funding amplifies the transmission of monetary policy easing to lending by non-state banks, but also heightens their vulnerability to systemic risk during economic downturns. Since 2018, non-state banks with greater reliance on wholesale funding have experienced larger increases in expected capital shortfalls. To interpret these findings, we develop a structural model that incorporates a dual-track interest rate system and a segmented deposit market. The model quantifies the role of a liquidity reallocation channel from state to non-state banks and reveals a macroprudential trade-off: tighter regulation of wholesale funding weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy but mitigates systemic risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses longitudinal data to study the benefits of participation in scholastic athletics starting with high school participation and continuing with college athletics, including the benefits of intramural athletics. We study the impact of participation on a number of important life outcomes, including graduation from high school and college and wages after schooling is completed. Controlling for rich measures of cognitive and personality skills and social background, we find substantial benefits at all levels. Participation in athletics promotes social mobility for disadvantaged and minority students.</content>

    <title>Are Hospital Acquisitions of Physician Practices Anticompetitive?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper empirically analyzes the effects of mergers between complementary firms on competition and pricing. As these non-horizontal mergers have become more common, there is increasing interest in evaluating both potential efficiencies such as eliminating double marginalization and potential anticompetitive effects such as foreclosure and recapture. The mergers we study – hospital acquisitions of physician practices – have reshaped the $1 trillion US physician industry, nearly doubling the share of physicians working for hospitals between 2008 and 2016. We combine novel data and machine learning algorithms to identify a large number of integration events, spanning a wide range of markets with different competitive circumstances. We merge the integration events with claims data from a large national insurer to study their effects on prices. Focusing on childbirths, the most ubiquitous admission among the privately insured, we find that, on average, these mergers led to price increases for hospitals and physicians of 3.3% and 15.1%, respectively, with no discernible effects on quality measures. Using demand estimation to characterize substitution patterns for both physicians and hospitals, we construct tests that demonstrate price increases are larger among transactions with greater scope for foreclosure and recapture. Our estimates suggest that the costs of these mergers of hospitals and physicians have been substantial, and our mechanism tests offer guidance in predicting where the anticompetitive effects of non-horizontal mergers are likely to be strongest.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Parenting and Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a large, randomized cash transfer on parental behaviors, investment in children, children's social, behavioral, and educational outcomes, and pregnancy and childbearing. We find that parents who were randomly selected to receive a $1,000 per month unconditional cash transfer for three years spent more on their children each month and reported better parenting behaviors (such as supervising their children more closely) compared to those randomized to receive $50 per month over the same period. However, possibly due to this closer monitoring, parents in the treatment group also reported that their child was experiencing more developmental difficulties and stress. Parents with the lowest incomes at baseline experienced the largest improvements in parenting; among these parents, the transfer also increased the use and quality of non-parental child care. The transfer did not have a meaningful effect on most educational outcomes measured in school administrative records, nor did it affect characteristics of the home environment, child food security, exposure to homelessness, or parental satisfaction. Although treated families were more likely to move, we did not detect changes in most measures of neighborhood quality, though proximity to child-focused amenities such as daycares appeared to increase in the treatment group relative to the control group. The transfer did not affect childbearing, pregnancy, or outcomes related to contraception. While the transfer reduced parents' stress and mental distress in the first year of the program, these effects were short-lived and dissipated by the second year of the transfer, analogous to what was documented previously in the full population of participants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An interconnected world increases economic efficiency while giving certain countries leverage over others. We aim to describe and understand international power stemming from trade. Using an illustrative model of trade with possibilities of bilateral disputes and ex-post hold-ups, we highlight that bilateral asymmetry in import dependence can be a source of coercive power towards one another. We construct the model-implied measure of international power—asymmetric bilateral import dependence, weighted inversely by sectoral trade elasticities — across country pairs over the past 20 years. Combining this measure with comprehensive data on bilateral engagement events and a high-frequency measure of bilateral geopolitical relationships, we examine the consequences and strategic causes of international power. We show two main empirical results. First, increases in international power between countries — which raise the credibility of threats of trade disruptions — induce more bilateral engagement and negotiations. Second, worsened geopolitical relationships — in anticipation of future disputes — prompt countries to build up greater international power through adjusting trade activities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Renewable electricity generation technology costs have fallen dramatically, investment has grown rapidly, and renewables are now a pillar of climate and decarbonization policy. Part of the credit for these trends goes to environmental policy efforts to support renewable energy as a substitute to fossil energy. The recent rise in protectionism, industrial policy, and geopolitical tensions has the potential to either undermine or enhance these environmental policy objectives. In this paper, we provide an overview of renewable energy economics and policy, with a focus on solar and wind power. We outline theoretical rationales for industrial policy and review recent empirical research, paying particular attention to how renewable energy policies have generated spillovers across firms and countries. We close by highlighting how this recent evidence can inform ongoing industrial policy debates.</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Coercion with Faster Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a model in which one firm uses a pricing algorithm that enables faster pricing and multi-period commitment. We characterize a coercive equilibrium in which the algorithmic firm maximizes its profits subject to the incentive compatibility constraint of its rival. By adopting an algorithm that enables faster pricing and (imperfect) commitment, a firm can unilaterally induce substantially higher equilibrium prices even when its rival maximizes short-run profits and cannot collude. The algorithmic firm can earn profits that exceed its share of collusive profits, and coercive equilibrium outcomes can be worse for consumers than collusive outcomes. We use simulations to show how coercion arises rapidly when the algorithmic firm’s rival uses a simple learning process to set prices. Finally, we examine the implications of algorithm technology for platform design.</content>

    <title>Can Author Manipulation of AI Referees be Welfare Improving?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a new moral hazard in delegated decision-making: authors can embed hidden instructions—known as prompt injections—to bias AI referees in academic peer review, thereby hijacking machine recommendations. Because AI reviews are relatively inexpensive compared to manual assessments, referees would otherwise delegate fully, which undermines quality. The paper shows that moderate detection of manipulation can paradoxically improve welfare. With intermediate detection probabilities, only low-quality authors undertake manipulation, and detection becomes informative about quality, inducing referees to mix between manual and AI reviews. This partially separating equilibrium preserves the value of peer review when AI quality is intermediate. When detection is too low, all bad papers are manipulated and the market unravels; when detection is perfect, referees use only AI and acceptance collapses. Thus, some prompt injection must be tolerated to sustain the market: it disciplines referees and generates information. The results caution against zero-tolerance enforcement and highlight how prompt injection can, counterintuitively, play a welfare-enhancing role when AI reviews are easily produced.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assemble global, spatially disaggregated panel data on ambient particulates, population, and economic activity, and develop a macroeconomic integrated assessment model of particulate exposure for 30 countries representing 60\% of world population. The data indicate the importance of country level factors in determining particulate exposure. Model results indicate the importance of equilibrium adjustments. For example, uncompensated oil taxes and agricultural burning restrictions may unintentionally raise exposure by shifting labor to dirtier sectors or locations. Model results also showcase the importance of country heterogeneity and fiscal management. Our results suggest that effective particulates policy requires accounting for general equilibrium responses.</content>

    <title>Carbon Taxes and Green Subsidies in a World Economy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine positive and normative questions that arise with the joint use of carbon taxes and green subsidies in an open economy. Moving from autarky to free trade induces countries to introduce green subsidies and reduce carbon taxes, in order to reduce foreign emissions. In contrast to the “leakage” effect of carbon taxes, green subsidies are associated with “reverse leakage,” as they decrease emissions both at home and abroad, and as a consequence, the availability of green subsidies tends to be good for global welfare. International climate agreements (ICAs) seek to increase carbon taxes, but the effect on green subsidies is more nuanced. An ICA removes green subsidies, even though they exert positive international externalities at the noncooperative equilibrium. If, however, policies can only be changed gradually, an ICA may start by increasing subsidies before decreasing them over time. We also consider the welfare implications of lobbying from the fossil and green energy sectors. In a noncooperative setting, we find that pressures from the fossil lobby tend to reduce welfare, whereas pressures from the green lobby tend to increase welfare. We also find that in the presence of lobbying, an ICA can decrease welfare relative to the noncooperative equilibrium, even if it changes carbon taxes and green subsidies toward their efficient levels.</content>

    <title>"Muddling Through or Tunnelling Through?” UK Monetary and Fiscal Exceptionalism and the Great Inflation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discussion of the causes of the Great Inflation in the UK during the 1970s has centred around the relative importance of two potential explanations, which we label “bad luck” – the occurrence of unusually large commodity price and supply-side shocks - and “bad policy” reflecting failures in both monetary and prices and incomes policies. By reconsidering the historical and empirical record of inflation from 1950s to the early 1990s we show that the persistence of the Great Inflation in the UK cannot fully be explained by these factors, although these can account for some of the major fluctuations. Instead, underlying inflation and inflation expectations appear to be the result of a sequence of regime shifts. We argue those regime shifts are as much related to fundamental changes in fiscal policy as they are to monetary policy and union reforms. Our empirical evidence suggests that fiscal policy was at the heart of many of the problems in the UK during the Great Inflation. In contrast to most of British history, it was not used to stabilise the public finances. Instead, it was used to keep unemployment down and growth up, to subsidise losers from terms of trade shocks and to secure deals with the unions.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Child with Down Syndrome</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the causal impact of having a child with Down syndrome relative to having one without Down syndrome using event studies around birth and population-wide Swedish administrative data from 1990 to 2019. The incremental effect of having a child with Down syndrome is to increase the likelihood of parental co-habitation and subsequent child-bearing. These effects exist both in an environment with essentially no prenatal testing – where the birth of a child with Down syndrome is random conditional on maternal age – as well as once prenatal screening and testing is more common. In both contexts, total income also increases due to the presence of a generous allowance for families with a child with a disability, but the impact on labor earnings differs. In the “no-testing” environment, having a child with Down syndrome leads to a greater decrease in maternal earnings post-birth relative to having a child without Down syndrome, but this effect reverses sign once testing is available. Our results speak to the impact on families of a child with Down syndrome in a setting where families are largely insured against any additional financial costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between the early 1990s and 2015 the relationship between mental despair and age was hump-shaped in the United States: it rose to middle-age, then declined later in life.  That relationship has now changed: mental despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among the young.  However, the relationship between age and mental despair differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for those who are unable to work and the unemployed.  The relation between mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for homemakers, students and the retired.  The change in the age-despair profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers.  Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers. We find broad-based evidence for this finding in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of 1993-2023, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2008-2023, and in surveys by Pew, the Conference Board and Johns Hopkins University.</content>

    <title>What Does Consulting Do?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first systematic and comprehensive empirical study of management and strategy consulting. We unveil the workings of this opaque industry by drawing on universal administrative business-to-business transaction data based on value-added tax links from Belgium (2002-2023). These data permit us to document the nature of consulting engagements, take-up patterns, and the effects on client firms. We document that consulting take-up is concentrated among large, high-labor-productivity firms. For TFP and profitability, we find a U-shaped pattern: both high and low performers hire consultants. New clients spend on average 3% of payroll on consulting, typically in episodic engagements lasting less than one year. Using difference-in-differences designs exploiting these sharp consulting events, we find positive effects on labor productivity of 3.6% over five years, driven by modest employment reductions alongside stable or growing revenue. Average wages rise by 2.7% with no decline in labor’s share of value added, suggesting productivity gains do not come at workers’ expense through rent-shifting. We do observe organizational restructuring with small increases in dismissal rates, and higher services procurement but reduced labor outsourcing. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals larger productivity gains for initially less productive firms, suggesting improvements in allocative efficiency. Our findings broadly align with ex-ante predictions from surveyed academic economists and consulting professionals, validating the productivity-enhancing view of consulting endorsed by most practitioners though only half of academics, while lending less support to a rent-shifting view favored by many economists.</content>

    <title>Understanding Cultural Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Culture’s influence on economic outcomes is no longer controversial among economists even if it remains largely ignored in many areas of economics.  This paper tackles a different question:  why does culture change?  The underlying premise adopted here is that culture changes because incentives change, transforming actions and beliefs. An idiosyncratic review of the literature follows that illustrates how the environment (e.g., the prevalence of pathogens or the suitability of land for pastoralism) and historical experiences (e.g., colonization, war, or migration) can affect relationships of power in society and shape people’s beliefs.  It then examines the role of new information and ideas (i.e., learning) and finally the role of policies in shaping incentives and changing culture.  A second part of the paper reviews work that models the mechanisms of cultural change more explicitly, using quantitative models to examine the interplay between economic incentives and evolving beliefs or preferences and to study the importance of intermediating mechanisms.  Given that one of the most profound cultural and economic transformations of the past 150 years concerns gender roles, this theme recurs throughout.</content>

    <title>Opting Out of Centralized Collective Bargaining: Evidence from Italy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents micro-empirical evidence on the effects of wage-setting decentralization. Our setting is Italy, where employers are required to comply with occupation- and industry-specific wage floors set by national collective bargaining agreements. We show that opting out of these agreements reduces wages but increases workers’ employment and retention within firms. These effects are most pronounced in the more productive North, where the overall impact on workers’ earnings is slightly positive. In contrast, in the South, wage losses outweigh employment gains, leading to a net decline in earnings. We also find that increased wage-setting flexibility is associated with higher firm survival rates in both regions. The regional divergence in outcomes aligns with a monopsony framework in which productivity and labor supply elasticities vary spatially.</content>

    <title>The Time Cost of a Disability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider how a physical disability alters patterns of time use. A disability may raise the time cost of all activities; of some—making them differentially less worth doing; or it may make switching activities more costly. The first yields no predictions about time use, but the latter two possibilities both predict that fewer activities will be undertaken, with more time spent on each. These explanations describe our findings based on non-working ATUS 2008-22 respondents ages 70+, 32 percent of whom self-assess a disability. Data from the Polish Time Use Survey, where disability is medically certified, show similar results; and they demonstrate the same loss of variety over multiple days. Remarkably similar basic results are found using homogenized British, Canadian, French, Spanish, and Italian time-diaries. Overall, a mobility/physical disability leads an otherwise identical person to engage in over 10 percent fewer activities on a typical day. The lost variety represents extra costs equivalent in data from six countries to over twice the average annual income among older individuals in the country.</content>

    <title>Multinational Firms and Cross-Border Mergers: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multinational firms play a pivotal role in the global economy, yet economic and finance research has largely examined them in isolation.  Economic theory focuses on trade and multinational activity but gives relatively little attention to cross-border mergers, while finance research emphasizes empirical studies of mergers but rarely integrates broader economic theories. This chapter aims to synthesize these two literatures into a unified framework for understanding multinational firms and cross-border mergers.  The discussion is organized around the decision-making process of multinational firms, from choosing to operate internationally to selecting between greenfield investment and mergers.  This framework reveals the theoretical and empirical evidence on the drivers of multinational production,  including productivity gains, knowledge transfers, and market frictions. The findings highlight the commonality between the two literatures, but also suggests that greater integration between economic theory and finance research will generate a deeper understanding of the role of multinational firms in the global economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of the Digital Economy has the potential to reshape international financial markets and the role of traditional reserve assets such as the US dollar. While the creation of Stablecoins may increase the demand for safe dollar-denominated instruments due to reserve backing requirements, they may also serve as substitutes, reducing the global demand for traditional reserve assets. We develop a multicountry model featuring the US, the rest of the world, and a distinct Digital Economy to quantify the impact of the potential expansion of the digital economy. Our results show that, in the long run, the reserve demand effect dominates the substitution effect, leading to lower US interest rates and greater US foreign borrowing. We also find that the expansion of the Digital Economy increases idiosyncratic consumption volatility in the US, while reducing it in the rest of the world.</content>

    <title>Flexible Data Centers and the Grid: Lower Costs, Higher Emissions?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Data centers are among the fastest-growing electricity consumers, raising concerns about their impact on grid operations and decarbonization goals. Their temporal flexibility—the ability to shift workloads over time—offers a source of demand-side flexibility. We model power systems in three U.S. regions: Mid-Atlantic, Texas, and WECC, under varying flexibility levels. We evaluate flexibility's effects on grid operations, investment, system costs, and emissions. Across all scenarios, flexible data centers reduce costs by shifting load from peak to off-peak hours, flattening net demand, and supporting renewable and baseload resources. This load shifting facilitates renewable integration while improving the utilization of existing baseload capacity. As a result, the emissions impact depends on which effect dominates. Higher renewable penetration increases the emissions-reduction potential of data center flexibility, while lower shares favor baseload generation and may raise emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning data center flexibility with renewable deployment and regional conditions.</content>

    <title>Unpacking Aggregate Welfare in a Spatial Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do regional productivity shocks or transportation infrastructure improvements affect aggregate welfare? In a general class of spatial equilibrium models, we provide a formula for aggregate welfare changes, decomposed into terms associated with (i) technology (Fogel 1964, Hulten 1978), (ii) spatial dispersion of marginal utility, (iii) fiscal externalities, (iv) technological externalities, and (v) redistribution. We further use this decomposition to derive a general formula for optimal spatial transfers and show that, whenever optimal transfers are in place, the technology term alone captures the aggregate welfare effects of technological shocks. We apply our framework to study welfare gains from improving the US highway network. We find that changes in the spatial dispersion of marginal utility are as important as technological externalities in accounting for the deviations from the Fogel-Hulten benchmark to assess welfare gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A central challenge in the climate crisis is how to mobilize collective action—and who can do it. We show that digital platforms can transform latent support for sustainability into measurable environmental outcomes, while also generating value for the platform itself. We study Ant Forest, a program embedded in Alipay, China’s leading fintech app, which rewards users’ low-carbon behaviors with game points redeemable for planting real trees in arid regions of the country. Since its launch in 2016, the program has engaged over 700 million users and funded the planting of 500 million trees. Using user-level data, we find that participation is significantly higher in cities that have experienced faster vegetation growth. We propose a “green experience” mechanism: visible environmental improvement fosters greater appreciation for nature and increases support for sustainability efforts elsewhere. Survey evidence supports this mechanism, with participants also citing gamification and warm glow as key motivators. We further document spillover effects: Ant Forest participation boosts donations to external environmental projects and increases overall use of the Alipay app. These findings highlight the potential of digital platforms to scale climate action while creating shared environmental and economic value.</content>

    <title>The Risk, Reward, and Asset Allocation of Nonprofit Endowment Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using tax filings from 374,351 U.S. nonprofit organizations from 2008 to 2020, we provide the first large-scale analysis of endowment prevalence, function, asset allocation, and returns. Endowment use varies systematically across sectors and revenue models. Organizations with endowments scale mission-related spending more effectively and hedge revenue risk through asset allocation. Yet most endowments underperform passive benchmarks, with the weakest performance concentrated among smaller, self-managed funds. Advisory fees are positively correlated with gross returns but negatively with net returns, suggesting overpayment for investment services. Stronger governance, lower discretionary spending, and the use of outsourced CIOs are associated with better performance.</content>

    <title>Rural-Urban Migration and Market Integration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine a new collection of microdata from China with a natural policy experiment to investigate the extent to which reductions in rural-urban migration barriers affect flows of trade and investments between cities and the countryside. We find that increases in worker eligibility for urban residence registration (Hukou) across origin-destination pairs increase rural-urban exports, imports, capital inflows and outflows, both in terms of bilateral transaction values and the number of unique buyer-seller matches. To quantify the implications at the regional level, we interpret these estimates through the lens of a spatial equilibrium model in which migrants can reduce buyer-seller matching frictions. We find that a 10% increase in a rural county's migration market access on average leads to a 1.5% increase in the county's trade market access and a 2% increase in investment market access. In the context of China's recent Hukou reforms, we find that these knock-on effects on market integration were on average larger among the urban destinations compared to the rural origins, reinforcing incentives for rural-urban migration.</content>

    <title>The Undoing of Economic Sanctions: Evidence from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of Ukraine’s economic blockade of the anthracite-rich Donbas region, to demonstrate how trade sanctions’ efficacy can be undermined by trade through non-participatory nations. We document that after the blockade was imposed in March 2017, Russia reported a sharp increase in anthracite imports from Ukraine, while Ukraine reported no exports to Russia at all. We interpret this gap in “mirror statistics” as reflecting a shift in Donbas trade through Russia. Concurrently, Ukraine anthracite imports from Russia increased sharply (from near-zero), indicating that some of the increased supply of anthracite in Russia was exported back to Ukraine. We provide suggestive evidence that Russian traders benefited from monopsony rents, buying low-priced anthracite from Donbas while Russia sold anthracite to Ukraine at prices comparable to other export markets. Overall, our findings highlight some of the economic and geographic features that may raise the cost and limit the efficacy of sanctions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies of income and regime type typically contrast democracies and autocracies, ignoring heterogeneity in the character of authoritarian regimes. We focus on the consequences of personalist rule, where power is concentrated in an individual or small elite. Extending the dynamic panel strategy of Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2019), we estimate the differential growth performance of democracies, institutionalized autocracies, and personalist autocracies. Across eight GDP series, eight autocracy codings, and six measures of personalism, we observe a consistent pattern: Whenever an "autocratic penalty" emerges, it is concentrated in personalist regimes. The growth performance of institutionalized dictatorships, in contrast, is statistically indistinguishable from that of democracies. We document evidence that the "personalist penalty" is driven by some combination of low private investment, poor public-goods provision, and conflict. These findings emphasize the analytic payoff of unpacking autocracy and highlight the different incentives facing leaders with narrow and broad bases of power.</content>

    <title>Attitudes to Debt: The Role of Moral Values</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper tests how people’s moral values influence their views of debt contracts. We ask participants to make decisions about debt contracts in different hypothetical situations (vignettes). We separately measure their moral values using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham et al., 2009). We have three main sets of findings. First, differences in moral values strongly explain the cross-section of participants’ debt decisions. Participants with more conservative values show more support for credit score-based loan pricing, stricter forms of collateral, and tougher bankruptcy resolution. Second, when we randomly change the economic costs and benefits of debt within our vignettes, we find that participants change their answers in the direction predicted by economic theory. Third, participants’ beliefs of the functioning of the credit market strongly correlate with their moral values. Participants with conservative values are more likely to believe that strict enforcement and risk-based loan pricing provide incentives and are economically efficient. More liberal participants believe that insurance against unlucky shocks are important. Consistent with moral values being distinct from Bayesian beliefs, financial literacy does not attenuate moral values in shaping beliefs about what is economically efficient.</content>

    <title>Optimal School System and Curriculum Design: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a model of education production and uses it to study optimal school system and curriculum design. Curriculum design is modeled as a time-allocation problem. A school teaches students many skills and allocates time to different skills based on student characteristics.  Our framework provides a novel interpretation of studies that find zero achievement effects at selective school admission cutoffs. We show that such findings may be consistent with highly effective schools implementing optimal curricula, rather than necessarily indicating ineffective schools. The interpretation depends on the alignment between measured outcome skills and skills emphasized in the curriculum. We test several model predictions using data from a prominent exam school and find supporting evidence that would be difficult to rationalize if selective schools were ineffective.</content>

    <title>Strategic Complexity Promotes Egalitarianism in Legislative Bargaining</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic models of legislative bargaining predict that proposers can extract high shares of economic surplus by identifying and exploiting weak coalition partners. However, strength and weakness can be difficult to assess even with relatively simple bargaining protocols. We evaluate experimentally how strategic complexity affects the ability to identify weak coalition partners, and for the partners themselves to determine whether their positions are weak or strong. We find that, as strategic complexity progressively obscures bargaining strength, proposers migrate to egalitarianism, in significant part because non-proposers begin placing substantial weight on fairness. Greater analytic skill dampens but does not eliminate these patterns.</content>

    <title>New Economic Forces Behind the Value Distribution of Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in a general-purpose technology (GPT) enable many firms to invent complementary inventions, or co-inventions, making the GPT more valuable. This study examines the empirical implications of a straightforward model in which firms choose either incremental or novel co-invention.  Incremental co-inventors aspire to small gains at low costs and with less uncertainty. Novel co-inventors introduce new products or services with the potential for large returns, but do so at high costs and with uncertain outcomes. Similar firms investing in incremental co-invention will create value proportional to their existing business, a benchmark we illustrate with the experiences at local radio and newspapers. The study then examines the value of co-inventions for the World Wide Web and mobile ecosystems, focusing on success in 2013, using data from many sources. This data supports analysis comparing the incremental and novel regimes. The latter should display a distinctly different upper tail of the distribution of returns. We show that the value distributions for incremental and novel co-invention are far apart.  Incremental co-invention is more widely distributed across regions, industries, and firms. Success from novel co-invention is rare, challenging, and the source of the largest value. In the aggregate, novel co-invention creates the most value, so the overall value distribution remains concentrated in a few industries, regions, and firms.</content>

    <title>An Informational Nudge to Shave Peak Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Informational nudges to encourage energy conservation or load shifting have been tried in various contexts. This paper studies a program run by a small municipally owned electric utility to reduce demand on certain peak demand days. An email alert is sent out to residential customers who sign up for the alerts. Some recipients of those alerts forward the alerts to other customers or community groups, making it difficult to determine how broadly the alerts are disseminated. The alerts encourage load shifting and energy saving during specific hours on the following day.
Using hourly load data for the utility, I estimate the reduction in electricity load caused by the alert emails. Using an instrumental variables approach, estimates suggest that load is reduced by roughly 0.7 MWs per hour during the hours covered by the alert. This works out to a reduction in load on the order of 2 percent. I calculate the cost savings to the municipal utility and discuss social and private benefits of the program. The private benefits of the peak alert program swamp the social benefits.</content>

    <title>The Causal Effect of News on Inflation Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the response of household inflation expectations to television news coverage of inflation.  We analyze news data from CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC alongside a daily measure of inflation expectations. Using a local projection instrumental variables approach, we estimate the dynamic causal effect of inflation news coverage on household inflation expectations at a daily frequency. Increased media coverage of inflation raises expectations, with effects peaking within a few days and fading after approximately 10 days. Additionally, we document a key nonlinearity: release days with positive CPI surprises—i.e., inflation exceeding market expectations—lead to stronger expectation responses than release days with negative surprises.</content>

    <title>Campaigning for Extinction: Eradication of Sparrows and the Great Famine in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do large disruptions to ecosystems affect human well-being? This paper tests the long-standing hypothesis that China's 1958 Four Pests Campaign, which exterminated sparrows despite scientists’ warnings about their pest-control role, exacerbated the Great Famine—the largest in human history. Combining newly digitized data on historical agricultural productivity in China with habitat suitability modeling methods in ecology, we find that, after sparrow eradication, a one-standard-deviation increase in sparrow suitability led to 5.3% larger rice and 8.7% larger wheat declines. State food procurement exacerbated these losses, resulting in a 9.6% higher mortality in high-suitability counties—implying nearly two million excess deaths.</content>

    <title>Retail Investors’ Contrarian Behavior Around News, Attention, and the Momentum Effect</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large and representative panel of U.S. brokerage accounts, we show that retail investors trade as contrarians after large earnings surprises, especially for loser stocks, and that such contrarian trading contributes to price momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD).  We show that extreme return streaks and surprises are not enough for stocks to exhibit PEAD and momentum and that the intensity of contrarian retail trading plays a key role: the PEAD of loser stocks with bad earnings surprises becomes increasingly more negative as retail buying pressure increases, and he PEAD of the stocks with the highest past returns and largest earnings surprises is the most positive for the stocks with the biggest net retail outflow. Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. Younger and more attentive individuals are more likely to be contrarian, and a firm’s dividend yield, leverage, size, book to market, and analyst coverage are associated with the fraction of contrarian trades they face around earnings announcements.  The disposition effect and stale limit orders, while present in our sample, do not explain our results. Our findings are consistent with investors’ conservatism, sticky beliefs, and cognitive uncertainty, as well as an incorrect belief in the Law of Small Numbers.</content>

    <title>Entrepreneurial Experimentation Design for Venture Finance</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how entrepreneurs strategically design experiments to convince venture capitalists (VCs) to fund their projects when investors interpret data through heterogeneous statistical frameworks. Drawing on Liang (2021)'s model of games with incomplete information played by statistical learners, we translate her abstract theoretical framework into a practical venture capital setting. We characterise how entrepreneurs balance funding plausibility against equity dilution by strategically choosing experiments along two critical dimensions: sample size (precision) and dimensionality (breadth of metrics). Our analysis reveals that for genuinely high-quality projects, increased precision helps by forcing VC beliefs to converge toward true quality. For low-quality projects, funding depends on preserving disagreement through sparse, high-dimensional experiments. The entrepreneur's optimal design depends critically on their prior beliefs: confident entrepreneurs choose high-precision, low-dimensional experiments that minimise equity dilution, while uncertain entrepreneurs opt for sparse, high-dimensional experiments that maximise the probability some VC will hold sufficiently optimistic beliefs. The framework provides a rigorous foundation for understanding how entrepreneurs and investors can rationally disagree when observing identical evidence, with significant implications for strategic information design in entrepreneurial settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop novel high-frequency indices that measure climate attention across a wide range of developed and emerging economies. By analyzing the text of over 23 million Tweets published by leading national newspapers, we find that a country experiencing more severe climate news shocks tends to see both an inflow of capital and an appreciation of its currency. In addition, brown stocks experience large and persistent negative returns after a global climate news shock if located in highly exposed countries. A risk-sharing model in which investors price climate news shocks and trade consumption and investment goods in global markets rationalizes these findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How beneficial are transport infrastructure investments and other transport policies? This chapter develops a framework whose goal is to survey and synthesize the answers that regional and urban economists have given to this question. Emphasis is placed on theoretical results about sufficient statistics that capture approximate impacts in both distorted and undistorted economies, as well as how new advances in data collection and causal inference are poised to leverage these theoretical results and thereby modernize and extend standard templates for infrastructure and policy evaluation. The chapter concludes with discussions of optimal policy, political economy, and practical matters of infrastructure provision.</content>

    <title>Feeling Rich or Looking Rich? Quantifying Self-Image and Social-Image Motives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Preferences for status are typically attributed to two distinct channels: self-image, in which individuals derive utility from being richer than others, and social-image, in which individuals value being seen as richer by others. While both channels are believed to be at play, little is known about their relative importance. We address this gap using a hypothetical discrete choice experiment. Our findings indicate that self-image is at most 19.3% as important as social-image. Additionally, we document substantial heterogeneity in the strength of these preferences across individuals and domains.</content>

    <title>Reskilling and Resilience</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that effective reskilling can have profound mental health benefits for workers and their partners. Using institutional variation in access to higher education after work accidents in Denmark, we find that reskilling prevents one case of depression for every three injured workers. Strikingly, the spillover effects on partners are just as large. These mental health gains are accompanied by higher partner employment and increased separation rates, suggesting that reskilling frees partners from costly relationship commitments. Together, the mental health and partner benefits add 83% to the direct labor earnings gains from reskilling.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Global Supply Chains: An Integrated Framework That Incorporates Foreign Invested Firms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new unified accounting framework to measure Global Supply Chain (GSC) activities. It integrates decomposition frameworks on gross output, trade, and value added, and formally incorporates the role of Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs). Compared to the existing Global Value Chain (GVC) metrics that do not distinguish FIEs from domestic firms, the estimate of GSC activities in our approach is three times as large. The key contributions of our approach are: (1) distinguishing GSC activities based on their positions along production chains (upstream, downstream, or both) and mode of engagement (trade, FDI, or both); (2) extending Vertical Specialization (VS) measures to domestic supply chains, bridging trade-only and production-based analyses; and (3) reconciling net and gross decompositions to provide a comprehensive view of GSC participation and exposures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I describe nine implications of the interconnectedness of fiscal and monetary policy that surface in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models. Not all are unique to HANK models. (i) Long run fiscal changes force monetary adjustments. (ii) Sustainable permanent deficits are feasible. (iii) Monetary policy leaves fiscal footprints, even with passive fiscal policy. (iv) Fewer controversies around active fiscal policy. (v) Equilibria are unique under a wider class of fiscal and monetary rules. (vi) With short-term debt, raising nominal rates without a fiscal contraction raises inflation. (vii) Unfunded fiscal stimulus is more inflationary. (viii) Even fully funded fiscal stimulus is inflationary. (ix) Fiscal transfers can substitute for monetary policy in the aggregate.</content>

    <title>Misperceptions About Air Pollution: Implications for Willingness to Pay and Environmental Inequality</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Matthew A. Tarduno &amp; Reed Walker</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether misperceptions about air pollution contribute to environmental inequality in the United States. We use a two-part survey experiment to elicit respondents' beliefs about local air quality and pollution's effects on life expectancy. We document how misperception differs across demographic groups and then how this misperception affects willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. Since misperception or beliefs may be correlated with other unobservable determinants of WTP, we randomly show selected participants customized information about their actual air pollution. This allows us to trace out how experimentally induced changes in beliefs affect WTP for air quality. Our results suggest significant misperceptions about air pollution in the US. Respondents, on average, overestimate both their air pollution exposure and its impact on life expectancy. Beliefs about relative air pollution are not systematically biased but are noisy. Despite some differences in misperceptions between Black and White respondents, counterfactual exercises do not suggest that rectifying these misperceptions would meaningfully close the observed gap in WTP and/or pollution exposure.</content>

    <title>Fear and Risk Perception: Understanding Physicians' Dynamic Responses to Malpractice Lawsuits</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Hanming Fang, Ming Li &amp; Jia Xiang</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how physicians adjust their clinical decision-making following medical malpractice lawsuits and how these responses are driven by mental rather than ﬁnancial costs, and do not align with rational expectations. We combine a comprehensive health insurance claim database from a Chinese city with the universe of malpractice lawsuits to study changes in physician behavior and patient outcomes. We ﬁnd that physicians respond to lawsuits by practicing more conservatively, rejecting high-risk patients, reducing surgery rates, and increasing the use of diagnostic tests and traditional Chinese medicine. These changes are associated with worse patient outcomes, consistent with defensive medicine. The eﬀects are not limited to the directly involved departments but spill over to other departments within the same hospital. In addition, the changes are short-lived, with physicians reverting to their pre-lawsuit treatment patterns in eight weeks. We provide evidence that such responses are likely driven by mental cost (including fear) and deviate from rational expectations. First, physicians in hospitals with more and less frequent lawsuits exhibit similar responses to a new lawsuit; moreover, they respond similarly to winning and losing cases. Second, physicians’ reactions to a patient’s death vary depending on the recency of a salient lawsuit. Lastly, physician responses are especially strong following criminal violence against physicians, which is emotionally and psychologically salient.</content>

    <title>Concentration and Markups in International Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper derives a closed-form expression linking aggregate markups on imported inputs to concentration in a model of firm-to-firm trade with two-sided market power. Our theory extends standard oligopoly insights in two dimensions. First, it reveals that markups increase with exporter concentration and decrease with importer concentration, reflecting the balance of oligopoly and oligopsony forces. Second, it adapts conventional market definitions to reflect rigid trading relationships, yielding new concentration measures that capture competition in firm-to-firm trade. Analysis of Colombian transaction-level import data shows these differences are key to understanding markup dynamics in international trade.</content>

    <title>Random Walk Forecasts of Stationary Processes Have Low Bias</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the use of a misspecified overdifferenced model to forecast the level of a stationary scalar time series. Let x(t) be the series, and let bias be the sample average of a series of forecast errors. Then, the bias of forecasts of x(t) generated by a misspecified overdifferenced ARMA model for Δx(t) will tend to be smaller in magnitude than the bias of forecasts of x(t) generated by a correctly specified model for x(t). Formally, let P be the number of forecasts. The bias from the model for Δx(t) has a variance that is O(1/P^2), while the variance of the bias from the model for x(t) generally is O(1/P). With a driftless random walk as our baseline overdifferenced model, we confirm this theoretical result with simulations and empirical work: random walk bias is generally one-tenth to one-half that of an appropriately specified model fit to levels.</content>

    <title>Market Rents and CPI Shelter Inflation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research finds that the shelter component of CPI inflation responds with a lag to movements in market rents—the rents that tenants pay when they move into a new dwelling. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of this fact. We start by identifying three sources of lags between market rents and CPI shelter: the rents of most tenants are set in long-term leases; rents are smoothed for continuing tenants who renew leases; and CPI shelter inflation is measured with rent changes over six months. We incorporate these lags in a model of shelter inflation and compare the model to monthly data since 2015, using the Zillow Observed Rent Index to measure market rents. We find that the model performs fairly well, suggesting that it may be useful for understanding and forecasting inflation.</content>

    <title>Do Environmental Markets Improve Allocative Efficiency? Evidence from U.S. Air Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The central appeal of environmental markets – efficient allocation of emission reductions – has been difficult to establish empirically. We develop a framework linking the theoretical change in allocative efficiency following a market-based policy to a quasi-experimental estimator. We apply this framework with administrative data to two major U.S. air pollution markets. We find allocative efficiency for pollution improved by 3.3 percentage points annually under California’s RECLAIM program but do not detect a change under the U.S.’ NOx Budget Trading Program. These results are supported by greater heterogeneity in baseline facility characteristics under RECLAIM and differences in program implementation.</content>

    <title>Markups and Cost Pass-through Along the Supply Chain</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a novel dataset of production costs, wholesale prices, and retail prices from a large global manufacturer to study markups and pricing behavior along the supply chain. We document several facts about markups covering the period July 2018 through June 2023, and we propose a model of supply chain pricing behavior that rationalizes key pat-terns in our data. We find substantial dispersion in markups across products at each supply chain level. Manufacturer and retail markups are negatively correlated in the cross section and over time. Despite time-series variation in firm-level markups, total markups—reflecting the relationship between retail prices and production costs—are stable over time, even when prices increased along with inflation in the United States in 2022. We apply our model to quantify factors that determine relative bargaining power between the manufacturer and retailers, leveraging variation across countries, products, and time. Finally, we consider the dynamics of cost pass-through and the mediating role of manufacturer-retailer bargaining in price dynamics, with implications for current policy debates, including trade policy and tariffs.</content>

    <title>The Social Lifecycle Impacts of Power Plant Siting in the Historical United States</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relative contributions of siting decisions and post-siting demo-graphic shifts to current disparities in exposure to polluting fossil-fuel plants in the United States. Our analysis leverages newly digitized data on power plant siting and operations from 1900-2020, combined with spatially resolved demographics and population data from the U.S Census from 1870-2020. We find little evidence that fossil-fuel plants were disproportionately sited in counties with higher Black population shares on average. However, event study estimates indicate that Black population share grows in the decades after the first fossil-fuel plant is built in a county, with average increases in Black population share of 4 percentage points in the 50-70 years after first siting. These long-run demographic shifts are driven by counties that first hosted a fossil-fuel plant between 1900-1949. We close by exploring how these long-run demographic shifts were shaped by the Great Migration, differential sorting in response to pollution, and other factors. Our findings highlight that the equity implications of siting long-lived infrastructure can differ dramatically depending on the time span considered.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As geopolitical tensions intensify, great powers often turn to trade policy to influence international alignment. We examine the optimal design of tariffs in a world where large countries care not only about economic welfare but also about the political allegiance of smaller states. We consider both a unipolar setting, where a single hegemon uses preferential trade agreements to attract partners, and a bipolar world, where two great powers compete for influence. In both scenarios, we derive optimal tariffs that balance terms-of-trade considerations with strategic incentives to encourage political alignment. We find that when geopolitical concerns are active, the optimal tariff exceeds the classic Mill-Bickerdike level. In a bipolar world, optimal tariffs reflect both economic and political rivalry, and may be strategic complements or substitutes. A calibration exercise using U.N. voting patterns, an estimate of the cost of buying votes in the U.N., and military spending suggests that geopolitical motives can significantly amplify protectionist pressures and that the emergence of a second great power can contribute to a retreat from globalization.</content>

    <title>The Legacy of High Inflation on Monetary Policy Rules</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows the key, yet overlooked, role played by the legacy of a high inflation history on the strength of the monetary policy response to inflationary shocks. To rationalize this, we propose a New Keynesian model that diverges from the existing workhorse model by adding path-dependence (to a forward-looking model) and potentially imperfect central bank credibility. We show that achieving low inflation (hitting the target) requires more aggressive monetary policy reactions, and is costlier from an output point of view, when individuals’ past inflationary experiences shape their inflation expectation formation. In turn, we provide empirical evidence of the need for these two theoretical additions. Countries that experienced a high level of inflation before adopting the IT regime tend to respond more aggressively to deviations of inflation expectations from the central bank’s target. We also point to the existence of a credibility puzzle, whereby the strength of a central bank’s monetary policy response to deviations from the inflation target remains broadly unchanged even as central banks gain credibility over time. Put differently, a country’s inflationary past casts a long and persistent shadow on central banks.</content>

    <title>Are Juries Racially Discriminatory? Evidence from the Race-Blind Charging of Grand Jury Defendants with and without Racially Distinctive Names</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We implement five different tests of whether grand juries, which are drawn from a representative cross-section of the public, discriminate against Black defendants when deciding to prosecute felony cases. Three tests exploit that while jurors do not directly observe defendant race, jurors do observe the “Blackness” of defendants’ names. All three tests—an audit-study-style test, a traditional outcome-based test, and a test that estimates racial bias using blinded/unblinded comparisons after purging omitted variable bias—indicate juries do not discriminate based on race. Two additional tests indicate racial bias explains at most 0.3 percent of the Black-White felony conviction gap.</content>

    <title>Sequential College Admission Mechanisms and Off-Platform Options</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The optimal functioning of centralized allocation systems is undermined by the presence of institutions operating off-platform—a feature common to virtually all real-world implementations. These off-platform options generate justified envy, as students may reject their centralized assignment in favor of an outside offer, leaving vacant seats in programs that others would have preferred to their current match. We examine whether sequential assignment procedures can mitigate this inefficiency: they allow students to delay their enrollment decision to potentially receive a better offer later, at the cost of waiting before knowing their final admission outcome. To quantify this trade-off, we estimate a dynamic model of application and acceptance decisions using rich administrative data from the French college admission system, which include rank-ordered lists and waiting decisions. We find that waiting costs are large. Yet, by improving students’ assignment outcomes relative to a standard single-round system, the sequential mechanism decreases the share of students who leave the higher education system without a degree by 5.4% and leads to large welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Seemingly Virtuous Complexity in Return Prediction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Return prediction with Random Fourier Features (RFF)—a very large number, P , of nonlinear trans-formations of a small number, K, of predictor variables—has become popular recently. Surprisingly, this approach appears to yield a successful out-of-sample stock market index timing strategy even when trained in rolling windows as small as T = 12 months with P in the thousands. However, when P ≫ T , the RFF-based forecast becomes a weighted average of the T training sample returns, with weights determined by the similarity between the predictor vectors in the training data and the current predictor vector. In short training windows, similarity primarily reflects temporal proximity, so the forecast reduces to a recency-weighted average of the T return observations in the training data—essentially a momentum strategy. Moreover, because similarity declines with predictor volatility, the result is a volatility-timed momentum strategy. The strong performance of the RFF-based strategy thus stems not from its ability to extract predictive signals from the training data, but from the fact that a volatility-timed momentum strategy happened to perform well in historical data. This point becomes clear when applying the same method to artificial data in which returns exhibit reversals rather than momentum: the RFF approach still constructs the same volatility-timed momentum strategy, which then performs poorly.</content>

    <title>Turning Points in Inflation: A Structural Breaks Approach with Micro Data</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel methodology for detecting inflation turning points that com-bines high-frequency, disaggregated price data with standard structural break techniques to provide policymakers with more timely and precise signals of inflation dynamics. The methodology consists of three key components: measuring inflation as the slope of the log price index rather than using conventional inflation rates, employing structural break techniques to detect shifts in this slope, and leveraging highly disaggregated price indexes to identify trend breaks at a granular level. We apply this approach to study two critical recent episodes: Argentina’s 2024–2025 disinflation and the inflationary impact of U.S. tariff adjustments in 2025. For Argentina, we detect a broad-based disinflationary turning point in May 2024. For the U.S., we find evidence of a turning point in February 2025, with significant sectoral inflation accelerations despite stable aggregate inflation measures. These applications demonstrate the utility of our approach for enhancing real-time inflation monitoring and policy decision-making.</content>

    <title>Why Did Air Conditioning Adoption Accelerate Faster Than Predicted? Evidence from Mexico</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common theme in the vast literature on climate change is the estimation of models using historical data to make predictions many decades into the future. Although there is a large and growing number of these types of studies, researchers rarely return later to check the accuracy of their predictions. In this paper, we perform such an exercise. In Davis and Gertler (2015), we used household-level microdata from Mexico to predict future air conditioning adoption as a function of income and temperature. Revisiting these predictions with 12 years of additional data, we find that air conditioning in Mexico has accelerated, significantly exceeding our predictions. Neither errors in predicting income growth or rising temperatures, nor migration patterns, nor an overly restrictive model can explain the large prediction gap. Instead, our results point to the failure to account for falling electricity prices and technological changes in air conditioner eﬀiciency as key drivers of the prediction gap.</content>

    <title>GenAI Misinformation, Trust, and News Consumption: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how AI-generated misinformation affects demand for trustworthy news, using data from a field experiment by a major German outlet, Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ). Readers were randomly assigned to a treatment highlighting the challenge of distinguishing real from AI-generated images. The treatment raised concern with misinformation (0.3 s.d.) and reduced trust in news (0.1 s.d.), including SZ. Importantly, it affected post-survey browsing behavior: daily visits to SZ digital content rose by 2.5% in the immediate aftermath of the treatment. Moreover, we find that subscriber retention increased by 1.1% after five months, corresponding to about a one-third drop in attrition rate. Results are consistent with a model where the relative value of trustworthy news sources increases with the prevalence of misinformation, which may thus boost engagement with those sources even while lowering trust in news content.</content>

    <title>When is Less More? Bank Arrangements for Liquidity vs Central Bank Support</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory suggests that in the face of fire sale externalities, banks have incentives to overinvest in order to issue excessive money-like deposit liabilities. The existence of a private market for insurance such as contingent capital can eliminate the overinvestment incentives, leading to efficient outcomes. However, it does not eliminate fire sales. A central bank that can infuse liquidity cheaply may be motivated to intervene in the face of fire sales. If so, it can crowd out the private market and, if liquidity intervention is not priced at higher-than-breakeven rates, induce overinvestment. We examine various forms of public intervention to identify the least distortionary ones. Our analysis helps understand the historical prevalence of private insurance in the era preceding central banks and deposit insurance, their subsequent disappearance, as well as the continuing incidence of banking crises and speculative excesses.</content>
