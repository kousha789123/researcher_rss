    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an RCT with college students in Chennai (N=340), we test how modest financial incentives and personalized feedback affect the uptake and targeting (by symptom severity) of free therapy. Despite 56% of students screening positive for at least mild depression or anxiety, only 3% in the control group took up therapy. A small cash incentive increased appointments by 9 percentage points (p = 0.06) on average without substantially affecting targeting. Personalized feedback and recommendations based on a mental health screening tool significantly improved targeting while keeping overall take-up largely unchanged. Combining these two treatments achieved both higher take-up and improved targeting, by increasing appointments among symptomatic individuals by 21 pp (p &lt; 0.01) without affecting uptake by asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that low-cost incentives coupled with screening information can effectively increase uptake while allocating limited mental health care resources to those with greater need.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study residential segregation and access to public services across 1.5 million urban and rural neighborhoods in India. Muslim and Scheduled Caste segregation in India is high by global standards, and only slightly lower than Black-White segregation in the U.S. Within cities, public facilities and infrastructure are systematically less available in Muslim and Scheduled Caste neighborhoods. Nearly all regressive allocation is across neighborhoods within cities—at the most informal and least studied form of government. These inequalities are not visible in the aggregate data typically used for research and policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a micro-founded monetary model of the world economy to study international currency competition. Our model features "unipolar'' equilibria, with a single dominant international currency, and "multipolar'' equilibria, in which multiple currencies circulate internationally. Long-run equilibria are highly history-dependent and tend towards the emergence of a dominant currency. Governments can compete to internationalize their currencies by offering attractive interest rates on their sovereign debt, but large economies have a natural advantage in ensuring the dominance of their currencies. We calibrate the model to assess the quantitative importance of these mechanisms and study the international monetary system's dynamics under several counterfactual scenarios.</content>

    <title>Early Learning Across Decades: Advances in Measuring Head Start Effectiveness</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Head Start program, launched in 1965 and targeted to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, remains the largest early childhood care and education (ECE) program in the United States and the only one deployed at the federal level. As such, the Head Start literature spans several decades and now allows for synthesis of findings from different contexts, time periods, and research designs. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the rigorous evidence measuring Head Start’s effects on children, their families, and society. The focus is on how (1) the contrast between program and counterfactual conditions, (2) takeup of the program among eligible populations, and (3) treatment–effect heterogeneity inform interpretation and applicability of key findings. The paper presents implications of the evidence for the modern-day Head Start program and an adjacent, policy-relevant research agenda.</content>

    <title>Screen More, Sell Later: Screening and Dynamic Signaling in the Mortgage Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic model of asset origination with unobservable screening effort and signaling of loan quality through delayed sale by extending Vanasco (2017). The theory predicts a positive relationship between screening effort and the strength of the signal. We test this central prediction using U.S. mortgage data, measuring screening effort by mortgage processing time. Consistent with the theory, loans that take longer to process are sold with longer delay and are less likely to default, even though observably riskier loans are processed more slowly. Our calibration reveals that the subprime mortgage market operated in a parameter range with endogenous fragility.</content>

    <title>Field Experiments in the Science of Science: Lessons from Peer Review and the Evaluation of New Knowledge</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scientific evaluation and peer review govern the allocation of resources and certification of knowledge in science, yet have been subjected to limited causal investigation. This chapter synthesizes randomized experiments embedded in live peer-evaluation systems at journals, conferences, and funding agencies, restricting attention to published studies. I organize this evidence using a Q–A–R–S framework that decomposes peer review into attributes of submissions (Q), authors (A), reviewers (R), and evaluation systems (S), and interpret outcomes through a view of the core problem of scientific evaluation as assessing new knowledge using the existing stock of knowledge.
The chapter treats experimental design choices as objects of analysis, assessing what existing interventions can—and cannot—identify given their designs and settings, the institutional constraints they face, and opportunities for higher-leverage experimentation. I show that randomized experimentation embedded in peer review spans the full Q–A–R–S space, albeit sparsely, and yields uneven but informative insights across different margins.
Based on the full body of evidence, I advance several novel claims: (1) system interventions often affect participant behavior with little impact on core evaluative judgments; (2) core evaluations are most clearly shaped by who reviews and their expertise; and (3) peer review functions more reliably as a “filter” of poor submissions than as a fine-grained “ranker” of acceptable submissions. Overall, the evidence points to a functioning institution operating under binding epistemic and organizational constraints, rather than to systemic failure. I identify channels for improving the speed, cost, and reliability of scientific evaluation institutions.
Substantial scope remains to redesign embedded experiments to increase inferential power, generalizability, and cumulative insight, while reducing disruption and more tightly linking to institutional innovation and policy changes.</content>

    <title>Searching for Fish in Trees (緣木求魚)? Economic Development when Context Matters</title>

      <name>Jacob Moscona, Nathan Nunn &amp; James A. Robinson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this chapter, we develop a framework for analyzing the determinants of economic development and their implications for policy. We distinguish between classical determinants—such as inputs into education and health, access to credit, and geography—and non-classical determinants—including cultural values, social norms, beliefs, identity, and social organization. We classify these determinants along two policy-relevant dimensions: whether they can be clearly ranked in terms of their contribution to development (vertical versus horizontal) and whether they can be directly altered through policy intervention (manipulable versus non-manipulable).We show that even for classical determinants, policy impacts are often hard to predict and are mediated by local social and cultural context. These issues are more pronounced for non-classical determinants, which are more complicated to change through policy intervention and more difficult to rank in welfare terms. In some cases, traits commonly viewed as obstacles to development may be well-adapted to local conditions or even supportive of economic performance, a possibility we refer to as “reverse vertical.” Building on Hirschman’s (1967) distinction between trait-making and trait-taking policymaking, we argue that interventions that attempt to directly transform non-classical determinants often rest on fragile assumptions about ranking and manipulability and risk generating unintended or adverse effects. By contrast, many of the most successful development episodes of the past several decades relied on policies that took existing social and cultural traits as given and designed institutions, technologies, and incentives that worked within those contexts rather than attempting to overturn them.</content>

    <title>Progress or Backsliding? Changes in the Gender Wage Gap for Business Professionals</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, much of the gap in earnings between men and women is due to the persistent gap for high wage earners. This paper explores changes in the gender wage gap for MBAs graduating from a large public university over 30 years. We document large gender wage gaps on average, which grow in the course of men’s and women’s careers. Comparing graduates at identical career stages across time periods to address composition concerns, we show that the raw gender wage gap has shrunk by 33 to 50 percent over the last two decades. Additionally, the temporal pattern of the gap has fundamentally shifted: while gaps only emerged over time in earlier decades, significant gaps now emerge immediately. Convergence in labor supply factors, particularly hours worked, explains much of the narrowing gap, alongside shifts in industry composition. However, unexplained wage gaps persist for recent graduates from the very start of their careers, suggesting different underlying mechanisms across cohorts. These findings highlight both progress in gender wage equity among business professionals and concerning patterns that emerge earlier in careers than in previous decades.</content>

    <title>AI Personality Extraction from Faces: Labor Market Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital—encompassing cognitive skills and personality traits—is central for labor-market success, yet personality remains difficult to measure at scale. Leveraging advances in AI and comprehensive LinkedIn microdata, we extract the Big 5 personality traits from facial images of 96,000 MBA graduates, and demonstrate that this novel “Photo Big 5” predicts school rank, job matching, compensation, job transitions, and career advancement. The Photo Big 5 provides predictive power comparable to race, attractiveness, and educational background, and is only weakly correlated with cognitive measures such as test scores. We show that individuals systematically sort into occupations where their personality traits are valued and earn higher wages when traits align with occupational demands. While the scalability of the Photo Big 5 enables new academic insights into the role of personality in labor markets, its growing use in industry screening raises important ethical concerns regarding statistical discrimination and individual autonomy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI use for content generation is associated with divergent outcomes on different financial social media platforms: indications of reasoning enhancement on Seeking Alpha, and of belief distortions on WallStreetBets. On Seeking Alpha, adoption is associated with information frictions. AI-assisted postings tilt toward  analysis/credibility, and their sentiment positively predicts future returns. Use of AI is associated with more informative retail order flow and lower bid-ask spreads. In contrast, AI adoption on WallStreetBets follows surges in retail buying, and AI-assisted  content is associated with emotionality and sentiment contagion. Such content precedes higher trading volume, greater volatility, and more lottery-like return distributions.</content>

    <title>Aggregate Employment and the Rise of Services across Time and Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the sectoral reallocation of employment over time and across countries, with a focus on the rise of services. We document substantial changes in the ratio of aggregate employment to working-age population across countries that are not systematically related to productivity growth or income levels, yet tightly linked to the rise in services employment. We assess the quantitative contribution of changes in aggregate employment to the rise of services using an otherwise standard model of sectoral reallocation calibrated to time-series for the United States. The calibrated model implies a high elasticity of changes in aggregate employment to services: a one percentage point change in aggregate employment generates on average a 0.7 percentage point change in services employment. The implication is that actual changes in aggregate employment account for one-third of the rise in services, on average across countries, and up to one-half in countries with sustained employment increases.</content>

    <title>Inferring Prices from Quantities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measuring aggregate inflation is subject to two opposing biases: unobserved quality and variety growth, and the use of incorrect weights when new varieties are misclassified. We show that it is possible to measure an aggregate price index free of these biases when we have a subset of products where these two errors average to zero. This procedure does not require us to distinguish new from existing goods, measure quality attributes directly, or classify new varieties into the appropriate category. We implement this approach using BEA data from 1959 to 2019, approximating the official PCE price index with a CES aggregate of BEA prices at the product level. Our estimate of the inflation rate exceeds the CES aggregate of BEA prices by 0.3 to 1.0 percentage points per year on average. The aggregate bias was close to zero prior to the BLS introducing hedonic adjustments, which suggests that only adjusting for quality bias can lead to an underestimation of overall inflation, particularly in quality-adjusted categories.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments rely on private firms to provide public goods and services. Although competition among these firms reduces prices and the costs of procurement, it has an ambiguous effect on fraud: competition can both dissipate the rents that attracted fraudulent firms to the market while at the same time reducing margins to the point where legitimate firms no longer remain viable. We study this tradeoff in the government’s procurement of durable medical equipment. Following Medicare’s switch from regulated prices to competitive bidding, we find that fraudulent firms’ cost advantage allowed them to gain market share as legitimate firms exited the market.</content>

    <title>Loan-funded Loans: Equity-like Liabilities inside Bank Holding Companies</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging regulatory data on fund flows within bank holding companies (BHCs), we characterize internal loans as a critical funding source for commercial banks. Although recorded as bank liabilities, parent-to-bank internal loans function as contingent support that resembles capital. We show that internal-loan funded banks do not hoard liquidity; instead, they originate larger and longer-maturity loans at lower spreads, initiate more relationships with marginal borrowers, and retain larger shares in syndicated deals. Internal-loan-funded lending is followed by higher short-run profits but higher future nonperforming loan ratios. We further show that organizational structure shapes internal lending: in BHCs with both bank and nonbank operations, nonbank affiliates crowd out internal lending to banks and discipline banks’ use of internal funds, and these BHCs exhibit higher overall performance. To identify our tests, we exploit the passage of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act and the announcement of the Basel III Accord, using instrumental variables and discontinuity-design approaches. Our findings highlight an equity-like internal debt channel that shapes monetary policy transmission, risk-taking, and the role of organizational structure in banking.</content>

    <title>Class Mobility in the Era of Rising Inequality: A Synthetic Dynasty Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies contemporary trends in class mobility using a new approach based on the “synthetic dynasties” represented in Markov chains. This approach yields several novel measures of movement and memory, which respectively capture how class positions differ from one generation to the next and how the influence of class origins dissipates across generations. Applying these methods to data from the U.S., we find that overall levels of movement and memory have remained largely stable across cohorts born between 1945 and 1990. This stability, however, masks offsetting class-specific trends. Among those from the upper and lower classes, movement has declined and memory has increased. In contrast, among the middle classes, movement has risen and memory has weakened.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much do people dislike opportunities they have never been exposed to, and why? We study how exposure affects work location decisions of casual workers. We offer short-term employment and randomize training locations to induce novel exposures. Participants sacrifice 22% of the median daily wage to avoid working in a location never visited before; one hour-long visit eliminates this premium. Workers anticipate two thirds of the effect exposure has on their later preferences. Results are most consistent with perceived fixed costs of exposure rather than sorting or quality uncertainty. Unfamiliar neighborhoods are also less likely to enter workers' consideration sets.</content>

    <title>Indebted Supply and Monetary Policy: A Theory of Financial Dominance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a New Keynesian model with financial frictions to study how corporate capital structure shapes static and dynamic monetary policy tradeoffs through the supply side. Ex post, when corporate leverage is high, monetary tightening contracts both demand and supply. As a result, the Phillips curve is highly non-linear and state-dependent, and the “natural rate” Rⁿ ensuring price stability increases with corporate leverage. Yet the tradeoff between inflation targeting and tightening supply constraints implies that the optimal ex-post policy is to set a rate Rᵒᵖᵗ &lt; Rⁿ that can decrease with leverage. Ex ante, firms’ market-timing incentives lead them to increase leverage when rates are low, which creates an intertemporal tradeoff: monetary easing supports current demand but hurts future supply, which makes easing partially self-defeating. The optimal ex-ante monetary policy features a prudential motive for leaning against leverage even when the divine coincidence holds in the current period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce experimental variation in the insurance contracts offered to rice farmers in China to study how contract design affects insurance takeup. We compare a single-contract offering with menus that include multiple contracts differing in premiums and payouts. Expanding the contract menu substantially increases take-up, primarily through higher adoption of the basic, lowest-cost contract. Additional experimental variation in relative prices and information provision shows that these effects are driven by context effects arising from relative price comparisons within the menu, rather than information inference. The findings highlight contract menu design as an effective supply-side tool for expanding insurance coverage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses microdata on U.S. mutual fund and ETF portfolios from SEC Form NPORT to study American investment in Chinese Renminbi (RMB)–denominated bonds. We show that, even as total foreign holdings of Chinese bonds rebounded in 2024, U.S. holdings of RMB bonds fell sharply and that most of this decline reflects funds exiting RMB positions entirely. These patterns point to a shift in the composition of China’s foreign investor base away from U.S. institutional investors and illustrate how publicly available microdata can inform work on international currency use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the impact of increased immigration on mortality among elderly Americans, who rely on the immigrant-intensive health and long-term care sectors. Using a shift-share approach we find a strong impact of immigration on the size of the immigrant care workforce: admitting 1,000 new immigrants would lead to 142 new foreign healthcare workers, without evidence of crowd out of native health care workers. We also find striking effects on mortality: a 25% increase in the steady state flow of immigrants to the US would result in 5,000 fewer deaths nationwide. We identify reduced use of nursing homes as a key mechanism driving this result.</content>

    <title>The Economic Impact of Mass Deportations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies the effects of large-scale deportations on wages, prices, and real incomes in the United States. We impute the legal status for each worker in the American Community Survey by combining detailed individual information with group-level visa records. In 2024, 3.2% of US workers were unauthorized, but some regions and sectors were heavily dependent on unauthorized immigrant labor. We develop a dynamic quantitative framework with multiple regions, sectors and occupations, heterogeneous workers, and endogenous capital accumulation to study the economic impacts of removing unauthorized workers. We derive analytical expressions relating region- and occupation-specific real wages and sectoral relative prices to changes in the supply of immigrant workers, observable factor shares, and combinations of structural elasticities. Following the removal of 50% of unauthorized immigrants, in the short run average native real wages rise 0.15% nationally, driven by an increase in the capital-labor ratio. In the long run, however, native real wages fall in every state, and by 0.33% nationally, as capital gets decumulated in response to a lower population. Consumer prices in the sectors intensive in unauthorized workers – such as Farming – rise by about 1% relative to the price of the average consumption basket, while most other sectors experience negligible relative price changes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can citizen-led protests lead to meaningful economic redistribution and nudge governments to increase redistributive fiscal transfers? We study the effects of protests on fiscal redistribution using evidence from Nigeria. We digitized twenty-six years of public finance data from 1988 to 2016 to examine the effects of protests on intergovernmental transfers. We find that protests increase transfers to protesting regions, but only in areas that are politically aligned with disbursing governments. Evidence from the large-scale 2012 Occupy Nigeria protests confirms these results. Protesters also face increased police violence, particularly in non-aligned regions. The results show that protests can influence fiscal redistribution.</content>

    <title>Heaven or Earth? The Evolving Role of Global Shocks for Domestic Monetary Policy</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business cycles are increasingly driven by global shocks, rather than the domestic demand shocks prominent in earlier decades, posing challenges for central banks seeking to meet domestic mandates and communicate their policy decisions. This paper analyzes the evolving influence and characteristics of global and domestic shocks in advanced economies from 1970-2024 using a new FAVAR model that decomposes movements in interest rates, inflation, and output growth into four global shocks (demand, supply, oil, and monetary policy) and three domestic shocks (demand, supply, and monetary policy). We find that the role of global shocks has increased sharply over time and that their characteristics differ from those of domestic shocks across multiple dimensions. Compared to domestic shocks, global shocks have a larger supply component, higher variance, more persistent effects on inflation, and are more asymmetric (contributing more to tightening than to easing phases of monetary policy). As global supply shocks have become more prominent, central banks have also been less willing to “look through” their effects on inflation than for comparable domestic shocks. The distinct characteristics and rising influence of global shocks—particularly global supply shocks—have significant implications for modeling monetary policy and designing central bank frameworks.</content>

    <title>School Vaping Bans and Youth E-Cigarette Use</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the goal of curbing electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use among youths, 40 states and the District of Columbia have adopted restrictions on nicotine vaping at elementary and secondary (K-12) schools. This study is the first to estimate the effect of K-12 school vaping restrictions (SVRs) on ENDS use among youth. Using data from several nationally representative data sources and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find little evidence that school indoor vaping restrictions reduce youth ENDS use. With 95% confidence, we can rule out SVR-induced youth vaping declines of more than 3.5%. Descriptive evidence suggests that students may respond to SVRs by substituting to smaller vaping devices and vaping in school locations that are less easily detectable by school employees (e.g., bathrooms and locker rooms). In contrast, we find that comprehensive vaping restrictions covering school campuses, workplaces, restaurants, and drinking establishments are associated with a 1.5-2.6 percentage-point reduction in teen nicotine vaping. This result is concentrated on the initiation margin of use and is consistent with the hypothesis that broader place-based restrictions increase the costs of youth ENDS use.</content>

    <title>Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework, with Application to Global Equity Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper.  In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are  orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a  detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish three facts about work from home (WFH) in the United States. First, employees WFH more often at younger firms – almost twice as often at firms founded after 2015 than at firms founded before 1990. Second, employees working under younger CEOs have higher levels of WFH. The average WFH rate is 1.4 days per week when the CEO is under 30, compared to 1.1 days when the CEO is 60 or older. Third, the self-employed WFH more than twice as often as wage-and-salary employees. These facts highlight the importance of organizational and managerial attributes for the prevalence of WFH.</content>

    <title>Extractive Taxation and the French Revolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we provide systematic evidence in support of the long-standing hypothesis that taxation was an important driver of the French Revolution. We first document that areas with heavier taxes experienced more riots between 1750 and 1789 and voiced more complaints against taxation in the cahiers de doléances of 1789. After showing that these effects are driven by indirect taxes, we exploit sharp spatial differences in the salt tax and the traites—the two principal indirect levies—to implement a regression discontinuity design (RDD).We find that unrest was higher on the high-tax side of the border. These effects intensified over time, peaking in the 1780s, and were stronger where fiscal disparities were larger and Enlightenment ideas more widespread. We further show that adverse weather shocks amplified unrest in high-tax municipalities. We then document that taxation fueled the spread of unrest during the Grande Peur—the wave of revolts that swept France in July 1789 and culminated in the abolition of feudal privileges. Finally, we link taxation to revolutionary politics in Paris, documenting that deputies from heavily taxed constituencies were more likely to frame the tax system as oppressive, support the Revolution, demand the abolition of the monarchy, and vote for the king’s execution.</content>

    <title>Interest Rates and Equity Valuations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large body of work has sought to measure the effect of interest rates on equity valuations. The challenge in doing so is that both are endogenous, and their comovement depends on the forces driving interest-rate changes. To address this problem, we develop and estimate a decomposition that splits movements in real rates into three structural drivers: changes in expected growth, risk, or “pure discounting.” We show that only pure discount-rate shocks transmit one-for-one to equity valuations, with little or negative transmission of growth and risk shocks. Implementing our decomposition with a global panel of growth expectations and asset prices, we find a weak unconditional relation between valuations and real rates but a strong relation with the pure discounting component, which explains 80% of cross-country valuation changes since 1990. In the U.S., we find that 35% of the interest-rate decline is attributable to pure discounting, implying that only a fraction of the change in rates has passed through directly to equities. We use the decomposition to revisit evidence on the role of interest rates in explaining price variation, and to study higher-frequency returns, cross-sectional rate exposures, duration-matched equity premia, and reactions to monetary policy.</content>

    <title>ICE Arrests across Trump's First and Second Terms: Variation in Targeting, Method, and Geography</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deportation is often framed as a necessary tool to protect public safety by removing people who commit crimes. We use newly available, and externally validated, administrative data containing all US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests from September 2015-October 2025. Beyond demonstrating national trends in immigration arrests by method and composition over time, we are also able to compare, for the first time, apprehensions spanning the start of the two Trump administrations, both of which focused on mass immigration enforcement. Our results reveal that the reality of immigration enforcement diverges sharply from the public narrative: while arrests spiked at the outset of both Trump presidencies, there were significant declines in the percentage of arrested individuals with criminal convictions, with especially marked declines in 2025. Examining potential mechanisms reveals that this is driven by a change in ICE tactics, but even conditional on tactic, as arrests rose, the percent with a criminal record declined. Moreover, we find substantial heterogeneity over time and across ICE Areas of Responsibility. Taken together, our results highlight a substantial gap between political rhetoric and reality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using new data from the Gallup Workforce Panel, we document a persistent partisan gap in self-reported AI use at work: Democrats are consistently more likely than Republicans to report frequent use. In 2025:Q4, for example, 27.8% of Democrats report using AI weekly or daily, compared with 22.5% of Republicans. Democrats also report deeper task-level integration, using AI in 16% more work activities than Republicans. Consistent with this, Democrats are employed in occupations with higher predicted AI exposure based on task-content measures and report larger perceived differences in AI-related job displacement risk. However, in regression models the partisan gap in AI use disappears once we control for education, industry, and occupation, indicating that observed differences primarily reflect compositional variation rather than political affiliation per se.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Colombian coca cultivation fell dramatically between 2000 and 2015, a period that saw intense U.S.-backed eradication and interdiction efforts. That progress reversed in 2015, when peace talks and legal rulings in Colombia opened enforcement gaps. Coca plantation has since increased to record levels, which coincided with a sharp rise in cocaine-related overdose deaths in the U.S. We estimate how much of that rise can be causally attributed to Colombia’s new coca boom. Leveraging the unforeseen coca supply shock and cross-county differences in pre-shock cocaine exposure, we find that the surge in supply caused an immediate rise in overdose mortality in the U.S. Our analysis estimates on the order of 1,000–1,500 additional U.S. deaths per year in the late 2010s can be attributed to Colombia’s cocaine boom. Implicit annual loss in American statistical life values about $48,000 per hectare of cultivation in Colombia. If left untamed, the current level of coca cultivation (over 230,000 ha in 2022) may impose on the order of $10 billion per year in costs via overdose fatalities.</content>

    <title>How Does Tort Reform Affect Health Care Delivery?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health care costs in the U.S. have grown dramatically over the past several decades, with one possible cause being physicians providing unnecessary services out of fear of being sued for malpractice – a phenomenon known as “defensive medicine”. States responded by enacting different types of tort reforms. This paper reviews the literature on the effects of these tort reforms on outcomes related to malpractice risk, quantity and quality of health care services, overall utilization and expenditures, physician supply, and patient affordability. We use Google Scholar to identify papers that fall into this scope and use either associational or quasi-experimental quantitative methods. The preponderance of evidence points towards non-economic damage caps reducing malpractice risk, quantity of services (aside from diagnostics and obstetrics), and overall health care utilization and expenditures while increasing physician supply and not having detrimental effects on patient outcomes. In general, the effects of other types of tort reforms are less clear. The literature would benefit from further research utilizing recent methodological advances related to combining machine learning with causal inference and eliminating bias from heterogeneous treatment effects in staggered-treatment-time models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use frontier advancements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to extract and classify the part of key economic agents’ behaviors that are predictable from past behaviors.  Even the agents themselves might view these as novel (innovative) decisions; however, we show in strong contrast that a large percentage of these actions and behaviors can be predicted—and thus mimicked—in the absence of these individuals. In particular, we show that 71% of mutual fund managers’ trade directions can be predicted in the absence of the agent making a single trade. For some managers, this increases to nearly all of their trades in a given quarter. Further, we find that manager behavior is more predictable and replicable for managers who have a longer history of trading and are in less competitive categories. The larger the ownership stake of the manager in the fund, the less predictable their behavior. Lastly, we show strong performance implications: less predictable managers strongly outperform their peers, while the most predictable managers significantly underperform. Even within each manager's portfolio, those stock positions that are more difficult to predict strongly outperform those that are easier to predict. Aggregating across the universe of fund managers each quarter, stocks whose position changes are least predictable additionally significantly outperform stocks whose position changes are most predictable across the universe. Our framework allows researchers to delineate and classify the portion of financial agents’ action sets which are predictable from those which are novel responses to stimuli -- open to being evaluated for value creation or destruction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Allocation mechanisms in M&amp;A deals are complex, but a main feature is that a target board controls who to invite to the sale. In a theoretical model, we show that it is optimal for the target to invite fewer potential acquirers when they are more homogeneous (i.e., when their values for the target are more correlated). Furthermore, greater correlation (and hence a smaller optimal bidder pool) yields the target a higher surplus from the sale (i.e., higher premium). We test the model empirically and show that M&amp;A deals with smaller bidder pools are associated with higher target returns. This is not a result of synergies in the deals: the target's share of the surplus is  simply higher in deals with smaller bidder pools. Finally, we show that cash deals are associated with larger, whereas stock deals have smaller, pools of bidders.</content>

    <title>The Differential Impacts of Critical Mineral Prices and Oil Prices on the Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper compares the impacts of critical mineral price and oil price on an economy in a unified neoclassical growth model. Unlike oil price shocks, which affect the cost of utilizing existing capital (e.g., cars), critical mineral price shocks influence the cost of creating new capital (e.g., electric vehicles) without altering the cost of existing capital. We find that both types of shocks ultimately reduce output and welfare. However, oil-price increases are systematically more contractionary for the economy. Mineral-price increases generate comparatively larger adjustments in investment, capital, and external borrowing but smaller and more gradual losses in output and welfare, and in capital-rich economies can slightly raise long-run employment. These results imply that oil-price shocks remain the more serious threat to aggregate activity and welfare, whereas mineral-price shocks call for policies that smooth investment and external-balance-sheet adjustment (e.g., macroprudential tools and precautionary reserves or fiscal buffers).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using confidential transaction-level data on overnight tri-party Treasury repo from 2018–2025, we study liquidity flows within bank holding companies (BHCs) between primary dealers and affiliated entities. Affiliates, especially depository institutions with abundant reserves, provide a large share of dealers’ repo funding, yet affiliated repo borrowing is systematically more expensive: dealers pay an affiliation premium of about 4–5 bps relative to otherwise comparable unaffiliated trades, even after controlling for trade characteristics and market conditions. We interpret this premium as an internal transfer price. Because consolidated leverage regulation nets intra-BHC positions and lowers the marginal balance sheet cost of funding moved within the group, affiliated trades generate a regulatory "rent" that is shared between the dealer and the affiliate. Consistent with this mechanism, the premium widens when dealer balance sheet constraints are tighter, compresses sharply  during a temporary leverage regulation exemption for reserves and Treasuries, and reappears after reinstatement. Finally, we estimate the pass-through of this internal liquidity channel to the broader financial system.</content>

    <title>How Do Workers Think About The Costs and Benefits of Freelance Work? New Evidence From a Survey Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how workers perceive the trade-offs of freelancing using a novel survey design that explores the nature of workers' perceptions of their own jobs and the implications of work arrangements for their take-home pay. We find that, across several alternative classifications of freelance work, workers in such arrangements make less per hour than traditional employees, but report having greater control of when, where, and how they work. We find that on average, self-employed workers spend an additional 5 to 8 percentage points of gross pay covering unreimbursed expenses relative to traditional employees. However, when asked about expectations of net pay in freelance and traditional employment jobs with the same gross pay, respondents who received no quantitative information expected net pay to be higher in freelance arrangements than in employment arrangements, on average. This pattern reversed among respondents who were randomly assigned to receive customized estimates of their expected total expense and tax burdens in each arrangement, who estimated that freelance arrangements would generate lower net lower earnings than employment arrangements (consistent with the estimates we provided to them). This suggests that workers may not be fully aware of the tax and expense burdens freelance workers are responsible for. Interestingly, we find similar results both for workers who are currently employees in their main job and those who are currently self-employed, suggesting that the low salience of the tax and expense burdens associated with freelance work are not merely driven by those with no self-employment experience.</content>

    <title>Classrooms as Workplaces: How Student Composition Affects Teacher Health</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work-related burnout and stress-related sickness absence have become increasingly prevalent, but evidence on which workplace features shape workers’ mental health remains limited. Using population-level Swedish register data covering all lower- and upper-secondary teachers from 2006–2024, we show that schools serving more disadvantaged students exhibit substantially higher rates of sickness absence, particularly for stress-related diagnoses. Exploiting within-teacher variation across student cohorts, we separate sorting from exposure and find that a one standard deviation increase in student disadvantage raises overall and stress-related sick leave by 3.6% and 8.7%, respectively. Survey evidence indicates that these effects operate through classroom conditions rather than workload or organizational differences. The findings establish client composition as a distinct and policy-relevant determinant of worker health in contact-intensive occupations.</content>

    <title>The Silk Road of Ashes: Exposure to NAFTA and Adult Mortality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 resulted in a great restructuring in industry composition in the US, with substantial heterogeneity across local areas. In this paper, we investigate the effects of NAFTA on the mortality rates of the working-age population. We implement event studies and difference-in-difference analyses to examine dynamic changes in mortality rates in different years relative to NAFTA and in areas with differential exposure to NAFTA. Comparing areas with high versus low trade exposure measures, we find a 2.1 percent rise in the mortality rate of those aged 25-55. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests a 7.3 percent rise in mortality for the treated population, who lost their job due to NAFTA. Further analyses using a wide range of alternative data sources suggest that reductions in income-employment, reductions in wealth, increases in disability, decreases in health insurance coverage, decreases in private health insurance, and a higher likelihood of reliance on presumably lower quality public insurance as candidate mechanisms.</content>

    <title>Interest Rate Pass-Through With Adjustable Rate Mortgages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) transmit monetary policy less directly than often assumed. We exploit quasi-experimental variation in ARM rate reset timing in Portugal—where over 92% of mortgages are indexed to Euribor—around the ECB’s 2022–2023 tightening cycle to estimate responses to mortgage payment shocks. After reset dates, mortgage renegotiations increase by 10 percentage points, lender switching by 4, partial prepayments by 5, and full prepayments by 3, offsetting about 17% of the payment increase implied by policy rates. Responses occur only immediately after resets, consistent with selective inattention, and are largest among younger, more educated, and higher-balance borrowers. Supply-side factors amplify these effects: as rates rise and bank competition intensifies, households at more flexible banks renegotiate, switch lenders, and prepay more, while greater broker presence further increases lender switching. Our findings suggest that monetary policy pass-through in ARM-dominated markets depends on borrower behavior, market frictions, and sticky deposit rates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic quantitative model of trade and labor adjustment, incorporating nominal wage rigidity and consumption–saving decisions, to study how China’s currency peg interacted with its rapid growth in shaping the US economy. We show that the peg temporarily boosts China’s export growth by preventing an appreciation of the Chinese currency, thereby amplifying the US labor-market consequences of the China shock. At the same time, the temporary export boom increases China’s savings and leads to a larger US trade deficit. Calibrating the model to match trade and labor-market flow data, we find that China’s currency peg played a quantitatively important role in the US manufacturing decline, the widening US trade deficit, and unemployment dynamics. These results underscore the importance of exchange-rate adjustment (or the lack thereof) for understanding trade shocks. We also find that the overall welfare impact of the China shock remains significant and positive.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Little is known about the impact on small-scale enterprises of a large negative shock that destroys assets and disrupts local markets. We document the short- and long-run impacts of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami using longitudinal household survey data. We leverage topography-driven variation in exposure to the tsunami in coastal Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. There are large short-run declines in business ownership, real profits, and real business assets among those exposed to the tsunami relative to comparison individuals who were not directly exposed. The gap in ownership rates disappears within two years in the non-agricultural sector but persists for 15 years in the agricultural sector. Profits and business assets of the exposed remain substantially lower through the long-term. Tsunami exposure led to increased short-duration transitions into and out of business ownership. Housing aid is linked to higher rates of non-agricultural business ownership and profits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investment in equipment and structures is one of the most cyclical components of GDP, a fact often associated with a negative response to heightened uncertainty in recessions. R&amp;D investment, by contrast, is only mildly procyclical. We show that this difference could arise because of a positive response of R&amp;D investment to uncertainty - promoting more research, development, and experimentation - a feature of most recessions but most notably during COVID. Both effects are distinct manifestations of real options, one in which costly reversibility delays investment, and the other in which investment enhances resolution of uncertainty.</content>

    <title>Incentives and Prosocial Discomfort: A Laboratory Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a within-subject laboratory experiment in which participants decided whether to experience physical discomfort for charity, with or without additional personal compensation. Acceptance decreased with greater discomfort and increased with both larger charitable donations and personal payments. We show that private monetary incentives and prosocial benefits interact in a less-than-additive way: personal compensation raises participation but attenuates the marginal impact of charitable donations, making the combined impact of private and social rewards smaller than the sum of their separate effects. We also find suggestive evidence that the sequencing of compensated and uncompensated choices may change the responsiveness to charitable benefits. Overall, our results indicate that context, especially the presence (and timing) of private rewards, can affect the relationship between incentives and prosocial behavior.</content>

Investors extrapolating from realized returns without recognizing selection bias and survivorship faced a substantial risk of disappointment. As our data and simulations confirm, successful NFT investing during the bubble required an almost perfect confluence of timing, liquidity, and luck.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present the first representative international data on firm-level AI use. We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation.</content>

    <title>Self-assessed Life-Cycle Saving Behavior in the U.S. and Singapore: Procrastination Versus Economic Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is widely believed that procrastination contributes to under-saving. Using household survey data from the United States and Singapore, we find little evidence to support this view. In both countries, indicators of procrastination have only weak, if any, explanatory power for saving regret. About half of respondents aged 60–74 expressed regret about not having saved more, but this sentiment was primarily associated with exposure to economic shocks rather than procrastination. A larger share of U.S. respondents reported saving regret, reflecting their greater exposure to adverse shocks. In contrast, Singapore’s system of mandatory saving for retirement, housing, and health expenses appears to mitigate the long-term financial impact of such shocks. However, with little opportunity for risk pooling, Singapore households still remain vulnerable to shocks. These findings highlight the importance of institutional design in risk protection over the lifecycle.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present the GABRIEL software package, which uses GPT to quantify attributes in qualitative data (e.g. how “pro innovation” a speech is). GPT is evaluated on classification and attribute rating performance against 1000+ human annotated tasks across a range of topics and data. We find that GPT as a measurement tool is accurate across domains and generally indistinguishable from human evaluators. Our evidence indicates that labeling results do not depend on the exact prompting strategy used, and that GPT is not relying on training data contamination or inferring attributes from other attributes. We showcase the possibilities of GABRIEL by quantifying novel and granular trends in Congressional remarks, social media toxicity, and county-level school curricula. We then apply GABRIEL to study the history of tech adoption, using it to assemble a novel dataset of 37,000 technologies. Our analysis documents a tenfold decline of time lags from invention to adoption over the industrial age, from ~50 years to ~5 years today. We quantify the increasing dominance of companies and the U.S. in innovation, alongside characteristics that explain whether a technology will be adopted slowly or speedily.</content>

In addition, we investigate growth in learning due to innate, parental, and environmental factors that occur in the absence of any formal intervention.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender norms—shared expectations about appropriate behavior by gender—shape the outcomes of men and women across societies, and are correlated with GDP per capita. This chapter surveys the literature on gender norms and economic development, focusing on the pervasive and traditional ‘male breadwinner norm’ that assigns men to market work and women to domestic responsibilities. We review empirical approaches to measuring norms, including direct survey questions on attitudes, second-order beliefs about others' views, and behavioral proxies. Establishing causal effects of norms on behavior poses significant challenges, and we review a range of approaches to identify this link. We then present the leading hypotheses about the origins of gender norms in different forms of biological comparative advantage. We discuss societal forces sustaining norms, including self-reinforcing feedback between behavior and beliefs, other institutions, and backlash against norm violations. We highlight the bidirectional relationship between norms and development: economic growth can liberalize norms through structural transformation, legal reforms, and diffusion mechanisms, whereas talent misallocation stemming from gender norms may constrain growth. We conclude by discussing gender norms beyond the breadwinner domain, including norms around kinship, property, leadership, violence, mobility, sexuality, appearance, and behavior, and identify promising directions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women’s employment remains highly sensitive to childcare constraints, making childcare availability a critical lever for supporting mothers’ labor force attachment. We study the effects of expanded full-day programming in Head Start, using the 2016 federal funding initiative that targeted grantees with low full-day enrollment. Linking administrative program data, geo-coded center locations, and household data on employment, we estimate a difference-in-differences design by comparing mothers of young children in treated and untreated areas. The policy increased full-day enrollment by 19 percent and raised single mothers’ employment (1.9%), hours (2.5%), and earnings (6.5%). Results show that extending program duration meaningfully improves maternal labor market outcomes.</content>

    <title>Using Life Satisfaction Data to Measure Parents' Child Gender Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can questions about life satisfaction be used to measure parental preferences for daughters versus sons? Daughter preference has rarely been documented in the literature, even in matrilineal settings. One possible reason is that the commonly used measures of parental gender preference, such as fertility-stopping rules and sex ratio at birth, are ill-suited to high-fertility settings. We instead assess maternal preferences in Malawi by examining the life satisfaction of women who currently have one child, comparing those with a daughter to those with a son.  We find that in matrilineal (but not patrilineal) households, having a daughter increases mothers' life satisfaction, relative to having a son.</content>

    <title>Mass Media and Contraception Use: An Experimental Test of Modernization Theory in Burkina Faso</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper tests whether the arrival of mass media triggers a decline in fertility, a central prediction of modernization theory. Using a field experiment, we vary exposure to mass media and its content in a quarter of Burkina Faso. We provide radios to 1,600 women without previous access to mass media. Half live in status quo areas and half in areas where the local radio station was randomly selected to air a science-based family planning campaign. Contrary to modernization theory and previous literature, gaining access to status quo mass media decreases contraception use by 14 percent and reinforces traditional gender norms. In contrast, receiving a radio in campaign areas boosts contraception use by 16 percent. The campaign also led to a 9 percent reduction in births and a 0.3 standard deviation increase in reported welfare. Reduced belief in misinformation rather than shifts in attitudes and preferences drives the result.</content>

    <title>Seeing Green: The Effects of Financial Exposures on Support for Climate Action</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the large common net benefits of climate mitigation, broad-based political consensus for large-scale policy action remains elusive. We hypothesize that financial exposure to energy stocks central to the green transition can induce learning and greater support for climate mitigation policies. We conduct a RCT which randomizes both the presence of financial market exposure to the energy sector, as well as which type of portfolio—fossil-fuel (brown) or renewable energy (green)—is given to an individual. Treatment increases support for mitigation action and intent to undertake adaptation, with positive support caused by ownership of both green and brown assets. The effects are particularly pronounced among individuals who are initially more climate-skeptic, and persist eight months after treatment. We present evidence consistent with learning as the primary mechanism: treated respondents are more likely to consume financial news and become more financially knowledgeable, less likely to obtain news from polarized sources, and better able to accurately predict the environmental impacts of green and brown firms.</content>

    <title>Threshold Disclosure in Collective Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Voting-based collective decisions are typically made either anonymously or publicly. Anonymous voting protects truthful expression but conceals individual behavior; public voting provides information about individual votes, but, when one option is socially stigmatized, it can distort participation and choices. We introduce threshold majority voting, in which voters choose a disclosure threshold determining whether and when their votes are revealed. In an experiment at UC Berkeley on the participation of transgender women in women’s sports, public voting nearly doubles abstention and reduces support for the stigmatized option. Threshold voting eliminates these distortions while revealing one-third of individual votes.</content>

    <title>Is Teacher Effectiveness Fully Portable? Evidence from the Random Assignment of Transfer Incentives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how performance changes when teachers transfer across very different school contexts. The Talent Transfer Initiative program created a rare natural experiment to study such transfers by randomly assigning low-achieving schools the ability to offer high-performing teachers at higher-achieving schools a $20,000 transfer stipend. Forecast tests show that these high-performing teachers’ prior value added is only moderately predictive of their effectiveness in low-achieving schools. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we estimate that incentivized-transfer teachers’ value added dropped by 0.12 student standard deviations. This decline appears to be driven by lower match quality, negative indirect school effects, and the loss of student-specific human capital.</content>

    <title>Bank Failures: The Roles of Solvency and Liquidity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bank failures can stem from runs on otherwise solvent banks or from losses that render banks insolvent, regardless of withdrawals. Disentangling the relative importance of liquidity and solvency in explaining bank failures is central to understanding financial crises and designing effective financial stability policies. This paper reviews evidence on the causes of bank failures. Bank failures---both with and without runs---are almost always related to poor fundamentals. Low recovery rates in failure suggest that most failed banks that experienced runs were likely fundamentally insolvent.  Examiners' postmortem assessments also emphasize the primacy of poor asset quality and solvency problems. Before deposit insurance, runs commonly triggered the failure of insolvent banks. However, runs rarely caused the failure of strong banks, as such runs were typically resolved through other mechanisms, including interbank cooperation, equity injections, public signals of strength, or suspension of convertibility. We discuss the policy implications of these findings and outline directions for future research.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Effects of Tariffs: Evidence From U.S. Historical Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the macroeconomic effects of tariff policy using U.S. historical data from 1840–2024. We construct a narrative series of plausibly exogenous tariff changes – based on major legislative actions, multilateral negotiations, and temporary surcharges – and use it as an instrument to identify a structural tariff shock. Tariff increases are contractionary: imports fall sharply, exports decline with a lag, and output and manufacturing activity drop persistently. The shock transmits through both supply and demand channels. Prices rise in the full sample but fall post-World War II, a pattern consistent with changes in the monetary policy response and with stronger international retaliation and reciprocity in the modern trade regime.</content>

    <title>Does Generative AI Narrow Education-Based Productivity Gaps? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does generative artificial intelligence (AI) reinforce or reduce productivity differences across workers? Existing evidence largely studies AI within firms and occupations, where organizational selection compresses educational heterogeneity, leaving unclear whether AI narrows productivity gaps across individuals with substantially different levels of formal education. We address this question using a randomized online experiment conducted outside firms, in which 1,174 adults ages 25–45 with heterogeneous educational backgrounds complete an incentivized, workplace-style business problem-solving task. The task is a general (not domain specific) exercise, and participants perform it either with or without access to a generative-AI assistant. Unlike prior work that studies heterogeneity within relatively homogeneous worker samples, our design targets the between–education-group productivity gap as the primary estimand. We find that AI increases productivity for all participants, with substantially larger gains for lower-education individuals. In the absence of AI access, higher-education participants outperform lower-education participants by 0.548 standard deviations; with AI access, this gap falls to 0.139 standard deviations, implying that generative AI closes about three quarters of the initial productivity gap. We interpret this pattern as evidence that generative AI narrows effective productivity differences in task execution by relaxing cognitive constraints that are more binding for lower-education individuals, even though underlying skill differences remain, as reflected in persistent education gaps in task performance and in a follow-up exercise without AI assistance.</content>

    <title>Managing the Entrepreneur's Miracle Budget</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial ventures typically require multiple independent conditions to hold simultaneously for success. This paper develops a formal framework for decision-making under such multiplicative uncertainty. When a venture's success depends on several factors—each of which must resolve favourably—even modestly uncertain factors compound to produce low overall success probabilities. I introduce the concept of a miracle budget: the maximum aggregate uncertainty a venture can carry while remaining viable. The miracle budget increases with a venture's payoff-to-cost ratio but only logarithmically, so even transformative opportunities buy only modest additional slack in aggregate uncertainty. The framework characterises optimal experimentation strategies, including the value of information from different experimental designs, conditions for optimal sequencing of experiments, and the allocation of experimental effort across uncertain factors. A hierarchical model distinguishes real miracles—genuinely uncertain factors that can only be resolved by trying—from apparent miracles—factors that seem uncertain but can be resolved through investigation. The framework yields actionable principles for early-stage entrepreneurs: compute your budget, prioritise low-cost tests with high “kill” probability (and, when experiment costs are similar, start with the most uncertain factors), and focus early-stage work on learning how many miracles you actually face.</content>

    <title>A Population Perspective on the Beneficiaries of Public and Private Assistance Immediately and over the Long-term After a Major Disaster</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Natural disasters undermine economic development, destroying lives, livelihoods, the built and natural environment. Public assistance programs follow, but knowledge of their reach, impact and evolution is limited. We address this gap, analyzing population-representative longitudinal survey data collected in Indonesia before and for two decades after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami which was followed by a large recovery program involving multiple major actors.  Those who lived, at the time of the tsunami, in communities that were badly damaged, were far more likely to receive aid and received larger amounts than residents of other areas immediately after the tsunami. Those gaps were small and insignificant four years post-tsunami. Conditional on exposure, individual attributes also shaped receipt which reached the vulnerable, particularly poor and female-headed households. Housing assistance, distributed several years post-tsunami to those who lost homes, was critical in the eyes of recipients, playing a key role as they rebuilt livelihoods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Frontline workers in public bureaucracies perform multidimensional tasks and rely on supervisors who both monitor performance and supply essential managerial inputs. We study how incentive design should account for these interactions using a conceptual framework and a province-wide randomized experiment with the Punjab Agriculture Extension Department in Pakistan. Across 131 tehsils, we compare: (i) an Objective pay-for-performance scheme tied to digital activity metrics; (ii) a Subjective scheme in which supervisors allocate bonuses; and (iii) a Subjective Plus scheme that preserves discretion but introduces light-touch oversight of supervisors.
All three schemes increase outreach, but through distinct channels. Objective incentives primarily raise intensive effort—repeat visits to the same farmers—while Subjective Plus expands the extensive margin by inducing supervisors to schedule more farmer trainings and broaden geographic coverage. Contrary to standard multitasking concerns, meeting length—a proxy for engagement quality—increases across all arms.
Oversight of supervisors also reduces favoritism in bonus allocation and improves merit-based evaluation, leading to greater access and yield gains among marginalized farmers. The results show that light-touch monitoring of middle management can substantially amplify the effectiveness and equity of performance pay in multi-layered bureaucracies.</content>

    <title>Marriage and the Intergenerational Mobility of Women: Evidence from Marriage Certificates 1850-1920</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that women’s economic mobility improved nearly a century before married women gained broad labor market opportunities. Using Massachusetts marriage registers linked to U.S. censuses (1850–1920), we create new father–child links for women to estimate intergenerational mobility and assortative mating, overcoming a key historical linkage barrier. Estimates from a structural marriage market model suggest assortative mating fell 61% from 1850–1870 to 1900–1920. Counterfactuals imply women’s mobility would have been far lower absent the decline in assortative mating. Had late cohorts faced early cohort sorting, the rank–rank slope between a woman’s father and husband would have been 2.5 times higher.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal simple rating systems that partition sellers into a finite number of tiers. We show that optimal ratings must be threshold partitions, and that for linear supply and Cournot competition with constant marginal cost, optimal thresholds solve a k-means clustering problem requiring only the quality distribution. For convex (concave) supply functions, optimal thresholds are higher (lower) than the k-means solution. For log-concave distributions, two-tier certification captures at least 50 percent of maximum welfare gains from full disclosure, with five tiers typically achieving over 90 percent. Applications to eBay and Medicare Advantage data illustrate our method.</content>

    <title>Trading Goods for Lives: NAFTA’s Mortality Impacts and Implications</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the mortality impact of local labor market exposure to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as well as to other local area shocks, and provide a parsimonious empirical explanation for differently-signed mortality estimates across different sources of local labor market contractions. Leveraging spatial variation in exposure to Mexican important competition from NAFTA, we find that more exposed areas experienced larger increases in mortality. In the 15 years post-NAFTA, an area with average NAFTA exposure experienced an increase in annual, age-adjusted mortality of 0.68 percent (standard error = 0.19), an increase that more than erases prior estimates of the welfare gains from NAFTA’s nationwide economic benefits. Mortality increases appear across all broad age by sex groups, but are particularly pronounced among working-age men, a demographic that also experienced disproportionate NAFTA-induced declines in (primarily manufacturing) employment. Additional evidence from other local labor market shocks reveals a systematic pattern: declines in local area manufacturing employment increase mortality, while declines in local area non-manufacturing employment decrease mortality. These findings suggest that the sign and magnitude of any mortality impacts of future economic shocks likely depends critically on the extent to which employment declines are concentrated in the manufacturing sector.</content>

    <title>Drivers of Dollar Share in Foreign Exchange Reserves</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The share of US dollar assets in the official foreign exchange reserve portfolios of central banks, at times, is taken as an indicator of the dollar's global status. We provide a decomposition that shows two distinct channels contributing to the changes in the dollar share of reserves aggregated across countries: shifts in preferences for dollar assets, and changes in reserve balances driven by countries whose portfolio allocations differ from the aggregate. We document how the concentrated nature of foreign exchange reserve holdings allows countries that contribute a large share of aggregated reserves to exert substantial influence on aggregate dollar shares over time, potentially dominating the narrative. In recent periods, the key contributors to changes in aggregate preference shifts for dollar assets are changes in bilateral country trade with the United States and dollar debt share, with geopolitics additionally working through the investment tranches of central bank portfolios. Diversification away from dollar assets is more prevalent conditional on official reserves of countries being large enough to satisfy country liquidity needs.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Subsidy Harvesting in Livestock Price Insurance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;USDA designed the Livestock Risk Protection (LRP) program to help producers insure against declining prices for fed cattle, feeder cattle, and swine. Prices in derivatives markets determine program indemnities, making LRP policies similar to put options. Beginning in 2019, USDA made several changes to the program to encourage producer takeup, including increased premium subsidies. We introduce a theoretical model to show that subsidizing LRP premiums invites producers to “subsidy harvest,” i.e. extract the subsidy as an arbitrage by simultaneously taking an offsetting position in the options market—potentially removing the downside protection the program was intended to provide. The subsidy harvest is a pure rent and costlier than a direct payment because it requires administrative oversight and federally-subsidized delivery through approved insurance providers. According to the model, the government’s premium subsidy leads producers to favor LRP-oriented strategies over market options alone, while their choice to offset actual risk protection using options depends on individual risk tolerance and wealth objectives.</content>

    <title>Shielding Women from Violence: The Effects of Violence Prevention and Monitoring Centers on Intimate Partner Violence in Türkiye</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intimate partner violence remains one of the most serious threats to women's safety worldwide, yet existing evidence on the effectiveness of large-scale institutional protection systems is limited and mixed. This paper evaluates the impact of Violence Prevention and Monitoring Centers on intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in Türkiye. Exploiting the staggered rollout of centers across provinces, we find that the opening of a center reduces female homicides, particularly those perpetrated by intimate partners, by approximately 20 percent. Complementary survey evidence shows that the opening of a center also reduces women's self-reported exposure to physical IPV by 20 percent, with larger effects among younger and less-educated women. Exploring potential mechanisms, we find that centers primarily reduce violence by lowering barriers to help-seeking and improving coordination across police, legal, and social services: following the opening of a center, women become more likely to seek support from women's organizations and social services, while direct applications to prosecutors decline. We find no evidence of effects on gender attitudes, labor market outcomes, relationship status, marriage market outcomes, or mental health, suggesting violence reductions operate through improved access to protection rather than changes in norms or economic independence. The estimated effects are stronger in provinces with more gender-progressive norms and stronger institutional capacity, highlighting the importance of complementary social and institutional environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the age composition of the population can shape the speed at which businesses adopt new technologies, using evidence from mobile payments in India. Consumers' propensity to use new payment technologies declines with age, creating stronger incentives for businesses serving younger customers to accept these technologies. We document this pattern in the rollout of a mobile payment option by a major fintech company. A model where consumer attitudes toward technology vary by age implies that business adoption is inefficiently low, with the young bearing disproportionate welfare losses from network externalities. Jointly subsidizing transaction and adoption costs restores efficiency.</content>

    <title>Industrial Policies for Multi-Stage Production: The Battle for Battery-Powered Vehicles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model a multi-stage supply chain for EVs from battery production to vehicle distribution. Given industrial policies, firms select where to open facilities at each stage. This is a difficult combinatorial choice problem that we solve with a fast mixed integer linear programming formulation. We estimate the variable and fixed costs parameters using SMM. Counterfactual simulations reveal a tension between boosting EV adoption and promoting domestic supply chains. Due to increasing returns, even unconditional subsidies raise the number of factories in the subsidizing region—by about 16% for EVs and 7% for cells in North America, and even more in Europe. Theoretically, local assembly requirements can push down delivered marginal costs relative to unconditional subsidies. Empirically, local content requirements quadruple the expansion of cell factories in America, but they drive up costs and reduce subsidy uptake, undoing more than half of the EV adoption stimulus coming from pure buyer subsidies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conducting a new survey on the Nielsen Consumer panel we examine the impact of working from home (WFH) on shopping, finding three key results. First, WFH changed shopping modes, increasing online shopping and the fraction of trips to stores on weekdays. Second, WFH increased total spending through increased product quantity and range, tilting expenditure towards food and general merchandise and away from health and beauty products. Finally, WFH increased prices paid by shoppers and lowered price elasticities due to a move towards higher-cost products and lower deal usage. The change in prices paid is concentrated among married households, driven by a redistribution of shopping responsibility within the household, especially when the new remote worker is male. We find that remote workers engage in more shopping trips but fewer minutes of shopping. Our results suggest that shifting to remote work increases prices paid for groceries by about 1%, highlighting how WFH is impacting households, retail and inflation.</content>

Firms with high intangible intensity are smaller, younger, and invest heavily in R&amp;D and human capital. The three subcomponents map cleanly to distinct economic firm types: knowledge-intensive firms are R&amp;D-driven with high valuations and skilled labor; customer-intensive firms are mature, profitable, and commercially oriented; and organization-intensive firms are large, asset-heavy incumbents. Managerial expenditure descriptions thus provide informative signals about intangible investment, complementing financial statements in capturing corporate capital stocks.</content>

    <title>Building Pro-Worker Artificial Intelligence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper defines pro-worker technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, as technologies that make human skills and expertise more valuable by expanding worker capabilities. Our conceptual framework distinguishes among five categories of technological change: labor-augmenting, capital-augmenting, automating, expertise-leveling, and new task-creating. Only the last category is unambiguously pro-worker, generating demand for novel human expertise rather than commodifying it. We illustrate these distinctions through hypothetical and real-world examples spanning aviation maintenance, electrical services, custodial work, education, patent examination, and gig delivery. While AI’s capacity to automate work is substantial, we argue that its potential to serve as a collaborator, by extending human judgment, enabling new tasks, and accelerating skill acquisition, is equally transformative and currently underexploited. We identify market failures, including misaligned firm and developer incentives, path dependence, and a pervasive pro-automation ideology, that may lead to underinvestment in pro-worker AI. We consider nine policy directions that would change incentives, including targeted investments in health care and education, tax code reform, antitrust enforcement, and intellectual property protections for worker expertise.</content>

    <title>The Local Origins of Business Formation: Entry as a Two-Stage Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The business entry literature typically observes firms only at the first hire. We provide a new perspective using linked administrative microdata tracking the universe of U.S. business applications and their transition into employer firms. We model entry as a two-stage process: pursuit of a business idea (proxied by a business application) and implementation (transition). Results show these margins are distinct and associate differently with local conditions. While both margins matter, high-startup locations are characterized by high application intensity, whereas low-startup locations exhibit low transition rates, suggesting geographic disparities in entry arise from different dynamics at each stage of the entrepreneurial process.</content>

    <title>Do Informal Social Markets and Online Sellers Help Youths to Avoid E-Cigarette Taxation?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Youths who vape nicotine rarely make in-person purchases of e-cigarettes from a vendor but instead rely on alternative methods to obtain electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products. This study is the first to explore whether the informal social market and online purchasing options help to insulate youths from e-cigarette taxation. Using data from the State Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Surveys, we find that ENDS taxation reduces both the likelihood of teens obtaining ENDS products through direct in-person retail purchases as well as the likelihood of relying on informal social sources for e-cigarettes such as borrowing vaping devices from friends or third-party purchases. Auxiliary analyses from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health are generally consistent with these findings and suggest that impacts are concentrated on the initiation margin; higher ENDS taxes deter youths initiating through direct retail purchases as well as through the social market. For older teens ages 18 and older, however, we find that informal social sources may attenuate the impacts of e-cigarette taxes. Finally, we detect some evidence that ENDS taxes increases the likelihood that teenagers shift to online sources to obtain e-cigarettes.</content>

    <title>Bank Runs and Interest Rates: A Revolving Lines Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Revolving credit is at the core of the banking business. Corporate revolving lines are demandable claims; thus, similar to a traditional run on deposits, sudden and widespread drawdowns can destabilize banks. However, unlike deposits, credit line utilization exhibits substantial interest rate sensitivity. As a result, a run on revolving credit lines is less likely in a high-interest-rate environment but can introduce vulnerabilities when policy rates are lowered. Using an interest rate discontinuity commonly embedded in commercial credit contracts, we propose a methodology to estimate the elasticity of credit demand and apply it to measure the sensitivity of precautionary drawdowns.</content>

    <title>Settlement of Litigation May Increase or Decrease Deterrence and Social Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the obvious effect of settlement is to save litigants the costs of trial, settlement also influences deterrence—and for two reasons. First, because settlement is agreed upon by plaintiffs, it raises their expected return from litigation and thus the probability of suit. This augments deterrence. Second, because settlement is agreed upon by defendants, it lowers their expected costs of litigation and therefore dilutes deterrence. The primary objective of the article is to identify the net effect of settlement on deterrence and on social welfare in a model of accidents, liability, and litigation. The conditions for the bringing of suit in the model are not only that plaintiffs be willing to go to trial, but also that their anticipated settlements would exceed their pretrial costs.</content>

    <title>Job Search, Job Amenities and the Gender Pay Gap</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies gender gaps in labor-market outcomes, with a focus on job ladder dynamics.  We show that women experience substantially lower wage growth conditional on prior wages despite nearly identical job-to-job transition rates for men and women. To reconcile these observations, we document gender differences in the valuation of nonwage job amenities and in job search behavior, and develop a multi-dimensional job-ladder model with endogenous search effort where workers value both wages and amenities. The model allows for gender heterogeneity in separation rates, search effort, the value of nonemployment, amenity valuations, and bargaining power, enabling a joint analysis of gender wage and employment gaps. A quantitative decomposition shows that differences in preferences for nonwage amenities account for nearly 40 percent of the gender pay gap. Differences in the value of nonemployment and bargaining power explain most of the remainder, with only a limited role for differences in separation rates and search behavior. Finally, we show that increases in job amenities—such as the expansion of remote work—raise the gender wage gap while reducing gender differences in employment.</content>

    <title>A Unified Urban Model With Non-Homothetic Housing Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Canonical urban models fail to jointly account for flexible housing demand, nondegenerate city sizes, and observed urban systems. We introduce a unifying urban framework based on price-independent generalized linear (PIGL) preferences in which housing is a necessity. Non-homothetic housing demand generates income effects that cause urban costs to scale more strongly with population than wages, restoring a unique interior efficient city size under standard assumptions. The framework nests existing canonical models, remains tractable, and is consistent with key empirical regularities, including Zipf’s law and observed housing price elasticities. We also encapsulate a monocentric city model into our framework.</content>

    <title>Household Responses to Private Risk Information</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how private information affects household responses to environmental risk. Using data from residential air quality monitors, we exploit the timing of monitor installation and high-frequency fine particulate matter (PM2.5) readings to identify responses to new information about indoor pollution risk. We find that indoor PM2.5 concentrations decline by 2.5 ug/m3 over the 12 weeks following installation, conditional on contemporaneous outdoor pollution, with effects significantly larger among households with high initial indoor pollution. The indoor–outdoor pollution gradient declines over time, indicating that households become increasingly effective at mitigating exposure when marginal health damages are highest. Using machine learning techniques to infer cooking activity and air purifier adoption, we show that households respond primarily through durable defensive investments rather than reductions in pollution-generating behavior, with back-of-the-envelope calculations implying positive net benefits. Our results suggest that personalized risk information increases the salience of indoor pollution as a controllable risk for households, in contrast to spatially coarse public information that frames pollution primarily as an outdoor threat requiring avoidance.</content>

    <title>Nonparametric Identification of Demand without Exogenous Product Characteristics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study identification of differentiated product demand from market-level data when product characteristics can be endogenous. Past work suggests nonparametric identification may be impossible: that is, in addition to standard price instruments, exogenous characteristic-based instruments are essentially necessary to identify sufficiently flexible demand models with standard index restrictions. We show, however, that price counterfactuals are nonparametrically identified using recentered instruments—which combine exogenous price instruments with possibly endogenous product characteristics—under a weaker index restriction and a new condition we term faithfulness. We argue that faithfulness, like the usual completeness condition for nonparametric instrumental variable identification, is best viewed as a technical requirement on the strength of identifying variation rather than a substantive economic or statistical restriction. We show the two conditions are closely related, though generally distinct. We conclude with several practical implications for the parametric estimation of demand counterfactuals.</content>

    <title>Job Loss and Health Insurance Coverage Before and After the Affordable Care Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) altered the insurance consequences of involuntary job loss. Using matched event-study models with longitudinal survey data, we estimate the causal effects of displacement on insurance coverage before and after implementation of the ACA’s main provisions. Prior to 2014, job loss reduced coverage by approximately 16 percentage points, with losses persisting for more than a year. After the ACA, declines are smaller—about 10 percentage points—and recovery is faster. Gains reflect higher baseline public coverage and reduced post-displacement losses, with the largest improvements among middle income workers previously most exposed to coverage disruptions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transformative artificial intelligence (TAI) - machines capable of performing virtually all economically valuable work - may gradually erode the two main tax bases that underpin modern tax systems: labor income and human consumption. We examine optimal taxation across two stages of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation. First, if AI displaces human labor, we find that consumption taxation may serve as a primary revenue instrument, with differential commodity taxation gaining renewed relevance as labor distortions lose their constraining role. In the second stage, as autonomous artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems both produce most economic value and absorb a growing share of resources, taxing human consumption may become an inadequate means of raising revenue. We show that the taxation of autonomous AGI systems can be framed as an optimal harvesting problem and find that the resulting tax rate on AGI depends on the rate at which humans discount the future. Our analysis provides a theoretically grounded approach to balancing efficiency and equity in the Age of AI. We also apply our insights to evaluate specific proposals such as taxes on robots, compute, and tokens, as well as sovereign wealth funds and windfall clauses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While a growing literature has documented the effect of neighborhoods on children, there is little evidence on how neighborhoods impact adults.  This study examines the impact of neighborhoods on high-needs families in Denmark who are quasi-randomly assigned to social housing in different neighborhoods.  Results indicate a one standard deviation improvement in nearby neighborhood quality causes a 0.08 standard deviation improvement in labor market outcomes, and a 2.8 percent reduction in the likelihood of criminal conviction.  Additional results indicate the labor market effects are most consistent with additional job referrals from nearby neighbors, rather than differences in local job availability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Range anxiety, the fear of depleting battery before reaching a charging station, is often cited as a major barrier to electric vehicle (EV) adoption, yet there has been limited formal economic analysis to quantify its magnitude and examine the policy implications. We develop a continuous-time dynamic model of EV usage and charging decisions to micro-found range anxiety as the utility loss from feasible yet unrealized trips due to perceived range constraints. Using high-frequency data of 188,000 EV trips and 26,000 charging events among 8,000 EVs in Shanghai, we recover model parameters governing consumer driving and charging decisions. The estimates imply that, across EV models with varying driving ranges, average range anxiety was about $1,900 in 2021 but declined to $1,200 in 2024, driven by improvements in charging infrastructure and, especially, increases in driving range. Policy simulations underscore the importance of coordinating investments in driving range and charging infrastructure to address range anxiety. Relative to socially optimal levels, Shanghai’s EV market has under-invested in driving range but over-invested in charging infrastructure.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document significant variation in interest rates among similar commercial and industrial loans using confidential supervisory data on the largest US banks. This dispersion does not appear to be due to risk. We rationalize the data using a search cost model and find that search costs are highest for smaller and riskier borrowers and lower for public firms, consistent with predictable differences in the costs of screening and monitoring. We find that search costs are substantial. Over a third of firms behave as if they do not comparison shop; half of all firms appear to only obtain two quotes before picking a lender, while the remaining firms behave as if they search widely.</content>

    <title>Why has Decreasing Schooling Inequality Not Led to Decreasing Earnings Inequality in South Africa?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inequality in education has declined substantially in South Africa since the end of apartheid, with inequality in years of completed education declining by all standard measures of inequality. At the same time, inequality in earnings has not shown significant declines, and has increased by some measures. Given the strong positive relationship between earnings and years of education, why hasn’t the decline in education inequality led to declines in earnings inequality? This paper explores this puzzle from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. We analyse how earnings inequality is affected by changes in returns to schooling when returns increase at some levels of schooling and decrease at other levels. We show that changes in the distribution of education over the 1994-2019 period would have significantly reduced earnings inequality in and of themselves. This was offset by disequalizing changes in the earnings-education gradient, including an increase in relative earnings for those with post-secondary education and a decrease in relative earnings for those with incomplete secondary education. The net result is a combination of decreasing schooling inequality and persistently high earnings inequality,</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assemble the first comprehensive sample of venture fraud cases involving 614 U.S. venture capital (VC)-backed startups founded since 2000. We find that VC-backed firms are 54% more likely to face fraud charges than comparable non-VC-backed firms within a subsample of newly public firms where detection likelihood is high and homogeneous. We then examine the role of governance in explaining venture fraud, focusing on two features that have risen in recent years—founder-friendly structures and cap table complexity. In a panel prediction model examining all venture fraud cases, we find that fraud is more likely in startups with stronger founder control rights, more convex founder cash flow rights, more investors, and greater participation of non-traditional investors. Founder-controlled boards are 88% more likely to commit fraud than VC-controlled or shared-control boards, even within the same firm. Governance variables matter much more than founder characteristics in predicting fraud. Hot funding conditions at the initial round, which weaken governance incentives, predict future fraud. Fraudulent entrepreneurs continue to found new VC-backed startups unharmed relative to non-fraudulent entrepreneurs, suggesting a lack of market discipline. Overall, our results highlight rising agency costs in VC-backed firms that could lead to misallocation and broader social costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The positive correlation between high temperatures and crime is well established. I consider how random, within-month daily high temperature and precipitation affects arrests rather than incidents. I analyze jail records of a Prohibition Era southern city with mean summer daily high temperatures of 85�F without modern air conditioning, so outdoor temperatures are salient. I find that each 1�F increase in daily high temperatures leads to a 0.5% to 1.9% increase in all-offense arrests, with the largest effect on violence. I also find that severe droughts have no meaningful effect on violent or public order offenses but lead to a 17.2% increase in the daily number of arrests for fraud, forgery, and related offenses. The results are consistent with a hypothesis that more arrests occur on hot days because more crimes are committed on hot days. The results are also consistent with studies that identify a connection between droughts and crime in modern developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern smartphones present new threats to road safety beyond talking and texting, but the real-world effects are difficult to study. One way to causally assess the impact of smartphones on road safety is to identify arbitrarily timed events during which smartphone-related distraction may exogenously increase – i.e., a situation that relies not on plausibly random variation in who uses smartphones while driving, but when smartphones are used.  We investigated the impact of smartphones on road safety by examining traffic fatalities on days when smartphone use likely surges: the release of major music albums. Using event study analysis, we show that music streaming – an indicator for smartphone use, where streaming most often occurs – sharply increases, by nearly 40%, on dates of major music album releases, while U.S. traffic fatalities increase by nearly 15% on those same days. Mobile device use while driving is a known safety issue, but today’s smartphones present new and greater opportunities for driver distraction. Our study indicates how features of these phones may have important impacts on distracted driving and traffic fatalities.</content>

    <title>What Drives Money Competition: Comparative Advantage in Payments versus Reserves</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study competition between monies that provide separate payment and non-payment (e.g., store-of-value) functions. Our central insight is that payment adoption is governed not by absolute payment superiority, but by comparative advantage between payment and non-payment roles. A money that is “too good” as a store of value may circulate less as a payment instrument, even if it is technologically superior, because agents prefer to hoard it rather than spend it. The model delivers equilibria in which monies either specialize into distinct roles or coexist as payment instruments with one emerging as dominant. These mechanisms provide a unified microfoundation for classic monetary phenomena such as Gresham’s law and the big problem of small change, and offer a new perspective on modern debates over stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Contrary to the common view that interest-bearing digital currencies necessarily threaten bank deposits, we show that higher yields can weaken payment adoption by raising the opportunity cost of spending. As a result, traditional bank deposits may coexist with, and even retain dominance over, technologically superior digital alternatives.</content>

    <title>Valuation of Regulatory Risk on Pharmaceutical R&amp;D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geopolitical tensions, supply-chain concerns and policy risk have moved to the forefront of the pharmaceutical industry. This paper develops a real options valuation model of drug R&amp;D that captures sequential clinical investment with technical failure, stochastic costs, uncertain cash flows, and optimal abandonment. We incorporate two regulatory shocks: a reduction in effective exclusivity period and a price-control shock that reduces net cash flows. Calibrating to an incremental CNS program, we find that project value at initiation is highly right-skewed: the mean is USD 69.6m but the median is negative, so expected value is driven by rare high-upside outcomes. Regulatory risk mainly compresses this upside. Both reductions in effective exclusivity and price-based interventions substantially weaken investment incentives, even when they occur with moderate probability. Value is strongly convex in exclusivity length, with the final years carrying the highest marginal value. We introduce iso-value maps that summarize how time-based and price-based policies substitute in their impact on project valuation, to clarify the trade-offs inherent in regulatory design: losing two years of exclusivity is comparable to roughly a 30% cash-flow contraction. Using a standard revenue-to-R&amp;D elasticity, these valuation effects imply a 10% to 25% long-run contraction in investment. The framework provides a transparent mapping from policy design to project value and investment incentives.</content>

    <title>Expanding Paternity Leave: Effects on Beliefs, Norms, and Gender Gaps</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether policy can shift gendered beliefs, norms, and labor market outcomes by exploiting a major expansion of earmarked paternity leave in Denmark. The reform generated large first-stage effects, substantially reallocating leave from mothers to fathers. Using a regression discontinuity design combined with new survey data linked to administrative records, we show that the reform makes parents more supportive of paternity leave, shifts gender-role beliefs in a progressive direction, and reduces perceived differences in childcare ability. The reform also narrows gender gaps in earnings and hours worked. The earnings gap falls by 33pp in the first year following childbirth (during leave) and by 2.8pp in the second year (after leave). These results demonstrate that policy can meaningfully influence beliefs, norms, and gender inequality. On the other hand, earmarking restricts families’ ability to allocate leave freely and lowers leave satisfaction, highlighting a central trade-off inherent in paternalistic policies.</content>

    <title>Machine Learning Meets Markowitz</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The standard approach to portfolio selection involves two stages: forecast the asset returns and then plug them into an optimizer. We argue that this separation is deeply problematic. The first stage treats cross-sectional prediction errors as equally important across all securities.  However, given that final portfolios might differ given distinct risk preferences and investment restrictions, the standard approach fails to recognize that the investor is not just concerned with the average forecast error - but the precision of the forecasts for the specific assets that are most important for their portfolio.  Hence, it is crucial to integrate the two stages. We propose a novel implementation utilizing machine learning tools that unifies the expected return generation process and the final optimized portfolio. Our empirical example provides convincing evidence that our end-to-end method outperforms the traditional two-stage approach.  In our framework, each investor has their own, endogenously determined, efficient frontier that depends on risk preferences, investor-specific constraints, as well as exposure to market frictions.</content>

    <title>Disparate Impacts of Teacher Certification Exams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use Texas administrative data to assess the long-standing claim that teacher certification exams discriminate against underrepresented minority (URM) candidates. In a regression discontinuity design, we find that failing a certification exam delays entry into teaching and costs the average candidate $10,000 in forgone earnings. These costs fall disproportionately on URM candidates both because they are more likely to fail and because their earnings losses from failing are 50 percent larger on average. To examine whether these disparities are justified by racial/ethnic differences in teaching quality, we develop a new measure of disparate impact and estimate it using a policy change that increased the difficulty of Texas' elementary certification exam. The harder exam reduced the URM share of new teachers but had no significant benefits for teaching quality or student achievement. Taken together, our findings show that certification exams have a disparate impact in the sense that they impose much larger economic costs on URM teaching candidates than on white candidates with similar potential teaching quality.</content>

    <title>Chaining Tasks, Redefining Work: A Theory of AI Automation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Production is a sequence of steps that can be executed (1) manually, (2) augmented with AI, or (3) fully automated within contiguous AI-executed steps called “chains.” Firms optimally bundle steps into tasks and then jobs, trading off specialization gains against coordination costs. We characterize the optimal assignment of humans and AI to steps and the firm’s resulting job structure, showing that comparative advantage logic can fail with AI chaining. The model implies non-linear productivity gains from AI quality improvements and admits a CES representation at the macro level. Empirical evidence supports the model’s key predictions that (1) AI-executed steps co-occur in chains, (2) dispersion of AI-exposed steps lowers AI execution at the job level, and (3) adjacency to AI-executed steps increases the likelihood that a step is AI-executed.</content>

    <title>The Promise of Microbial Fertilizer for Affordable and Sustainable Food Production in Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Food insecurity is an existential threat for Africa (a continent facing rapid population growth and dire climate impacts) and addressing it a global imperative. Over 30% of caloric intake comes from maize, but crop yields are low partly because high costs make synthetic fertilizers uneconomical. A field experiment with Kenyan smallholder farmers explores the promise of genetically modified (microbial) biofertilizers to deliver nitrogen and increase yields at affordable costs. We see significant increases in yields (up to 110% for some farmers) and lower environmental impact than synthetic products. This suggests that biofertilizers could dramatically improve food security and child nutrition in Africa.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines Black immigrant occupational integration. We create an Index of Revealed Advantage in Migration, which captures international differences in selectivity. Except for Caribbean-English and Other Immigrants, first generation Black immigrants have lower occupational achievement than native-born Non-Hispanic African Americans, that is, “Native born Blacks.” However, second generation Black immigrants have greater occupational achievement Native born Blacks. Except for Caribbean-English and Other Immigrants, first generation Black immigrants have lower occupational achievement than native-born Non-Hispanic white-only Americans that is, “Native born Whites.” Second generation Africans have statistically identical occupational achievement with Native born Whites; otherwise, each group of second generation Black immigrants has lower occupational achievement Native born Whites.</content>

    <title>Great Expectations: Responses to Current and Future Transfers for Low-Income Individuals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the expectation of aid change behavior? We propose a simple approach to separate expectations effects from the direct effects of relaxing resource constraints: compare the promise of a program to the program itself. We test this approach in a four-arm randomized controlled trial of cash transfers in Uganda. Both those who received cash and those promised-to-receive cash increase their labor supply and investment. Immediate transfers also increase household expenditures and savings. Our results are not consistent with standard life-cycle models; they are better explained by a model in which the transfer increases individual labor productivity.</content>

    <title>Government Funding and the Direction of Academic Energy Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does government funding influence the choice of research topics? Novel grant-making modalities such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) program aim to encourage scientists to take on difficult-to-solve, wicked societal problems such as clean energy. Yet little causal evidence exists linking funding and research direction, with most existing studies focusing on health sciences. We provide new evidence on the effect of funding on clean energy research, addressing two questions: (1) Do scientists change the focus of their research in response to targeted government funding opportunities? (2) If so, what types of calls for funding best attract new researchers? Using data on grants from the Department of Energy and National Science Foundation, we combine text and regression analyses to compare the publication trajectories of funded scientists to a set of matched controls. After funding, the research of funded scientists becomes more similar to the grant topic than that of the matched controls. The effect is largest for ARPA-E, which explicitly aims to attract new scientists to clean energy research, suggesting that agency efforts to attract new researchers to a topic area can succeed. General calls for funding such as offered by traditional NSF directorates generate less movement.</content>
