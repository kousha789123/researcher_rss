    <title>Prescription for Disaster: The SSDI Rate, Pain, and Prescribing Practices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A county’s fraction of adults in 1990 on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a strong predictor of growth in local drug death rates after 2000.  The part of the SSDI rate related to drug deaths is not proxying for well-known contributors to the drug crisis, e.g. OxyContin.  Instead, it appears to capture the fraction of people in chronic pain.  We show that in the late 1990s, physicians began prescribing opioids more aggressively to treat pain. Taken together, our estimates suggest that drug deaths rates would be 43% lower in 2015 had prescribing practices stayed at 1995 levels.</content>

    <title>Inferring Fine-grained Migration Patterns across the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fine-grained migration data illuminate important demographic, environmental, and health phenomena. However, migration datasets within the United States remain lacking: publicly available Census data are neither spatially nor temporally granular, and proprietary data have higher resolution but demographic and other biases. To address these limitations, we develop a scalable iterative-proportional-fitting based method that reconciles high-resolution but biased proprietary data with low-resolution but more reliable Census data. We apply this method to produce MIGRATE, a dataset of annual migration matrices from 2010-2019 that captures flows between 47.4 billion pairs of Census Block Groups — about four thousand times more granular than publicly available data. These estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets, and improve accuracy and reduce bias relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze both national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document temporal and demographic variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance: for example, we find that people are increasingly likely to move to top-income-quartile CBGs and identify racial disparities in upward mobility. We also show that MIGRATE can illuminate important local migration patterns, including out-migration in response to California wildfires, that are invisible in coarser previous datasets. We publicly release MIGRATE to provide a resource for migration research in the social, environmental, and health sciences.</content>

    <title>Why Is Manufacturing Productivity Growth So Low?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the recent slow growth in manufacturing productivity. We show that nearly all measured TFP growth since 1987—and its post-2000s decline—comes from a few computer-related industries. We argue conventional measures understate manufacturing productivity growth by failing to fully capture quality improvements. We compare consumer to producer and import price indices. In rapidly changing industries, consumer price indices indicate less inflation, suggesting mismeasurement in standard industry deflators. Using an input-output framework, we estimate that TFP growth is understated by 1.7 percentage points in durable manufacturing and 0.4 percentage points in nondurable manufacturing, with no mismeasurement in nonmanufacturing industries.</content>

    <title>From Kin to Creed: Missions and the Reconfiguration of Social and Moral Order in Colonial Congo</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Augustin Bergeron</name>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how colonial religious institutions reshaped traditional social structures in Africa. Focusing on the Congo, I examine the long-term effects of Christian missions that sought to replace kin-based authority with European-Christian notions of social and moral order. I combine newly digitized data on historical mission locations with an original survey of 975 respondents, measuring attitudes toward family and coethnics, social network composition, referral behavior in a job experiment, and moral values. To address concerns about endogenous mission placement, I construct two counterfactuals: missions that were initially established but later abandoned, and simulated locations that were historically suitable but never selected. I find that exposure to missions persistently reduced bias toward kin and coethnics and weakened the role of kinship ties in networks and referrals. It also eroded communal moral values, such as loyalty to one's group and deference to authority, without a corresponding rise in universal moral principles. Instead, these shifts reflect a redirection of identity and moral obligation from kinship and ethnicity toward religious affiliation. Historical records on mission personnel and infrastructure point to religious instruction and education as key transmission channels. Together, the findings suggest that colonial religious institutions profoundly reshaped the social and moral organization of colonized societies.</content>

    <title>Congestion Pricing, Carpooling, and Commuter Welfare</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on the canonical "bottleneck" model of Vickrey (1969), we show that carpooling and road pricing are highly complementary in addressing traffic congestion: they can be much more effective jointly than each one separately, and can improve commuter welfare without having to rely on the redistribution of government revenue. By contrast, technological advances that make time in traffic more comfortable or productive (e.g., self-driving cars), implemented without additional economic incentives, may result in zero improvement in social welfare.</content>

    <title>Test-Optional College Admissions: ACT and SAT Scores, Applications, and Enrollment Changes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses data from the largest college application platform in the U.S. to describe application and enrollment changes in response to widespread test-optional admissions adoption between 2018-2021. Although test-optional policies aimed to expand college access, underrepresented students did not apply to Elite colleges at higher rates and Elite colleges still received large numbers of high-scoring applications after tests became optional. Despite the oversupply of high-scoring applicants in the test-optional period, Elite colleges enrolled more lower-scorers with high grades, in particular first-generation and lower-income students. Enrollment in less selective colleges also increased among high-scorers, so test-optional policies may exacerbate undermatching.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence in Team Dynamics: Who Gets Replaced and Why?</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Xienan Cheng, Mustafa Dogan &amp; Pinar Yildirim</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in organizations. We ask: (1) How should a principal optimally deploy limited AI resources to replace workers in a team? (2) In a sequential workflow, which workers face the highest risk of AI replacement? (3) How does substitution with AI affect both the replaced and non-replaced workers’ wages? We develop a sequential team production model in which a principal can use peer monitoring—where each worker observes the effort of their predecessor—to discipline team members. The principal may replace some workers with AI agents, whose actions are not subject to moral hazard. Our analysis yields four key results. First, the optimal AI strategy stochastically replaces workers rather than fixating on a single position. Second, the principal replaces workers at the beginning and at the end of the workflow, but does not replace the middle worker, since this worker is crucial for sustaining the flow of information obtained by peer monitoring. Third, the principal may optimally underutilize available AI capacity. Fourth, the optimal AI adoption increases average wages and reduces intra-team wage inequality.</content>

    <title>Scale Economies, Input-Output Loops, and Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the equilibrium and welfare implications of quantitative trade models with sector-level external economies of scale (EES). While empirical evidence highlights the importance of EES, prior work has examined their effects only in models without input-output linkages. Focusing on a small open economy, we derive an intuitive condition for equilibrium uniqueness that links trade elasticities, scale elasticities, and input-output coefficients. We further show that this same condition guarantees positive gains from trade, regardless of a country’s pattern of specialization.</content>

    <title>Monetary-Fiscal Interactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inflation surged in 2021-2023 from a classic fiscal shock: money and debt that financed huge spending, without a plan for repayment. Neither money nor supply shocks offer a coherent alternative explanation. Inflation eased, with no recession, once the fiscal shock was over. Higher interest rates could have brought inflation down earlier, but could not have stopped it. Going forward, higher interest rates will raise debt service costs, and thus perversely raise inflation unless fiscal policy can tighten. High debt and structural deficits also mean that the US may lose the fiscal space to borrow in the next crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As we approach Transformative Artificial Intelligence (TAI), there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of how it could reshape our economic models, institutions and policies. We propose a research agenda for the economics of TAI by identifying nine Grand Challenges: economic growth, innovation, income distribution, decision-making power, geoeconomics, information flows, safety risks, human well-being, and transition dynamics. By accelerating work in these areas, researchers can develop insights and tools to help fulfill the economic potential of TAI.</content>

    <title>Climate Risk Exposure and Firms’ Climate Strategies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When exposed to greater physical and transition climate risks, are firms more likely to engage in climate mitigation, climate adaptation, or/and political strategies? This study examines this question and finds that firms exposed to greater physical and transition climate risks are less likely to undertake substantial mitigation efforts. Instead, they pursue other strategies. Specifically, firms exposed to greater physical climate risks are more inclined to pursue adaptation strategies, while firms facing higher transition climate risks are more likely to engage in anti-climate political strategies (such as lobbying against climate policies). The intensity of how firms manage their climate risks is influenced by their time horizon: the more myopic they are, the less they engage in climate mitigation and the more they oppose climate-friendly policies, thereby decreasing transition risks today while worsening their exposure to future physical and transition climate risks. Overall, this study provides insights into the (lack of) preparedness of the corporate sector for heightened climate risks.</content>

    <title>Asset Elasticities and Currency Risk Transfer</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use administrative security-level data from the U.S. and Euro Area (EA) portfolios to estimate asset demand and supply elasticities by exploiting exogenous variation in bond-specific currency wedges. Employing a Bartik-style shift-share identification approach, we document extensive heterogeneity in investor demand responsiveness to exogenous changes in the price of currency risk, conditional on the issuer characteristics. Demand for AE-bonds is always inelastic, whereas for EM-bonds, elasticity depends on investor type and currency: insurance/pension, nonbanks and banks have finite-elastic demand for EM-bonds that are issued in their own (investor) currency. For EM-issuer-currency bonds, only EA non-bank investors increase the share of these bonds in their portfolio when currency wedges widen, suggesting they accept higher currency risk for higher returns. In response, issuers adjust their supply endogenously: an exogenous increase of 8 basis point in currency wedges leads to a 0.26% decline in local currency bond issuance relative to GDP. We develop a theoretical framework where debt issuance decisions take into account heterogenous demand of investors in terms of their response to changes in the price of currency risk.</content>

    <title>Permanent Capital Losses after Banking Crises</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the mechanisms driving bank losses across historical banking crises in 46 economies and the effectiveness of policy interventions in restoring bank capitalization. We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations. Early liquidity interventions can avert banking crises, but only under specific conditions. Once large bank equity declines have occurred, policy responses have historically failed to prevent persistent undercapitalization in the banking sector.</content>

    <title>A Study of the Microdynamics of Early Childhood Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the weekly evolution of child skills as measured by unique data from a widely-emulated early childhood home-visiting program developed in Jamaica, adapted to rural China, and applied in different versions worldwide. The design of the study avoids problems of endogeneity of inputs and lack of truly comparable measures of skills across children that plague previous econometric studies of child development. Skills that are nominally classified as the same, in fact, do not appear to share a common unit scale across levels. They are produced by skill-specific, lifecycle-stage-specific technologies. We formulate and estimate a new dynamic stochastic skill production model for multiple skills that is consistent with the evidence. We quantify the dynamics of early life learning. The model explains the “fadeout” of measures of learning by the emergence of new skills not properly measured. We investigate the role of ability in learning. We find important differences in learning patterns between boys and girls.</content>

    <title>Maternity Leave Extensions and Gender Gaps: Evidence from an Online Job Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the unintended consequences of maternity leave extension on gender gaps in the labor market. Using millions of job applications on an online job platform and the staggered extension of maternity leave across Chinese provinces, we find that an average increase (22%) in the length of paid maternity leave led to a 3.7 percentage point decrease in positive callbacks to female applicants relative to their male counterparts. In response, female job seekers submitted 4.4 more job applications, shifted toward jobs with 5.4% lower wages, and experienced 0.9 weeks longer job search duration than male applicants. We also find that government subsidies that partially cover firms' wage costs of extended maternity leave help alleviate its adverse impact on gender disparities in hiring.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the impact of perceived cancer risk on housing values using widely advertised national reclassifications of chemical carcinogenicity in the United States. Combining these information events with an empirical design that compares changes in house values closer to affected toxic plants against those farther away isolates the effect of cancer risk news from other local factors. Focusing on plants previously emitting reclassified carcinogenic chemicals, we estimate a 1-2% decline in housing values within a 3-mile radius compared to those located farther away. The effects are stronger in areas with higher media presence underscoring the role of salience as a mechanism.</content>

    <title>Price and Volume Divergence in China’s Real Estate Markets: The Role of Local Governments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2022), Chinese cities witnessed a paradox: residential land and new house prices surged while transaction volumes plummeted. We attribute this to local governments’ active price management through supply controls, land acquisitions by Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs), and limits on new home sales permits. Cities more dependent on land sales and land-backed debt before the pandemic experienced greater price increases and price-volume divergence, with LGFVs buying more land at higher prices than other buyers. These interventions helped sustain fiscal financing but deepened developers’ financial distress, revealing unintended consequences of local governments’ fiscal strategies during downturns.</content>

    <title>Playing with Blocs: Quantifying Decoupling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We adopt a data-driven approach to measure trade fragmentation over the period 2015-2023. Countries are classified into three groups according to changes in their trade costs with the US and China: those shifting toward the US bloc, those shifting toward the China bloc, and those with no change in alignment. Roughly one-quarter of countries moved toward each bloc, while about half showed no realignment. We document that while cross-bloc trade costs rose, they were accompanied by falling within-bloc trade costs. We use a quantitative model to compute the real income effects of this reconfiguration of the global trade costs. The median country in the world, and the median country within each bloc, has 0.4-0.6% higher real income as a result of the observed decoupling, contrary to the widespread belief that fragmentation has been welfare-reducing. Finally, we find a modest amount of bloc misalignment: the median country moving to the US bloc would actually be better off moving to the China bloc, and vice versa. These results suggest that trade decoupling does not always follow trade-driven economic interests.</content>

    <title>Who’s Afraid of Tariffs? The Geographic Distribution of Fear and Loss</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On April 2nd 2025, after markets closed, the United States announced steep “Liberation Day” tariffs against most of its trading partners, many of which announced retaliatory tariffs. Market uncertainty spiked, consistent with the magnitudes and scope of the tariffs being unexpected. The prospect of a global trade war sent US stock markets down over ten percent until the US “paused” its tariffs on April 9th 2025, whereupon markets recovered. Portfolios of the stocks of firms headquartered in “redder” (more Republicans per Democrat) counties lost more value during this window.</content>

    <title>The Traffic Noise Externality: Costs, Incidence and Policy Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than 42 million Americans are exposed to medium or high levels of traffic noise. Despite its potentially large toll and unequal distribution, the economic costs, incidence, and policy implications of traffic noise have received limited attention in economics. We quantify the aggregate economic burden of this externality and its distribution across demographic groups by estimating homebuyers' willingness to pay for quieter environments. Using  quasi-experimental variation from the construction of noise barriers, we find that reduced traffic noise exposure leads to significant increases in house prices, implying that buyers are willing to pay a substantial premium for each decibel of noise reduction. In the five years before construction, we detect no differential pre-trends in prices between treated and control properties. Following construction, we observe an immediate and largely permanent 6.8% increase in prices within 100 meters, with smaller gains at greater distances. Information on each barrier's noise attenuation allows us to recover the willingness to pay per decibel of traffic noise. We calculate the aggregate economic cost of traffic noise at $110 billion nationwide. The economic burden is disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households, suggesting that the externality is regressive. The cost varies widely across cities, reflecting differences in noise levels, property values and population density. Based on our estimates, the socially efficient Pigouvian tax amounts to $974 per vehicle. A broad shift to electric vehicles -- which are  quieter than traditional vehicles -- could yield noise reduction benefits of $77.3 billion, concentrated among low-income families in dense urban areas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We review the economic literature on self-image, which conceptualizes identity as a set of beliefs about one’s core traits, values, goals, and social ties. Self-image concerns lead individuals to process information and make choices in non-standard ways that help affirm and protect certain valued identities. We first present the main cognitive mechanisms involved within a simple unifying framework. We then survey the extensive laboratory, online, and field experimental literature on the nature and behavioral implications of self-image concerns. We discuss in particular how they give rise to information and decision avoidance, motivated memory and beliefs, excuse-driven behavior, preferences for truth-telling, hypothetical bias, moral cleansing and moral licensing, collective identities, political preferences, and other forms of self-signaling or self-deception. We subsequently discuss common empirical strategies used to identify self-image concerns, as well as the threats to their validity and how to alleviate them. We conclude by outlining open questions and directions for future research on the belief-based approach to identity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge spillovers among firms are widely viewed as a key driver of agglomeration and growth, but are difficult to estimate cleanly. We randomly allocated an energy-efficient motor --- a “servo'” motor --- among leather-goods firms in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and tracked adoption, information flows, beliefs about energy savings, and other variables. We use the difference between actual exposure and expected exposure (from simulated randomization draws) to identify the effect of exposure. We find a robust positive effect of exposure to treated neighbors within a small geographic area (500 meters in our baseline specification) on information flows and adoption. A marginal value of public funds (MVPF) calculation taking learning spillovers into account yields a significantly larger value than one considering only treated firms and suggests that adoption subsidies would be a cost-effective policy intervention.</content>

    <title>Improving Judicial Protection in Intimate Partner Violence Cases: The Role of Specialized Courts and Judges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the large-scale implementation of a system of specialized domestic violence courts (SDVCs), an innovation in access to justice programs for potential victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) and offenders. Using individual-level administrative data from the universe of civil domestic violence cases in Puerto Rico during the period 2014-2020, we leverage the staggered opening of SDVCs across judicial regions to examine the consequences for victims’ judicial protection and offender recidivism. Access to SDVCs leads to a considerable 8 percentage points increase in the probability that judges issue a protection order and a 1.7 percentage point (15 percent) decrease in victim and offender reappearance rates within one year of the start of the case. Effects are more pronounced for cases in which parties have children in common and in which access to SDVCs is more limited. Linking the case data to administrative and survey data on judges, we show that the priorities of judges assigned to SDVCs play a prominent role in explaining these outcomes.</content>

    <title>Assessing Career Attainment via a Non-Wage Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a non-pecuniary measure of career achievement, seniority. Based on a database of over 150 million resumes, this metric exploits the variation in how long it takes workers to attain job titles. A person’s seniority is defined as the number of years it takes the median individual—within the same industry and firm size category—to achieve that person’s job title. Seniority aligns with standard markers of success—it is positively correlated with both wages and educational attainment. To demonstrate its value as a measure of career progression, we show that individuals with higher seniority levels in the public sector are more likely to transition to higher-paying positions in the private sector. When non-monetary factors influence career choice, evaluating labor market outcomes using non-wage measures, such as seniority, offers significant advantages.</content>

    <title>A Nascent International Financial Channel of China’s Monetary Policy Transmission</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chinese private portfolio equity outflows, though small compared to other Chinese outflows, are growing rapidly because of capital account liberalization and capital flight. Using granular stock-holding data on Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) mutual funds, we identify a nascent financial channel of international transmission of Chinese monetary policy to world stocks. Event study analysis around monetary policy announcement days reveals that monetary policy tightening depresses returns of country equity indexes and individual U.S. stocks with QDII fund exposure relative to non-exposed stocks. The results are robust to controlling for the real transmission channel of Chinese monetary policy and other confounders. The effect is driven by smaller and less liquid firms, but not by China-concept stocks or those highly exposed to China's macroeconomic shocks. We also find that the results are driven by household portfolio rebalancing from more to less risky assets following the announcement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the optimal allocation of population and consumption in a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model with frictional migration, where households' idiosyncratic location preference shocks are private information. We derive a recursive formula for the constrained-efficient allocation, capturing the trade-off between consumption smoothing and efficient migration. In a quantitative model calibrated to the US economy featuring both cross-state migration and risk-free savings, we find that the constrained-efficient allocation features lower population but higher average consumption in less productive states than the status quo, achieving efficiency and spatial redistribution simultaneously through dynamic incentives. In response to local negative productivity shocks, the constrained-efficient allocation features more front-loaded consumption than the status quo, with systematic heterogeneity linked to the location’s pre-shock fundamentals.</content>

    <title>Equity Frictions and Firm Ownership</title>

    <author>
      <name>Alessandra Peter</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, I document systematic heterogeneity in ownership and financing of firms across Eurozone countries. To rationalize these differences, I build a quantitative general equilibrium model of workers and entrepreneurs who choose debt and equity financing of their firms, subject to rich country-specific financial frictions. The novel data on firm ownership and financing, combined with the structure of the model, allows me to quantify the level of debt and equity frictions in each country. Quantitatively, I find much larger output effects from equity frictions: harmonizing them across countries would lead to nearly four times larger output effects compared to debt frictions, and removing them would increase aggregate output by 75\% more. The larger impact on output is due not only to the estimated levels and dispersion of equity frictions, but also to the fact that equity provides greater risk sharing, which further incentivizes entrepreneurs to expand their firms. Through their effect on risk sharing, equity frictions also rationalize the observed negative relationship between equity financing and wealth inequality. Quantitatively, they are responsible for over 70\% of the explained variation in top wealth shares across countries.</content>

    <title>Türkiye's Homemade Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Türkiye's response to post-pandemic inflation is a cautionary tale of how political pressure for low interest rates can create macroeconomic instabilities. While central banks worldwide raised interest rates to combat inflation in 2021-2023, Turkish authorities pursued the opposite strategy: cutting real rates to deeply negative levels while implementing financial engineering tools, FX interventions, and financial repression to stabilize markets. The centerpiece was a novel FX-protected deposit scheme (KKM) that guaranteed depositors against currency depreciation, shifting exchange rate risk to the government balance sheet. We provide a detailed account of this policy experiment and develop a theoretical model focusing on how KKM functions and creates vulnerabilities. Our model reveals that pressure to keep interest rates below inflation-targeting levels can lead to an interconnected destabilizing sequence. Low rates generate inflation, current account deficits, and exchange rate depreciation. KKM provides partial stabilization by effectively raising rates for savers while maintaining low rates for borrowers. However, this creates growing contingent fiscal burdens and vulnerability to self-fulfilling currency and sovereign debt crises. This explains additional policies adopted including capital flow management, financial repression, and return to orthodox monetary policy. As central banks worldwide face renewed pressure to set lower policy rates, Türkiye's experience illustrates the consequences.</content>

    <title>Nature and Biodiversity Loss: A Research Agenda for Financial Economics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We outline a research agenda to better understand the economic and financial consequences of nature and biodiversity loss. Our starting point is a simple model in which ecosystem services—such as pollination, water filtration, and carbon sequestration—enter economic production, and where nature degradation and climate change reinforce one another through a “Twin-Crises Multiplier.” We then extend this framework to allow for heterogeneity across firms, industries, and geographies in how they depend on, and in turn affect, nature. This broader perspective provides a foundation for empirical analyses of how biodiversity loss influences aggregate output, firm productivity, and financial risk. We conclude by identifying opportunities for asset pricing and corporate finance research to systematically incorporate nature and biodiversity into financial economics.</content>

    <title>How Credible is Hong Kong's Currency Peg?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an asset-pricing model to evaluate the credibility of Hong Kong’s Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). Allowing for imperfect peg credibility, we derive closed-form solutions for exchange rates and option prices under potential regime shifts. Using HKD option data, we estimate market-implied probabilities of peg survival and the fundamental value of the HKD. Our results show that credibility fluctuates with U.S. interest rate hikes, local liquidity conditions, and Chinese currency dynamics. Compared with more standard Black-Scholes-based models, our approach provides more realistic assessments of peg sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study monotone ecological inference, a partial identification approach to ecological inference. The approach exploits information about one or both of the following conditional associations: (1) outcome differences between groups within the same neighborhood, and (2) outcomes differences within the same group across neighborhoods with different group compositions. We show how assumptions about the sign of these conditional associations, whether individually or in relation to one another, can yield informative sharp bounds in ecological inference settings. We illustrate our proposed approach using county-level data to study differences in Covid-19 vaccination rates among Republicans and Democrats in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When women plan for life after childbirth, they form beliefs about work, childcare, and how their careers will unfold. These expectations shape key decisions but are formed under deep uncertainty. We use a 2019 state-contingent survey of 11,000 Danish women linked to administrative data to compare pre-birth beliefs to realized outcomes. Mothers accurately anticipate their eventual return to work but underestimate the duration of the career interruption. This miscalibration stems from two belief errors—about partner leave and own labor supply—which interact and persist even among second-time mothers, with implications for labor supply, planning, and policy design.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a general-equilibrium model in which the safety of a country's currency and the choice of its exchange-rate regime arise endogenously. Calibrated to pre-2025 data, the model replicates the U.S. dollar’s safety premium, low Treasury yields, and its status as the world's anchor currency. Introducing a trade war that isolates U.S. goods markets from the world erodes the U.S. dollar's safety premium, raises U.S. interest rates, and lowers the world market value of U.S. firms. For sufficiently high tariffs, small economies optimally re-peg to the euro, precipitating a phase shift to a euro-centric international monetary system and a global welfare loss. The analysis implies that persistent trade wars may threaten the financial privileges the United States derives from the dollar’s international role.</content>

    <title>Aggregating Average Treatment Effects on the Treated in Difference-in-Differences Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For difference-in-differences methods, there has been great attention to obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects, especially when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. However, there has been little discussion of the importance of weights in aggregating those treatment effects into an overall average treatment effect on the treated. There are many possible ways to aggregate estimated cohort-time treatment effects. We show that the standard software used to estimate Callaway and Sant’Anna’s method uses weights that are not just the number of treated observations in treated years. Instead, the software uses weights that include the number of observations in the reference pre-period instead of only the number of observations in the treated periods. We discuss why the aggregation weights matter and under what circumstances the weights make the most difference.</content>

    <title>Financial Value of Nature: Coastal Housing Markets, Mangroves, and Climate Resilience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measuring the financial value of nature is difficult, often resulting in insufficient funding directed to nature conservation and restoration.  As coastal risks increase from development and climate change, a tangible benefit of nature is the protection it offers against storm damages.  Many studies from the risk industry and others assess the direct effects of wetlands for reducing damage during storms. However, the value of wetlands for coastal protection could extend to many other benefits, including home prices in areas where storms are common.  We use property-level housing transaction data from Zillow and show that proximity to mangroves in Florida moderates home price decline and dispersion following major hurricanes. The effects are substantial in magnitude, reducing the probability of losing a quarter or more of housing value by 2-7 percentage points, which corresponds to 20-40-thousand-dollar value for a million-dollar property, conditional on a hurricane.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI is transforming production, consumption, and work, yet current statistical frameworks would likely struggle to capture its economic full economic impact. While the 2025 System of National Accounts introduces AI as a distinct asset, challenges remain in valuing AI-related investments, inputs, and outputs. Moreover, as a general-purpose technology, AI alters business processes, service quality, and labor organization in ways poorly reflected in official data. This paper outlines key measurement gaps from transformative AI, including the tracking cross-border inputs, quality change, and process changes. We argue that economic statistics should adopt more granular, task-based, and outcome-focused approaches to ensure relevance in an increasingly AI-driven economy.</content>

    <title>“No One Can Borrow” – Reassessing the “Junior Can’t Borrow” Equity-Premium Puzzle Resolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Junior Can’t Borrow,” Constantinides, Donaldson, and Mehra’s (CDM) three-period exchange model, eliminates borrowing by the young, and, consequently, all generations to resolve the equity premium puzzle. This paper examines CDM’s resolution in an 80-period, OLG model with capital, fiscal policy, macro shocks and steeply rising borrowing costs. Imposing such costs on all generations and, thereby, eliminating the bond market produces, as in CDM, a large premium. But permitting even one generation to sell bonds without transactions costs dramatically raises the safe rate, restoring the puzzle. Hence, “No One Can Borrow” not “Junior Can’t Borrow” is CDM’s real message. Since zero or low marginal-cost borrowing is commonplace – be it via secured borrowing or friends and family loans, CDM’s “solution” isn’t plausible. As in representative-agent RBCs, macro risk is low in OLG-RBCs – not because aggregate shocks are small, but because they can be hedged via self-insurance (saving) and largely average out over agents’ lifetimes. Indeed, absent high marginal borrowing costs, agents, even older ones, are close to indifferent between holding shares and holding bonds, rendering their net bond demand (supply) curves highly elastic. This explains why even a single generation is willing to supply significant amounts of bonds at a low price (high yield).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide new evidence on earnings gaps between non-Hispanic White and three generations of Black workers in the United States during 1995-2024, using nationally representative data. Results reveal remarkable earnings advances among 2nd-generation Black immigrants, opposite to the well-documented widening in overall Black-White earnings gap. Among women, 2nd-generation Black workers have earnings higher than or equal to White women; among men, they earn 10% less at the median, but the gap vanishes at the top decile. The gap for 1st-generation Black men is shrinking, halving at the top decile; for 1st-generation Black women it shows initial widening then shrinking at the median. The native Black-White gap remains stubbornly high. Educational attainment largely drives 2nd-generation success, while residential patterns play a protective role for the 1st and 2nd generations. These findings provide critical data to set the record straight on the accomplishments of the highly successful and rising demography of Black immigrants and their US-born children.</content>

    <title>Policy Options to Achieve US Sustainable Aviation Fuel Targets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decarbonizing aviation in the short term will likely entail replacing large quantities of petroleum jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), which are predominantly biofuels. In the United States, biofuels are currently used as substitutes for gasoline and diesel in road transportation and are supported by a complex set of federal and state policies including the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), state low carbon fuel standards, and state and federal tax credits. Policies promoting SAF therefore interact with surface transport biofuel policies. In this paper, we use a new detailed partial equilibrium model of road and air transportation fuel markets to compare various policy options designed to achieve a target of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030. Our results suggest that the target is attainable with current technology but not with current policy. Several potential federal policies, including modifications to the existing RFS, a federal SAF tax credit, or a clean aviation standard could meet the 3 billion gallon target with similar emissions reductions and costs but different incidence. The lowest cost policy we study entails replacing all current biofuels policies with a modest carbon tax on fossil transportation fuels paired with a SAF tax credit.</content>

    <title>Human Capital Accumulation Across Space</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how human capital shapes the economic geography of development. We develop a model in which the cost of acquiring human capital varies across space, and regions with higher human capital innovate more. Locations are spatially connected through migration and trade. There are localized agglomeration economies, and human-capital-augmenting technology diffuses across space. Using high-resolution data on income and schooling, we quantify and simulate the model at the 1° x 1° resolution for the entire globe. Over the span of two centuries, the model predicts strong persistence in the spatial distribution of development — unlike spatial dynamic models without human capital, which predict convergence. Proportionally lowering the cost of education in sub-Saharan Africa or Central and South Asia raises local outcomes but reduces global welfare, whereas the same policy in Latin America improves global outcomes. An alternative policy equalizing educational costs across sub-Saharan Africa generates relatively worse outcomes, as population reallocates within the region toward less productive areas. Central to these results is the estimated negative correlation between the education costs and local fundamentals, as well as inefficiencies in the spatial allocation due to externalities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multifaceted social protection programs in low-income countries often include both capital grants and informational and behavioral support on the premise that households face simultaneous and multiple frictions. To tackle informational and behavioral constraints, programs typically deploy either individual or group coaching visits from field agents. The relative efficacy of individual versus group coaching could provide insights into the underlying mechanism through which information and behavioral support change household decisions. However, in three similar randomized evaluations in Uganda, the Philippines, and Bangladesh, we find no differences in efficacy. Given its 15–20% lower costs, group coaching is more cost-effective.</content>

    <title>Bond Convenience Yields in the Eurozone Currency Union</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a monetary union, the risk-free rate cannot adjust to country-level fiscal positions, leaving only default spreads and convenience yields to respond. Empirically, we find that convenience yields explain a large share of the variation in Eurozone sovereign bond yields. Eurozone sovereign bonds earn larger convenience yields when their governments run larger surpluses. Since convenience yields generate substantial seigniorage revenue from debt issuance, our estimates imply economically large fiscal costs from low convenience yields for peripheral countries in the Eurozone.</content>

    <title>FCI-plot: Central Bank Communication Through Financial Conditions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of central bank communication where market participants' uncertainty about desired financial conditions creates misunderstandings ("tantrums") and amplifies the impact of financial noise on asset prices and economic activity. We show that directly communicating the expected financial conditions path (FCI-plot) eliminates tantrums and recruits arbitrageurs to insulate conditions from noise, while communicating expected interest rates alone fails to achieve these benefits. We demonstrate that scenario-based FCI-plot communication enhances recruitment when participants disagree with the central bank regarding scenario probabilities. This enables an "agree-to-disagree" equilibrium where markets help implement central bank objectives despite differing views.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive global issue, with approximately one in three women experiencing IPV over their lifetime. IPV prevalence is higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and costs of IPV are also considerably larger as a percentage of GDP in LMICs.  We present the economic theory behind IPV and highlight some important determinants such as poverty and societal norms. We then synthesize the causal evidence on the impact of a range of policies and interventions, highlighting approaches which have been effective in reducing IPV. We identify key insights from the existing literature and outline areas where further theoretical and empirical research is needed.</content>

    <title>Fractional Ownership and Copyright Licensing: Evidence from the Music Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creative content is often the product of collaboration, which may lead to fractional ownership of intellectual property. We study the effect of fractional ownership on the licensing of copyrighted material and its reuse. To do so, we compile new data on the copyright ownership structure of songs and their licensing for use in movies. We document that fractional song ownership has increased substantially: the mean number of songwriters and publishers per song has tripled between 1958 and 2021. We show that, conditional on a rich set of controls, greater fractionalization is associated with lower likelihood of licensing. We leverage the Sony-led acquisition of EMI Music Publishing in 2012 to obtain within-song variation in ownership and find that consolidating ownership rights significantly increases licensing, beyond any standalone effects of the merger.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents new stylized facts about returns and cashflow growth rates on stocks and housing over decade-long holding periods. While cashflow growth rates on the two assets comove positively, their returns comove negatively until the Global Financial Crisis and positively thereafter. These facts present a puzzle for representative-agent models that imply positive return comovement for assets with similar cashflows. I consider a heterogeneous-agent model with segmented stock and housing markets connected through credit. News about the aggregate economy generates negative return comovement. Recent shifts such as wealthier homebuyers and institutional housing purchases reduce the importance of credit and segmentation.</content>

    <title>The Past and Future of U.S. Structural Change: Compositional Accounting and Forecasting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the evolving significance of different production sectors within the U.S. economy since World War II and provide methods for estimating and forecasting these shifts. Using a compositional accounting approach, we find that the well-documented transition from goods to services is primarily driven by two compositional changes: 1) the rise of Intellectual Property Products (IPP) as an input producer, replacing Durable Goods almost one-for-one in terms of input shares in virtually all sectors; and 2) a shift in consumer spending from Nondurable Goods to Services. A structural model replicating these shifts reveals that the rise of IPP at the expense of Durable Goods is largely explained by increases in the efficiency of IPP inputs used in production: input-biased technical change. Trend variations in sectoral total factor productivity, and their attendant effects on relative prices and income, are the main driver of evolving consumption patterns. Both reduced-form and structural forecasts project these trends to continue over the next two decades, albeit at lower rates, indicating a slower pace of structural change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a fracturing world, how can low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) continue to leverage trade for economic development? Drawing on recent research at this intersection, this review argues that countries should look inward toward domestic reforms in key factor markets. I review evidence on how trade in LMICs is shaped by frictions in labor, capital, material, land, and information markets, and highlight areas where the evidence base remains thin. I concluded with a discussion of vertical policies relevant for LMICs—particularly the role of services—and suggest areas where further research is needed to assess whether development can be service-led.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over one third of children in the U.S. are investigated by the child protection system (CPS) by age 18, but the effects of this interaction on families and children are largely unknown. Investigations aim to protect children from harm and direct services to families in need. However, they also bring the implicit threat of child removal, which can generate both stress and institutional distrust among affected families. Using a regression discontinuity design, we study the impacts of this interaction on child health. Children who are just above the threshold for being “defaulted” into an investigation see a reduction in injuries and an increase in preventative care in the two months following the referral. Effects are consistent across child gender, race and age. Finally, investigations increase the likelihood that a parent is jailed, suggesting that investigations also detect criminal activity within the home. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that it is the investigation, rather than home removal or parental criminal justice system involvement, which improves child health.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use detailed data on the evolution of health for about 0.8 million Black and 5.4 million white nursing home patients covered by Medicare between 2011 and 2019 to estimate race-specific value-added measures for more than 8,000 nursing homes in the United States. We estimate that the average nursing home value-added experienced by Black patients is about 30% lower than that received by white patients. Most of this gap reflects differences in value-added experienced by similar Black and white patients within the same nursing home, rather than differences in value-added across the nursing homes they go to.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents that during the late 20th Century, nominal government bonds and stocks tended to comove positively, whereas during the first quarter of the 21st Century they have tended to comove negatively.  A similar sign switch is observable for real government bonds and breakeven inflation rates.  Recent macroeconomic events have caused short-lived changes in these comovements, and periods with high risk premia tend to be periods in which bond-stock comovements are large in absolute value.  The paper surveys theoretical models of these phenomena.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Genetic Predisposition to a Higher BMI on Education Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of early-life health on education by estimating the effect of genetic predisposition to a higher body mass index (BMI) on educational attainment and related outcomes. The identification strategy exploits the randomness in which genes one inherits from one's parents by estimating sibling fixed effects models of the polygenic score for a higher BMI. These models are estimated using rich administrative data from Denmark for over 14,000 full siblings. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the genetic predisposition to a higher BMI is associated with a 1.4 percentage point (4.4%) lower probability of earning a high school diploma, a 1.7 percentage point (12.3%) lower probability of a college degree, and a 1.7 percentage point (3.7%) higher probability of vocational training. An investigation into mechanisms suggests that youth with a greater genetic predisposition to a higher BMI are more likely to report being bullied, have greater school absences, and lower test scores.</content>

    <title>Not Flourishing</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine evidence on the well-being and ill-being of the young for 22 countries in the Global Flourishing Study (GFS) 2022-2024 with the commonly used 12-component “flourishing” index and a new 4-component “not flourishing” index.  Although flourishing is U-shaped in age in the pooled data it rises in age in 13 countries and declines in 7.  By contrast, not-flourishing declines in age overall, and in each of its four components, and it declines in age in 15 of the 22 countries.  We explore sensitivity of results to survey mode in countries using both computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and computer-assisted web-based interviews (CAWI).  When CATI is used, the young are happier than other age groups, but the opposite is the case when data are collected via CAWI.  We validate the findings with analyses from two other data sets.  First, we construct flourishing and not flourishing indices using different variables for the four European countries in the GFS - Germany, Spain, Sweden and UK - from the interviewer based European Social Survey (ESS) of 2023-2024.  As with the GFS, the not-flourishing data shows ill-being declines in age while the flourishing data is more mixed.  Second, we examine the internet-based Global Minds (GM) surveys, 2020-2025, on the same group of countries, and find well-being rises in age for all in both flourishing and not-flourishing variables.  We argue that trends in youth suicide, self-harm and mental health hospitalizations are consistent with the age patterns in the not-flourishing index and with the internet-based survey evidence from both the flourishing and not-flourishing indexes.</content>

    <title>Climate Change, Conflict, and the Risk of Economic Collapse in Africa</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is human-caused climate change likely to trigger enduring economic decline in modern societies? We study whether changes in violent conflict and economic growth caused by warming could interact to degrade economic opportunities and trap African countries in poverty. We provide evidence of an emerging high-conflict and low-growth "poverty trap" equilibrium in Africa and describe theoretically how such an equilibrium could result from warming. We then combine historical data on temperature, growth, and conflict with projections from a large ensemble of global climate models to evaluate the risk that warming and subsequent conflict could push African economies into a regime of sustained negative economic growth. We find that the risk of such "economic collapse" is material in a moderate-to-high emissions scenario. We estimate that in Africa, a current "high" emissions trajectory (RCP 7.0) may increase the incidence of conflict 5.1 percentage points (95% CI 0.2-13.0) and increase the share of countries with net negative GDP growth this century by 12.2 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-27.5).  We calculate that roughly 82% of this additional conflict risk and 14% of projected GDP losses are due to the interacting effects between these two outcomes, underscoring the importance of accounting for their indirect effects and feedbacks. Our findings suggest an unprecedented scale of emissions mitigation, economic policy innovation or institutional investment that would be required to contain the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change in many African countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a theory of firm dynamics and capital reallocation in private firms and use it to study the taxation of business income, capital, and capital gains. Intangible assets—such as customer bases and trade names—are created using owners' time and are infrequently traded in bilateral meetings. We discipline the model with U.S. administrative data, which report purchase prices and counterparties in asset transfers, allowing us to calibrate the investment technology and output elasticity for otherwise unobservable intangible capital. The equilibrium features dispersion in marginal product of capital, transferable share of firm value, and return on business wealth. Introducing taxation, we find that capital gains taxes are most distortionary, primarily by discouraging entry and reallocation of capital, whereas income taxes are least distortionary.</content>

    <title>The Impact of AI and Digital Platforms on the Information Ecosystem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable model to study how AI and digital platforms impact the information ecosystem. News producers — who create truthful or untruthful content that becomes a public good or bad — earn revenue from consumer visits. Consumers search for information and differ in their ability to distinguish truthful from untruthful information. AI and digital platforms influence the ecosystem by: improving the efficiency of processing and transmission of information, endangering the producer business model, changing the relative cost of producing misinformation and altering the ability of consumers to screen quality. We find that in the absence of adequate regulation (accountability, content moderation, and intellectual property protection) the quality of the information ecosystem may decline, both because the equilibrium quantity of truthful information declines and the share of misinformation increases; and polarization may intensify. While some of these problems are already evident with digital platforms, AI may have different, and overall more adverse, impacts.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Immunotherapy on Reductions in Cancer Mortality: Evidence from Medicare</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Immunotherapy is a breakthrough innovation in cancer care but is also among the most expensive treatments, with costs exceeding $150,000 per patient. We study the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the most widely used class of immunotherapy drugs. In 2022, ICIs accounted for 44% of the $17.5 billion Medicare Part B cancer drug spending. We focus on metastatic melanoma, the first approved indication for ICIs. While overall cancer mortality rates declined since the 1990s, melanoma mortality rates increased through the early 2010s. Following the first ICI approvals in 2011 and 2014, melanoma mortality declined sharply. Using traditional Medicare claims, we estimate the impact of the introduction of ICIs on healthcare utilization, costs, and 1-year survival for patients with metastatic melanoma, relative to metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), where ICIs were not approved until 2017. Variation in approval timing allows us to isolate the effect of ICIs from broader cancer care trends. We find that ICIs reduced 1-year mortality by 6.2%. Since about 1 in 5 metastatic melanoma patients received ICIs, this implies a 27.5% reduction among treated patients. The introduction of ICIs also reduced chemotherapy and radiation use, but increased Medicare spending by 59.3% or about 260% among ICI-treated patients. Accounting for life expectancy gains beyond one year, the benefits of ICIs for melanoma patients appear comparable, or potentially even greater, than the substantial added Medicare costs. Nonetheless, ICI use remains relatively low given large survival benefits and few alternative treatments, suggesting that costs and other barriers limit patient access.</content>

    <title>Genius on Demand: The Value of Transformative Artificial Intelligence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the emergence of transformative AI systems providing ``genius on demand" would affect knowledge worker allocation and labour market outcomes. We develop a simple model distinguishing between routine knowledge workers, who can only apply existing knowledge with some uncertainty, and genius workers, who create new knowledge at a cost increasing with distance from a known point. When genius capacity is scarce, we find it should be allocated primarily to questions at domain boundaries rather than at midpoints between known answers. The introduction of AI geniuses fundamentally transforms this allocation. In the short run, human geniuses specialise in questions that are furthest from existing knowledge, where their comparative advantage over AI is greatest. In the long run, routine workers may be completely displaced if AI efficiency approaches human genius efficiency.</content>

    <title>What Can Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning Measure?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Satellite imagery and machine learning (SIML) are increasingly being combined to remotely measure social and environmental outcomes, yet use of this technology has been limited by insufficient understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Here, we undertake the most extensive effort yet to characterize the potential and limits of using a SIML technology to measure ground conditions. We conduct 115 standardized large-scale experiments using a composite high-resolution optical image of Earth and a generalizable SIML technology to evaluate what can be accurately measured and where this technology struggles. We find that SIML alone predicts roughly half the variation in ground measurements on average, and that variables describing human society (e.g. female literacy, R²=0.55) are generally as easily measured as natural variables (e.g. bird diversity, R²=0.55). Patterns of performance across measured variable type, space, income and population density indicate that SIML can likely support many new applications and decision-making use cases, although within quantifiable limits.</content>

    <title>Incorporating Non-Unitary Income Elasticities, Choke Prices and Choke Incomes into Applied General-Equilibrium Models</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional applied general-equilibrium (AGE) models have always faced trade-offs between analytical and computational tractability and counter-empirical restrictions. One is the assumption of homothetic preferences implying unitary income elasticities of demand, significantly inconsistent with data. Similarly, there is no “choke” income level, below which a certain good is not purchased and there is no choke price above which a good is not purchased, implying no changes in the extensive margin of trade. Here I exploit what I will label a Stone-Geary Modified (SGM) formulation. This produces a model in which there are non-unitary income elasticities, choke income levels for some/all goods, and choke prices. The second approach modifies CRIE (constant relative income elasticity) preferences which are preferred for modeling income elasticities, but don’t by themselves permit choke income and prices. While other authors have explored these properties in alternative ways, both my approaches have considerable advantages for high-dimension simulation models in that they retain CES structures and functional forms so that they can slot right into existing modeling formats. They require only small modifications to off-the-shelf cost and expenditure functions, and therefore goods and factor demand functions via Shepard’s lemma. Unobserved parameters can be calibrated from observed data and econometric estimates.</content>

    <title>Understanding and Addressing Temperature Impacts on Mortality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature documents how ambient temperature affects human mortality. Using decades of detailed data from 30 countries, we revisit and synthesize key findings from this literature. We confirm that ambient temperature is among the largest external threats to human health, and is responsible for a remarkable 5-12% of total deaths across countries in our sample, or hundreds of thousands of deaths per year in both the U.S. and EU. In all contexts we consider, cold kills more than heat, though the temperature of minimum risk rises with age, making younger individuals more vulnerable to heat and older individuals more vulnerable to cold. We find evidence for adaptation to the local climate, with hotter places experiencing somewhat lower risk at higher temperatures, but still more overall mortality from heat due to more frequent exposure. Within countries, higher income is not associated with uniformly lower vulnerability to ambient temperature, and the overall burden of mortality from ambient temperature is not falling over time. Finally, we systematically summarize the limited set of studies that rigorously evaluate interventions that can reduce the impact of heat and cold on health. We find that many proposed and implemented policy interventions lack empirical support and do not target temperature exposures that generate the highest health burden, and that some of the most beneficial interventions for reducing the health impacts of cold or heat have little explicit to do with climate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much can AI accelerate progress in different research fields?  This paper shows that three features—the share of research tasks AI performs, the productivity of AI at those tasks, and the strength of bottlenecks—are key determinants of AI’s implications in any area, from cancer therapeutics to software design. The model maps changes in AI capabilities to research outcomes, quantifies the “marginal returns to intelligence,” and shows how AI can shift returns to R&amp;D investment. Concepts like superintelligence, Powerful AI, and Transformative AI are further engaged and disciplined.  Finally, the framework sets a measurement agenda linking AI benchmarks to field-specific opportunities for accelerating progress.</content>

    <title>What Does It Take? Quantifying Cross-Country Transfers in the Eurozone</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compute the cross-country transfers that result from unconventional monetary policy in the Eurozone. The ECB funds the expansion of its aggregate balance sheet mostly by issuing bank reserves and cash in core countries. The national central banks (NCBs) in periphery countries then borrow from the core NCBs at below-market rates to fund the asset purchases and bank lending. In addition, NCBs in the periphery lend more to their own banks at below-market rates. To compute the cross-country transfers, we compare the resulting cross-country distribution of NCB income to a counterfactual scenario without the ECB and without non-marketable intra-Eurozone debt. We document significant and persistent transfers from the core to the periphery.</content>

    <title>Private Equity, Consumers, and Competition: Evidence from the Nursing Home Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how product market competition shapes the impact of private equity (PE) acquisitions on consumers. We examine nursing home buyouts and observe that PE-owned facilities exhibit greater competitive sensitivity: competing more aggressively when competitive incentives are strong and exploiting market power more aggressively when competitive incentives are weak. We find that PE-owned facilities are more sensitive to local market competition—even when comparing effects only across facilities purchased as part of the same acquisition—and are more responsive to a pro-competitive policy helping consumers compare facilities. This suggests that the competitive sensitivity of acquirers and the concentration of markets where acquisitions occur are important factors contributing to the effects of a merger, as well as that pro-competitive polices can reshape the effects of PE ownership on consumers.</content>

    <title>Tariffs as Fiscal Policy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The year 2025 brought a remarkable shift in the role of tariffs in the US economy, as the Trump administration simultaneously escalated the use of broad tariffs and ensured that Congress enacted large income tax cuts. This fiscal switch has important implications for the US tax system. While maintaining tariff rates at summer 2025 levels would generate large government revenues, such broad tariffs have significant downsides: Efficiency losses would approach one-third of revenues raised, the tax system would be less progressive, and there would be serious tax administration concerns. The fiscal shift also has significant macroeconomic implications, although probably not the intended ones. Broad tariffs generate a large negative supply shock, simultaneously raising prices and reducing macroeconomic activity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that the positive differential on international portfolio returns, one aspect of the U.S. exorbitant privilege, has disappeared in three parts. Part One: U.S. international liabilities used to be mostly in low-return bonds while its international assets were largely in high-returning equities, thus naturally producing a positive return differential. More recently, however, U.S. equity liabilities have increased sharply, reducing this compositional tailwind. Part Two: While the exorbitant privilege literature has focused on expected returns as proxied by the sample arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is also required to produce an unbiased estimate of expected returns. Incorporating geometric means greatly reduces the returns differential. Part Three is a combined switch a) from aggregate to comprehensive security-level data to more accurately calculate returns and b) from expected to actual realized returns that take into account the timing and magnitude of portfolio flows. The combined effect of these changes is that over the past two decades the U.S. portfolio returns differential was not 228 bps but zero, and it is expected to be zero for the next decade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter reviews the origins, evolution, and modern forms of government, and proposes a research agenda. It contends that rather than being a homogeneous form of patrimonialism, early government was diverse and, at times, fostered order and prosperity. Its subsequent development did not follow an ‘evolutionary’ path to rational-legal government but was characterized by innovation and frequent collapse. Successful modern states do not all look alike, but follow several different models, as historical states have done.</content>

    <title>Information, Spillovers, or Hassle Costs? Effects of Medicaid Prior Authorization on Preschool Antipsychotic Prescribing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine information versus hassle costs in the context of Medicaid prior authorization requirements for preschool antipsychotic prescribing. Such prescribing increased in the 1990s, despite substantial side effects and the absence of FDA approval. State Medicaid programs began to require prior authorization for antipsychotic prescribing to young children after 2005. We evaluate these policies using hand-collected policy data and national prescription data for 2006-2019. We find that prior authorization reduced prescriptions to children under six by 22-30% in the two years after implementation. There were no effects on privately insured or older children, suggesting little role for information spillovers.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide novel evidence on how healthcare decision-making responds to changes in government recommendations by studying the United States Preventive Services Task Force’s 2009 decision to stop recommending mammogram screenings for women aged 40-49. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that the guideline revision reduced mammography among 40-49-year-old women by 6-10 percent (from a baseline rate of 48.8 percent) relative to their older counterparts. We also identify large spillovers onto women aged 30-39 who were subsequently 25 percent less likely to receive a mammogram recommendation (from a baseline rate of 22.8 percent) and up to 60 percent less likely to receive a mammogram (from a baseline rate of 12.6 percent). Additional analyses suggest the revision reduced overdiagnosis of early-stage tumors. Finally, we find that the 2009 update increased confusion about recommendations for preventing cancer.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does community rating distort relative prices for vertically differentiated plans in insurance markets? We show that common community-rating approaches can distort price differentials in the opposite direction to the distortions in overall price levels. Partial age-based community rating in the U.S. private health insurance exchanges causes older individuals to pay marginal prices for generous coverage significantly above marginal cost, while younger enrollees are subsidized on the margin. These distortions are large enough that older individuals often face and sometimes choose dominated options. We present simulations and theoretical discussions of community rating’s impacts on efficiency and distributional outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The majority of global trade moves by sea through hub-and-spoke shipping networks. We investigate the returns to being a hub country by analyzing how transshipment activity shapes trade and supply chains. We show that most US imports---especially from smaller origin countries---are transshipped via key hubs, and transshipment is positively correlated with the hub's product-level trade. Leveraging the indirect shipping network structure to construct an instrument, we find that transshipment increases hubs' imports from origins for which they facilitate trade and exports of downstream goods, highlighting their central role in shaping modern global trade and supply chain dynamics.</content>

    <title>Social Costs of Work Disruptions: Evidence from Physicians and their Patients</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work disruptions among women are common and costly for workers and firms, but do consumers also shoulder some of these costs? We study the impact of physicians’ births—a large, temporary shock to women’s labor supply—on their patients’ access to care, using administrative Medicaid claims data from California. Female physicians reduce their office visits by 85% in the quarter after giving birth, but return nearly to pre-birth levels within two years. These supply disruptions generate persistent effects on child patients: those whose primary care physician gives birth are less likely to see their usual physician for up to two years and receive less preventative care, including a 50% reduction in vaccination claims and a 42% reduction in lead testing. In contrast, we find little impact on adult patients. The lasting effects on children coincide with fewer pediatrician encounters overall, consistent with limited availability of substitute providers and the central role of pediatricians in monitoring children’s preventative care. Our findings demonstrate how shocks to women’s labor supply can generate persistent consumer welfare losses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides a comprehensive overview of China’s lending to developing countries—a central feature of today’s international financial system. Building on our previous research and the work of others, we document the scale, destination, and terms of China’s overseas lending boom, as well as the lending bust and defaults that have followed. We compare China’s lending boom to past boom-bust cycles and discuss the implications of China’s rise as an international creditor on recipient countries and sovereign debt markets. The evidence indicates that Chinese state banks are assertive and commercially sophisticated lenders. For recipient countries, however, the jury is still out: it remains to be seen whether the gains from China’s lending—through growth and improved infrastructure—will outweigh the more immediate burdens of debt service or the multifaceted costs of default.</content>

    <title>Optimal Trade Policies and Market Power in General Equilibrium Trade Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We derive optimal trade policies in a multi-country, multi-sector general-equilibrium model that unifies a wide range of supply-side assumptions. Under our CES supply system, which nests most existing specifications, two-country optimal tariffs and export taxes across sectors depend only on elasticity parameters and relative market shares. With multiple countries, country and sector interdependencies—due to the cross-country trade network—make optimal tariffs imposed by the home country differ across countries and sectors while converging within sectors. Only when foreign countries do not trade with each other do the home country’s optimal policies depend solely on bilateral trade. Using trade data, we quantify optimal policies and find that ignoring interdependencies can lead to substantially lower welfare gains for the home country.</content>

    <title>The Global Economic Impact of Climate Change: An Empirical Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical research has revolutionized how we understand the global economic impacts of climate change. Recent empirical analyses have tested theoretical ideas, challenged prior estimates, and revealed important and unexpected impacts. Further, the credibility and replicability of empirical results have played a critical role in guiding high-stakes climate policies. Here, I describe the landscape of empirical economic research on global impacts, I explain elements of modern analyses, I summarize recent findings on a range of topics, and I point towards promising new areas of investigation. In particular, I focus on empirical perspectives for six “grand challenges” in the field: understanding climate change’s global impact on economic output, health, conflict, food security, disasters, and migration. Overall, I argue that interwoven empirical findings across outcomes are aligning to paint an increasingly coherent picture of a future global economy impacted by climate change. Taking the literature as a whole, the global consequences of unmitigated climate change are likely to be substantial, unequal, negative in net economic value and potentially destabilizing.</content>

    <title>The Economic Geography of American Slavery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What would the antebellum American economy have looked like without slavery? Using new micro-data on the U.S. economy in 1860, we document that where free and enslaved workers live and how much they earn correlates strongly—but differently—with geographic proxies for agricultural productivity, disease, and ease of slave escape. To explain these patterns, we build a quantitative spatial model of slavery, where slaveholders coerce enslaved workers into supplying more labor, capture the proceeds of their labor, and assign them to sectors and occupations that maximize owner profits rather than worker welfare. Combining theory and data, we then quantify how dismantling the institution of slavery affected the spatial economy. We find that the economic impacts of emancipation are substantial, generating welfare gains for the enslaved of roughly 1,200%, while reducing welfare of free workers by 0.7% and eliminating slaveholder profit. Aggregate GDP rises by 9.1%, with a contraction in agricultural productivity counteracted by an expansion in manufacturing and services driven by an exodus of formerly enslaved workers out of agriculture and into the U.S. North.</content>

    <title>From the Classroom to the Ballot Box: Turnout and Partisan Consequences of Education</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the impact of education on voter turnout and partisanship using a regression discontinuity design based on school-entry cutoffs and exact date of birth. Drawing on nationwide administrative voter registration data, we find that individuals who were slotted to enter school one year earlier are more likely to vote and more likely to register as independents. These reduced-form effects may be driven by changes in educational attainment or by differences in the quality of individuals’ educational experiences. We leverage age-related heterogeneity in effect sizes to isolate the role of educational attainment. Our results imply that an additional year of schooling increases turnout by about 3 percentage points.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This brief survey reviews recent work on transportation in poor and middle-income countries. After reviewing a few key global facts and taking stock of the data available, it focuses on eight key themes that are emphasized in this literature relative to work on transportation in rich countries. In urban areas, these are private/informal transit, interactions with other informal markets, gender, bus rapid transit, and quantity-based congestion policy. Elsewhere, they are the legacy of colonialism, rural roads, and potential negative effects of improved transportation infrastructure.</content>

    <title>What the Mercantilists Got Right</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economics students today learn about mercantilism through Smith’s prism, as a series of logical and policy errors that Smith clarified and settled for good. But far from settled doctrine, mercantilism encapsulated a variety of pragmatic practices that survived Smith’s critique, often to good effect. It found echo in a continuous tradition of what later came to be called “developmentalism,” running from Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List’s advocacy of trade protection to Hans Singer and Raul Prebisch’s ideas on import-substitution and, more recently, to East Asian models of export-oriented industrialization. Three of its core tenets hold continued appeal: the primacy of production and jobs (and of their composition) over consumption; preference for close, collaborative relationship between business and government over an arms’ length relationship; and the need for contextual, pragmatic, and often unorthodox policies over universal remedies and “best-practices.”</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility, extending the static model of Shapley and Shubik (1971). Forward-looking agents have individual states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching market with market-clearing prices takes place. We prove the existence of an equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and show it is the solution to a social planner’s problem. We also prove that a stationary equilibrium exists. We introduce econometric shocks to account for unobserved heterogeneity in match formation. We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary equilibrium. We adapt both algorithms for estimation. We estimate a model of accumulation of job-specific human capital using data on Swedish engineers.</content>

    <title>Big Beautiful Numbers: The Impact of Governmental Data on Firms' Valuations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the prices of financial options to study the value of macroeconomic data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  I show that options traders expect several data products to contain information relevant to valuations of firms throughout the economy.  The most affected firms tend to be larger and more capital-intensive.  Traders especially anticipate data releases in more recent years and in periods of high uncertainty about economic policy.  Traders expect more relevant information from U.S. government data products than from Federal Reserve policy statements and minutes.</content>

    <title>Jealousy of Trade: Exclusionary Preferences and Economic Nationalism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a new framework for understanding economic nationalism based on an empirically-validated desire for dominance, which generates a preference for exclusionary policies. We incorporate such preferences into a model of international trade. The model predicts that exclusionary preferences lead people to favor tariffs and protectionist policies that harm both their trading partner's and their own consumption. This implies that higher prices caused by exclusionary policies like tariffs will be more acceptable than those caused by non-exclusionary policies. We provide support for these predictions through two survey experiments, which also account for the role of cognitive biases and misinformation.</content>

    <title>Introducing The SPEAK: A Scalable Computer-Adaptive Tool to Measure Knowledge of Early Human Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows responsive caregiving enhances children's brain development, with parental knowledge predicting positive behaviors and outcomes. However, knowledge varies widely across educational levels, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. Despite evidence that this knowledge can be improved, no comprehensive metric exists for efficient assessment. We introduce SPEAK (Survey of Parent/Provider Expectations and Knowledge), a computer-adaptive tool grounded in item-response theory that we created, to address this gap by measuring parental and educator knowledge across development domains with precision and speed. This paper details SPEAK's development, including domain construction, cognitive interviewing, expert review, psychometric calibration, and validity evidence. SPEAK offers a flexible, scalable solution for clinical, educational, research, and policy settings. By identifying knowledge gaps, it enables tailored interventions, supports professional development, and informs policy, ultimately improving parent-child interactions and child outcomes. Our tool bridges critical gaps in assessing child development knowledge, advancing research and cross-sector collaboration to promote early childhood development worldwide.</content>

    <title>A Guide to Climate Damages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multiple lines of research aim to quantify the economic impacts of climate change, including through reduced-form and structural approaches. We show that the effects of climate change on economic activity depend on changes in weather across time and space: changes in contemporary weather have direct effects on output; changes in past weather and in expectations of future weather induce adaptation; and changes in weather elsewhere around the globe introduce a general equilibrium component. Using this framework, we argue that estimation of climate impacts faces a trilemma: a methodology can have at most two of (i) robustness to a particular economic model structure, (ii) interpretation as effects of persistent, widespread, anticipated climate change, and (iii) quasi-experimental identification. We summarize the literature on climate damages in light of the trilemma, with an emphasis on recent progress understanding adaptation and spatial spillovers.  We propose directions for future work.</content>

    <title>What is More Important for Subjective Longevity Expectations: Perceived Health or Income?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research considers the role of income for subjective longevity assessments. The analysis uses the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. My findings indicate that treating subjective health and longevity assessments as jointly determined is important to understanding the role of income for both judgments. Income has a positive effect on health judgments and does not have a statistically significant effect on subjective longevity when health is rated as excellent or good. Surveys framing the longevity question in direct or probabilistic terms may have complementary roles in estimating subjective longevity.</content>

    <title>Who Rides Out the Storm? The Immediate Post-College Transition and its Role in Socioeconomic Earnings Gaps</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite a large earnings premium for bachelor’s degree completion in general, graduates from low-income families earn substantially less than graduates from high-income families. While prior research has documented the role of college quality and major choice in explaining these gaps, we examine undermatching on a different margin: the first (post-college) job transition. The transition from college to the labor market can be challenging to navigate, and students with financial, informational, or other disadvantages during the job search may be more likely to “undermatch” to their first job. Using administrative data from a large, urban, public college system, we document large gaps in earnings five years after graduation by SES (proxied by financial aid receipt) that remain unexplained even after controlling for GPA, college, field of study, and other pre-graduation characteristics. We then examine how features of the initial job transition relate to longer-term earnings, and to what extent differences in the first job transition can explain later SES earnings gaps. Our results show that first job transitions are rocky for many graduates, strongly predict earnings at Year 5, and are a substantial mediator of socioeconomic gaps in earnings five years after college graduation—reducing the unexplained gap by almost two-thirds.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Romantic relationships in the workplace are common, but those between managers and subordinates have increasingly drawn scrutiny. Using administrative data on the universe of cohabiting couples in Finland, we examine the career implications of starting or ending a personal relationship with a workplace manager and the spillovers of these relationships on the broader workforce. An event study design reveals that entering a relationship with a manager increases the subordinate's earnings by 6%, but breaking up triggers an abrupt 18% earnings decline. We also find that these relationships generate spillovers: retention of other workers declines by six percentage points, with effects concentrated in workplaces where subordinates experience greater earnings gains. Our findings highlight both the private benefits and organizational costs of hierarchical workplace relationships.</content>

    <title>Banking Crises, Nonlinear Export Elasticities, and the Dominant Currency Paradigm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dominant currency paradigm posits that dollar invoicing reduces the potency of exchange rate depreciations in boosting export volumes. This implies that export elasticities with respect to the exchange rate are small, rendering even large depreciations ineffectual in the short term. We incorporate two innovations versus existing work. First, we allow for nonlinearities, permitting large depreciations to disproportionately lift exports. Second, we control for banking crises, which accompany many depreciations. Our baseline export elasticity—without nonlinearities or banking crisis controls—is -0.3, consistent with prevailing “elasticity pessimism.” This elasticity rises to between -0.5 and -0.8 within two years for depreciations above 20 percent without banking crises.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital formation enhances worker productivity and firm performance. However, firms may not fully internalize the financial benefits from investing in employee skill-building, which can disincentivize worker training and suggest roles for government support. We examine such tradeoffs in the context of physician training (i.e., “residency” programs). Using the universe of Medicare inpatient and outpatient records from 2014-2019 and differences-in-differences analyses, we show that hospitals’ productivity and revenues grow by 10-20% after underwriting a procedure-oriented residency––though heterogeneity exists. The hospitals benefiting from trainee labor conservatively net over $2 million in steady-state, revealing substantive private incentives to finance physician training.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many communities across the United States have elected reform-minded prosecutors who seek to safely reduce the reach and burden of the criminal justice system. In this paper, we use variation in the timing of when these prosecutors took office across jurisdictions to empirically characterize their policy changes and estimate downstream effects on prison incarceration rates, local reported crime rates, and drug mortality rates. We find that after a reform prosecutor takes office there are consistent and often statistically significant decreases in charging and conviction rates for nonviolent misdemeanor offenses, particularly misdemeanor drug offenses, but not for violent or felony offenses. We find little to no downstream effects on prison incarceration rates and no effects on local reported crime rates or drug mortality rates. These findings suggest that the types of policies being implemented by reform prosecutors appear to be decreasing the footprint of the criminal justice system without adverse effects on public safety.</content>

    <title>The Lower Boundary of Workplace Mistreatment: Do Small Slights Matter?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research in psychology, management, and more recently in economics, highlights the role of individual managers and their behavior in shaping employee performance. While emerging literature on harmful managerial behavior has focused primarily on severe forms of workplace mistreatment, especially various types of harassment, much less is known about its boundary conditions: How minor can a manager’s bad behavior be and still negatively affect employee performance? We study what appears to be a very minor workplace mistreatment—failing to deliver an expected birthday gift and greeting card on time—and examine its effect on subsequent employee performance. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences approach with detailed data from a national retail chain, we find that this small slight leads to over a 50% increase in employee absenteeism and a reduction of more than two working hours per month. Our analysis suggests that emotional responses to perceived workplace mistreatment drive the results. These findings indicate that even modest slights can meaningfully harm employee performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This narrative paper provides a detailed account of the Great Inflation in the United Kingdom from 1961 to 1997, serving as a companion to the analytical account of fiscal policy presented in Bordo, Bush, and Thomas (2025). We discuss the background fundamentals in place at the outset of the Great Inflation and document the distinct phases of inflation, the unique features of the UK’s experience relative to other advanced economies, and the interplay between fiscal, monetary, and incomes policies. By placing the UK’s inflationary episodes within their institutional and historical context, this paper offers a qualitative perspective that complements the quantitative analysis of the main paper and informs ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of persistent inflation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capital controls and other policy distortions in the capital market are costly to entrepreneurs. We propose a structural estimation approach to quantify the effect using IPO locational choices. We estimate the willingness-to-pay to bypass these distortions by the Chinese entrepreneurs with overseas listed firms to be a haircut in firm value by 50-60%. We infer that the welfare for the entrepreneurs could rise by 22% from the relevant capital market reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In China, only 37% of divorce petitions citing domestic violence are granted, with evidence suggesting that judges often prioritize preserving marriages even in cases of abuse. We investigate whether judicial decision-making can shift in response to broader social change. Exploiting the rise of the #MeToo movement, which reshaped societal perceptions of gender-based violence, we find that female judges in China became 8 percentage points more likely to grant divorces in domestic violence cases. These results suggest that judicial attitudes and actions on gender-based violence cases are malleable.</content>

    <title>Ten Years of Relational Power: The Long-Run Effects of Teaching Negotiation Skills to Adolescent Girls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effects of teaching negotiation skills to adolescent girls in economically vulnerable compounds in Lusaka, Zambia ten years later. Treated participants complete 0.27 more years of education. Consistent with greater relational empowerment, they also begin sexual activity later, marry later, have smaller age gaps with their husbands, are less likely to report a high likelihood of having HIV, and express less traditional gender attitudes. Social benefits and costs from HIV reduction and increased education suggest the intervention generated 7.8-16.2 dollars for every dollar spent and may have paid for itself in government revenues.</content>

    <title>What is the Best Response? Examining the Impact of Police and Their Alternatives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cities across America are adopting civilian crisis response programs as alternatives to traditional policing, yet causal evidence on their impact and cost-effectiveness is scarce. This paper evaluates Durham, North Carolina’s HEART program, which diverts nonviolent 911 calls from police. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that HEART reduces crime reports, arrests, and response times—primarily through civilian phone and in-person responses, rather than police-civilian co-responses. The program increases future 911 calls, which suggests it fosters public trust. Based on an original contingent valuation survey and applying the marginal value of public funds framework, we conclude that HEART is a fiscally self-sustainable intervention.</content>

    <title>Supervising Failing Banks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the role of banking supervision in anticipating, monitoring, and disciplining failing banks. We document that supervisors anticipate most bank failures with a high degree of accuracy. Supervisors play an important role in requiring troubled banks to recognize losses, taking enforcement actions, and ultimately closing failing banks. To establish causality, we exploit exogenous variation in supervisory strictness during the Global Financial Crisis. Stricter supervision leads to more loss recognition, reduced dividend payouts, and an increase in the likelihood and speed of closure. Increased strictness entails a trade-off between a lower resolution cost to the FDIC and reduced credit.</content>

    <title>Asset Returns as Carbon Taxes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In frictionless financial markets, a carbon tax on energy users provides the same incentives as a replicating asset price schedule that depends on emissions. In particular, the replicating rate of return on a firm increases linearly in scope 1 emissions relative to enterprise value. We use this result to interpret pollution premia measured by recent empirical studies and conclude that markets currently provide only modest incentives. Replicating a serious carbon tax requires high returns in the right tail of the emission intensity distribution. With heterogeneous investors, such returns are not sustainable unless essentially everyone perceives large nonpecuniary costs from holding dirty capital. Substantial emission reductions can be achieved, however, when even a small share of investors perceive nonpecuniary benefits from owning clean electricity capital.</content>

    <title>Measuring What Matters: Why Italy May Be in Better Fiscal Shape than the US</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study uses fiscal gap accounting (FGA) and generational accounting (GA) to compare US and Italian fiscal solvency. FGA and GA incorporate all government outlays and receipts, whether put on or kept off the books. FGA measures, in the form of reduced net outlays, the constant share of each future year’s GDP needed to balance the government’s intertemporal budget. GA calculates the lifetime net tax rate – lifetime taxes divided by lifetime labor earnings -- facing future generations if current generations pay nothing more, on net, than current policy mandates. Deficit accounting suggests that Italy’s 135 percent debt-to-GDP ratio places it in worse fiscal shape than the US with its 123 percent ratio. But on a fiscal-gap basis, Italy appears in far better shape regardless of the discount rate used. Based on the theoretically appropriate rate – the average real return to national wealth, the U.S. fiscal gap is 7.4%. Italy’s is 4.0%. These requisite solvency adjustments are far larger if delayed or if the UN’s more pessimistic demographic projections prevail. Neither country can expect future generations, on their own, to cover their government’s red ink. Doing so requires levying lifetime net tax rates, in each country, that exceed 100%.</content>
