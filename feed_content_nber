    <title>The Implications of Sorting for Immigrant Wage Assimilation and Changing Cohort Quality in Canada</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Immigrant integration is a central issue in policy debates, with wage assimilation serving as a key indicator of immigrants’ economic success. Using matched employer–employee data from Canada, we study how access to higher-paying firms affects the economic assimilation of immigrants. Immigrants are disproportionately concentrated in lower-paying firms, accounting for much of the observed inequality. Nearly half of this sorting occurs across industries, and both firm- and industry-level wage gaps stagnate after eight years, suggesting that further assimilation reflects human capital accumulation rather than improved firm access. Importantly, these disparities persist after controlling for estimates of worker skill, indicating barriers to high-paying firms rather than differences in human capital. The analysis further shows that Canada’s post-2015 immigration policy reforms significantly improved immigrant outcomes: the initial wage gap narrowed by 25–35%, with roughly half of the improvement attributable to better allocation into higher-paying firms. Taken together, the findings highlight the critical role of firm sorting and its interaction with immigration policy in shaping the economic integration of immigrants.</content>

    <title>The Mortgage Debt Channel of Monetary Policy when Mortgages are Liquid</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine what is widely considered to be one of the strongest channels of monetary policy transmission into household spending – the effect of changes in mortgage payments when mortgage rates are linked to the short-term policy rate. Using bank transactions data from Australia, we analyze a cumulative 425 basis point increase in the central bank policy rate, which caused mortgage repayments for homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages to increase by $13,800. We find little change in the spending of adjustable-rate mortgagors relative to fixed rate mortgagors. This is because adjustable-rate mortgages come with redraw facilities that make mortgages liquid, and households had large excess buffers due to pandemic-era transfer programs and restrictions on spending. Our findings demonstrate that the direct effects of a monetary policy tightening on household spending need not be large.</content>

    <title>Optimizing Retirement Financial Strategies: Integrating Annuities, Defined Contribution Plans, and Long-Term Care Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nursing home costs in the United States now exceed $100,000 per year, and government assistance programs such as Medicaid help out only when retirees are largely destitute. Moreover, health shocks driving the need for such care can arise suddenly in old age, are frequently permanent in nature, and can be associated with declining mental and physical abilities. These facts raise the important question of how households can best prepare to finance this final phase of life. Building on past research, we determine how retirees should manage payouts from defined contribution plans to balance trade-offs between consumption and health care cost shocks, using both retirement plan assets and annuitization. Our analysis explicitly integrates the role of taxes, required minimum distributions, bequest motives, and the possibility of retiree insolvency. We conclude that payout annuities, especially deferred and variable annuities, can be quite valuable for retirees, even when they face health shocks in later life.</content>

    <title>The Economic Impact of Brexit</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union (Brexit) in 2016. Using almost a decade of data since the referendum, we combine simulations based on macro data with estimates derived from micro data collected through our Decision Maker Panel survey. These estimates suggest that by 2025, Brexit had reduced UK GDP by 6% to 8%, with the impact accumulating gradually over time. We estimate that investment was reduced by between 12% and 18%, employment by 3% to 4% and productivity by 3% to 4%. These large negative impacts reflect a combination of elevated uncertainty, reduced demand, diverted management time, and increased misallocation of resources from a protracted Brexit process. Comparing these with contemporary forecasts – providing a rare macro example to complement the burgeoning micro-literature of social science predictions – shows that these forecasts were accurate over a 5-year horizon, but they underestimated the impact over a decade.</content>

    <title>Restrictive Marriage Migration Policies and Family Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As cross-border marriages rise, many governments have tightened rules on who can marry across borders, often in the name of promoting integration. Cross-border couples tend to have high divorce rates, which hinders successful assimilation. This paper provides the first evidence on how restrictive marriage migration policies affect family outcomes of migrants. We exploit a 2014 reform in South Korea that introduced pre-entry requirements for marriage visas, with language proficiency as the key component. Using rich administrative and survey data, we show that the reform led to a sharp temporary decline in cross-border marriages, improved migrants’ language skills, and increased educational attainment among both migrants and their Korean spouses. Comparing marriage cohorts immediately before and after the reform cutoff date, we find that cumulative divorce rates fell by 37% in the first 12 months and by 12% in the first 48 months, primarily due to language-based selection rather than demographic factors. Our evidence indicates that improved communication enhanced marital surplus and highlights the potential positive impact of selective admission policies that target civil and cultural assimilation.</content>

    <title>Branching Out: Capital Mobility and Long-Run Growth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the long-run effects of the first wave of U.S. banking market integration on capital mobility and manufacturing productivity. Using newly digitized bank and branch balance sheet data matched to state and county panels, we provide direct evidence that branching produced lasting productivity gains without aggregate capital deepening by leveraging internal capital markets to improve the geographic allocation of capital. Our novel ``deposit market access'' measure shows that bank funding grew most in capital-constrained counties within branching states. Both market access and border discontinuity designs indicate that branching’s organizational structure reduced capital allocation frictions to generate persistent growth.</content>

    <title>Does Regulation Distort Exit Decisions? Evidence from U.S. Power Plants</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hundreds of power plants have closed in the United States since 2010, including 130+ gigawatts of coal and 50+ gigawatts of natural gas. In this paper, we highlight the potential for regulation to distort this type of exit decision. Using generator-level data from 2010–2023, we show that regulated units have been 45% less likely to exit than unregulated units. For unregulated units, exit decisions are made based on wholesale electricity prices, ongoing capital costs, and other traditional economic factors. In contrast, owners of regulated units are largely insulated from these factors and, in some cases, have a strong incentive to continue operating capital-intensive equipment. Previous work documents how this regulatory distortion affects investment decisions. Our paper emphasizes that these same incentives affect exit decisions as well.</content>

    <title>The Consequences of Faculty Sexual Misconduct</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Faculty sexual misconduct targeted at students is a widespread problem. The consequences of such incidents include direct harm to victims and may also entail a loss to science if students who encounter misconduct become discouraged from continuing their studies in their chosen field. We link publicly available information on degree completion by institution, academic field, and gender to a database of faculty sexual misconduct incidents verified in the media or court cases. Then, we employ a stacked event study approach to document the extent to which faculty sexual misconduct decreases in-field degree completion. Exposure to a field-specific faculty sexual misconduct incident decreases degree completion in that field by 3.4 percent four years after the incident. This decline is driven by incidents occurring after 2015, among which we observe a 7 percent decline in in-field degree completion. Students exit majors dominated by men, but this shift has little effect on predicted earnings because students shift away from both high- and low-earning majors.</content>

    <title>Is Video Watching Bad for Kids? The Effect of Video Watching on Children's Skills</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents video consumption among school-aged children in the U.S. and explores its impact on human capital development. Video watching is common across all segments of society, yet surprisingly little is known about its developmental consequences. With a bunching identification strategy, we find that an additional hour of daily video consumption has a negative impact on children’s noncognitive skills, with harmful effects on both internalizing behaviors (e.g., depression) and externalizing behaviors (e.g., social difficulties). We find a positive effect on math skills, though the effect on an aggregate measure of cognitive skills is smaller and not statistically significant. These findings are robust and largely stable across most demographics and different ways of measuring skills and video watching. We find evidence that for Hispanic children, video watching has positive effects on both cognitive and noncognitive skills—potentially reflecting its role in supporting cultural assimilation. Interestingly, the marginal effects of video watching remain relatively stable regardless of how much time children spend on the activity, with similar incremental impacts observed among those who watch very little and those who watch for many hours.</content>

    <title>Present Bias and Discount Rate Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent evidence in the psychology literature suggests that individuals' degree of present bias varies with the state of nature and increases under stress. Consistent with this notion, we document, using survey data on individuals’ expected and realized consumption growth, that agents indeed tend to overconsume relative to their expectations and that the degree of such overconsumption is higher in bad times. We analyze the asset pricing implications of this bias and show that even if they control a small fraction of wealth, investors with time-varying degree of present bias cause substantial, priced discount rate risks that have first-order impact on the level and time-variation of asset risk premiums. The mechanism is distinct from that of models with time-varying preference parameters and that of models with biased expectations about aggregate outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study presents the first evidence, to our knowledge, of the effects of the surge in interior immigration apprehensions in 2025 in the United States on student academic performance using detailed student-level administrative records from Florida. We find evidence that immigration enforcement reduced test scores for both U.S.-born and foreign-born Spanish-speaking students while also reducing the likelihood that these students are involved in disciplinary incidents in schools. Both of these effects are more pronounced for students in middle and high schools.</content>

    <title>Leaving Money on the Dashboard: Price Dispersion and Search Frictions on Uber and Lyft</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document price differences for identical trips on Uber and Lyft, based on an audit of the two platforms. While price dispersion exists in the market, device-level data show that only 16.1 percent of consumers opening one app also open the other. Our estimates suggest that the modest frictions involved in comparison shopping increase platforms’ gross booking volume by over $300 million annually in New York City alone. While price-comparison engines could in principle reduce frictions, Uber’s API terms of use limit such services, reducing riders’ ability to price compare.</content>

    <title>Breaking Parity: Equilibrium Exchange Rates and Currency Premia</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We offer a unifying empirical model of covered and uncovered currency premia, interest rates and spot and forward exchange rates, both in the cross section and time series of currencies. We find that the rich empirical patterns are in line with a partial equilibrium model of the currency market, where hedged and unhedged currency is supplied by intermediary banks subject to value-at-risk balance-sheet constraints, emphasizing the frictional nature of equilibrium currency premia and exchange rate dynamics. In the cross section, the excess supply of local-currency savings is the key determinant of low relative interest rates, negative covered and uncovered currency premia, cheap forward dollars; and vice versa. In the time series, covered currency premia change infrequently and in concert across currencies, driven by aggregate financial market conditions. In contrast, uncovered currency premia move frequently in response to currency-specific demand shocks, which we capture with the dynamics of net currency futures positions of dealer banks. Exchange rate depreciations in response to negative shifts in currency demand are followed by small persistent appreciations that generate predictable expected returns necessary to ensure intermediation of currency demand shocks, irrespective of their financial or macroeconomic origin. Changes in net futures positions of dealer banks account for most of the variation in the spot exchange rate for every currency.</content>

    <title>Motives and Constraints in the Implementation of Argentina’s 2017 Tax Reform</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the motives, constraints, and sequencing behind Argentina’s 2017 tax reform, drawing on the authors’ direct involvement in its design and implementation. We document how a large inherited fiscal imbalance, a disinflation program that mechanically raised real pension spending under the pre-existing indexation rule, minority status in Congress, and limited administrative capacity jointly narrowed the feasible policy set. Within those constraints, the reform aimed to be near-revenue-neutral while rebalancing the system toward investment and employment: phasing down corporate rates with dividend taxation and inflation adjustment, reducing the labor wedge at the bottom via a per-worker deduction, rationalizing VAT and excises (including carbon and health-motivated taxes), and coordinating with provinces to cap and de-cascade the turnover tax (ISIB) through a Fiscal Consensus. We trace how coalition politics and sectoral vetoes reshaped the package, why forward guidance and escape clauses were embedded ex ante, and how the 2018 sudden stop, followed by policy reversals, limited the reform’s realized growth dividend. We draw four lessons: credibility is a fiscal instrument; provincial coordination beats technocratic perfection; discretionary levers invite rent-seeking; and targeting informality and compliance margins yields higher returns than blunt rate changes. The analysis offers a pragmatic template for tax reform under macroeconomic fragility, federal fragmentation, and state-capacity constraints.</content>

    <title>People versus Places: Elite Persistence after the Fall of the Ming</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how elite power persisted through the Ming–Qing transition in Central China. Using genealogical microdata on married couples and their descendants, linked to measures of local elite influence, we estimate the effects of the Ming collapse (1368–1644) on families (people) and on regions (places). A family line-level treatment and control approach shows that elites experienced an immediate loss of influence, but their descendants recovered and consolidated elite status under the Qing (1644–1911). In contrast, a region-level design indicates that areas more heavily exposed to Ming-collapse destruction suffered persistent adverse outcomes. Evidence on career choice is consistent with a trauma-induced shift toward civil service examination careers, with stronger intergenerational transmission of exam-oriented norms in families more exposed to destruction. The results document adaptive persistence of elite families despite regime change, alongside lasting regional scarring, and highlight the role of cultural transmission in the persistence of elite status.</content>

    <title>Demand Elasticity in Dynamic Asset Pricing</title>

      <name>Zhiguo He, Péter Kondor &amp; Jessica S. Li</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Standard demand elasticity estimation treats investors' demand slopes as stable objects that can be traced out by exogenous residual supply shifts. We show this identification strategy fails in dynamic settings: supply shocks cause demand curves to tilt and shift through general equilibrium effects. The mechanism is intuitive—investors' demand depends on the entire distribution of current and future returns, including volatility, covariances, and correlations with investment opportunities. Supply shocks that change today's prices inevitably reshape future return distributions, moving the demand curve itself. We develop and calibrate a dynamic model to quantify this mismeasurement. The measured slope is approximately 40% of its conceptual counterpart, implying that demand curves are substantially steeper than estimated. This distortion operates through two channels: endogenous risk (altered volatility and covariances) and amplified intertemporal hedging (changed correlation with investment opportunities). The distortion remains sizable even for infinitesimal or purely transitory shocks.</content>

    <title>From Asia, With Skills</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the rise of high-skill migration from Asia to the United States over the past three decades and its consequences for both sending and receiving economies. Between 1990 and 2019, migrants from five Asian countries—India, China, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines—accounted for over one-third of the growth in US software developers and a quarter of the increase in scientists, engineers, and physicians. Drawing on census microdata, visa records, and administrative sources, I show how US demand for talent in information technology, higher education, and healthcare interacted with Asia’s demographic and educational transformations to generate this migration boom. Policy reforms (notably the H-1B, F-1, and J-1 visa programs) and sectoral shifts—such as the internet revolution, declining public support for universities, and aging-related healthcare demand—created persistent needs for foreign students and workers. Asian economies were uniquely positioned to meet this demand through rapid tertiary expansion, strong STEM institutions, English proficiency, and diaspora networks. These inflows boosted US innovation, entrepreneurship, and service-sector productivity while fostering “brain gain” and “brain circulation” in Asia. Together, these trends reveal how talent flows from Asia have become central to the structure and growth of the modern US economy.</content>

    <title>Probability Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops probability pricing, extending cash flow pricing to quantify the willingness-to-pay for changes in probabilities. We show that the value of any marginal change in probabilities can be expressed as a standard asset-pricing formula with hypothetical cash flows derived from changes in the survival function. This equivalence between probability and cash flow valuation allows us to construct hedging strategies and systematically decompose individual and aggregate willingness-to-pay. Four applications examine the valuation of changes in the distribution of aggregate consumption, the efficiency effects of varying performance precision in principal-agent problems, and the welfare implications of public and private information.</content>

    <title>The Roots of the Modern American Presidential Campaign</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Campaign tours have become an essential component of U.S. presidential elections. How and when did they begin? We explore the early history of in-person political campaigning in the United States by reconstructing the first presidential campaign tours from historical newspaper clippings. We analyze the decision to campaign, the determinants of where candidates campaigned, and the outcomes of early in-person campaigns. We document an evolving norm of campaigning. This norm evolved well after the expansion of the railroad network. While a national railroad network was a necessary precondition for campaigning to evolve, our findings point to other factors – such as growing urbanization and the decline of federal patronage machines – playing a more important role in the growth of campaigning. We find evidence that being visited on a campaign tour increased voter turnout in a county. However, we do not find a clear effect of campaign visits of a given candidate on his electoral performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article reviews the literature that uses survey data to study expectation formation among investors. We begin by outlining methods for eliciting investor beliefs and summarizing key empirical patterns documented in recent work. Highlighting the persistent cross-sectional heterogeneity in expectations, we then review evidence on the determinants of beliefs, including a new analysis of belief reactions to the tariff announcement in April 2025. Next, we examine how expectations shape financial decision-making, emphasizing the systematic but muted sensitivity of outcomes to belief changes. We conclude by pointing to promising directions for future research on belief measurement, the determinants of expectations, and their implications for policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do minimum wages affect informality? We study the near-doubling of the real minimum wage from 2000 to 2009 in Brazil, where 46% of the workforce is informal. Using labor force surveys covering the informal sector, we show the minimum wage exhibits near full passthrough to informal employees working in formal firms, about half of all informal employees. The formal-to-informal reallocation elasticity with respect to the formal-wage is small: -0.28. Our findings illustrate how minimum wages can positively affect living standards for workers thought beyond the reach of labor law, a sizable share of the workforce in developing economies.</content>

    <title>Complexity Theory and Economic Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the potential for complexity theory to produce insights that elucidate the evolution of socioeconomic inequality and point toward effective policies. We position complexity theory as a complement to more traditional economic approaches. Economic models of inequality can fall into four broad categories: models based on individual attributes and technologies, social interaction models, intergenerational models of transfer, and models of institutional and social structure. Within each of these categories, complexity theory can enhance traditional theory. It is of particular value in helping to distinguish between bottom-up systemic and top-down structural causes of inequality. Complexity theory can further enrich our understanding of economic inequality by adopting a complex adaptive system of systems approach in which economic, social, political, and psychosocial systems interact with one another and with institutional and social structures to produce robust inequality, particularly on racial lines.</content>

    <title>Social Dynamics of AI Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Anxiety about falling behind can drive people to embrace emerging technologies with uncertain consequences. We study how social forces shape demand for AI-based learning tools early in the education pipeline. In incentivized experiments with parents—key gatekeepers for children’s AI adoption—we elicit their demand for unrestricted AI tools for teenagers’ education. Parental demand rises with the share of other teenagers using the technology, with social forces increasing willingness to pay for AI by more than 60%. Providing information about potentially adverse effects of unstructured AI use negatively shifts beliefs about the merits of AI, but does not change individual demand. Instead, this information increases parents’ preference for banning AI in schools. Follow-up experiments show that social information has little effect on beliefs about AI quality, perceived skill priorities, or support for bans, suggesting that effects operate through social pressure rather than social learning. Our evidence highlights social pressure driving individual technology adoption despite widespread support for restricting its use.</content>

    <title>The Impact of State Paid Sick Leave Mandates on Medicaid-financed Prescription Medications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The United States lacks a federal paid sick leave policy. However, 18 states and the District of Columbia have adopted or announced paid sick leave employer mandates to increase access to this benefit, creating a quasi-experimental setting to study whether paid sick leave affects healthcare use. People enrolled in Medicaid are an important population to study in terms of state paid sick leave policies as the majority of non-disabled enrollees are employed, but frequently work in jobs without paid sick leave. Given enrollees’ lower incomes, losing earnings to receive healthcare may be a significant barrier to care. In this study, we examine the effect of state paid sick leave policies on Medicaid-financed dispensed prescription medications. Using difference-in-differences methods that are robust to bias associated with a staggered treatment rollout, we show that  Medicaid-financed dispensed prescription medications increase by 6.7% following adoption of a state paid sick leave policy. These findings suggest that state paid sick leave policies promote engagement with the healthcare system and use of healthcare services among financially constrained populations.</content>

    <title>Do Test Scores Misrepresent Test Results? An Item-by-Item Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Much of the data collected in education is effectively thrown away. Students answer individual test questions, but administrators and researchers only see aggregate performance. All the item-level data are lost. Ex ante it is not clear this destroys much useful information, since the aggregate might be a sufficient statistic. Using data from Texas for 5 million students and 1.31 billion student-item responses, we show that in fact aggregation does destroy a great deal of valuable information in education: (1) Even conditional on a summary test measure, there is additional information in the item-level data; (2) This additional information is relevant for the student outcomes that education decisions seek to optimize; and (3) This information can be made practically useful for schools. Given how inexpensive storing, transmitting and analyzing such data would be, large gains could be had in education by simply using all the data we currently collect.</content>

    <title>Branching Fixed Effects: A Proposal for Communicating Uncertainty</title>

      <name>Patrick M. Kline</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists often rely on estimates of linear fixed effects models developed by other teams of researchers. Assessing the uncertainty in these estimates can be challenging. I propose a form of sample splitting for network data that breaks two-way fixed effects estimates into statistically independent branches, each of which provides an unbiased estimate of the parameters of interest. These branches facilitate uncertainty quantification, moment estimation, and shrinkage. Algorithms are developed for efficiently extracting branches from large datasets. I illustrate these techniques using a benchmark dataset from Veneto, Italy that has been widely used to study firm wage effects.</content>

    <title>A Cold Stop: Temperature, Unemployment and Joblessness Dynamics</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide new evidence that short-run temperature shocks affect unemployment dynamics. Linking daily weather data with three decades of Current Population Survey microdata, we show that cold, but not hot, temperatures significantly increase unemployment risk. This effect is concentrated in climate-exposed industries and driven by both increased job separations and longer unemployment durations. Separations appear to be driven by a rise in layoffs rather than quits, while the increase in unemployment duration is largely explained by a decline in employer vacancy postings. Taken together, temperature-induced joblessness dynamics are primarily demand-driven, rather than a result of changes in worker behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chandler (1977) shows that large firms require hierarchies of white-collar workers to coordinate complex production. We document that this insight continues to hold globally today, and we show that low education levels in developing countries limit the supply of white-collar workers and constrain firm size. We extend the occupational choice model of Lucas (1978) to allow entrepreneurs to reorganize their firms by allocating administrative tasks to hired professionals, which brings the firm closer to constant returns to scale. We calibrate the model to be consistent with cross-sectional microdata and validate it using quasi-experimental and experimental evidence on the effects of educational expansions and management training interventions. Skills explain two-thirds of the reorganization of production into large firms with economic development, while structural transformation and reductions in barriers are needed to explain the remaining shift.</content>

    <title>Violent Peers at School: Impacts and Mechanisms</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of classroom exposure to peers with a history of violent behavior on academic achievement and the underlying mechanisms. This measure of peer violence departs significantly from earlier studies that measured potential peer violence based on the background characteristics of students. We exploit idiosyncratic treatment variations during the transition from primary to middle school for causal identification. We find that a higher proportion of violent peers negatively affects cognitive performance in tests in various subjects, particularly pronounced in mathematics and English, compared to Hebrew and science. These effects are more pronounced in girls than in boys. While boys’ performance is negatively influenced only by the presence of violent male peers, girls are adversely affected by both violent male and female peers. As for mechanisms, violent peers disrupt learning environments and lower teachers’ productivity, reflected in lower job satisfaction and perception of higher workloads. Violent peers also significantly increase the likelihood of other students engaging in physical fights, and reduce their homework time, especially for girls and students from low SES.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two robust empirical facts are that mean wages and cross-sectional wage dispersion both increase over the life cycle. We study how these two changes vary across occupations and document a strong positive correlation: occupations with high mean wage growth over the life cycle also exhibit greater increases in cross-sectional wage dispersion. We develop a novel dynamic Roy model that features both static and dynamic comparative advantage and show that it can account for the variation in life cycle wage distributions across high and low wage occupations. Dynamic comparative advantage reflects individual heterogeneity in occupation specific learning abilities and is the dominant force that shapes occupation choice in our model. We highlight several important implications of dynamic comparative advantage and show that our model captures the data better than a benchmark model that features persistent shocks.</content>

    <title>Taxing Identity</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joel Slemrod</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taxation based on identity has a long, often sordid history, and persists to this day, usually with some subtlety. It is a relatively tame cousin of the blatant, violent, and genocidal policies that have targeted people of certain religions, races, and genders for millennia. It is, nevertheless, an issue to be confronted rather than ignored by public finance economists. This is especially true because the concept of identity played a prominent role in the US presidential election of 2024, and is likely to be at least an undercurrent to the policy debates beginning in 2025, including those concerning tax policy. Tax based on identity is difficult, although not impossible, to justify within standard optimal tax analysis, because in that framework the policy objective is usually framed as being anonymous (impartial) and eschews basing policy on disparate preferences. The most promising justification seems to be if, for example, race is systematically correlated with the failure of income to represent ability to pay.  It then acts as a tag that can help achieve the desired allocation of tax burden at minimal efficiency cost. For unjustified identity-based tax policy, analysis can help to spot its existence and quantify its social welfare cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The GENIUS Act, recently signed into law, establishes a dual federal and state regulatory framework for stablecoins, effectively segmenting the USD stablecoin market into GENIUS-compliant stablecoins and those that are not. This paper discusses the use cases and potential benefits of stablecoins in terms of payment system efficiency and costs, as well as their substitutability with money market mutual funds and bank deposits. It then analyzes the financial stability risks associated with both GENIUS-compliant and unregulated stablecoins using empirical analysis and historical case studies. It concludes by discussing the economic implications of the emergence of a large dollar stablecoin ecosystem. The discussion is supported by a new survey of expert opinions canvassed through Large Language Model (LLM) analysis of all U.S. podcast episodes on stablecoins from January 20 to July 17, 2025.</content>

    <title>Portfolio Choice and Settlement Frictions: A Theory of Endogenous Convenience Yields</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study settlement frictions that arise from the need to finance negative balances through an over-the-counter (OTC) market. We derive a closed-form expression for the endogenous convenience yield and show how it can be incorporated into a canonical portfolio problem. Using this framework, we examine how shifts in settlement frictions affect liquidity premia, the volume of overnight funding, the dispersion of market rates, and optimal portfolio allocations. From a normative perspective, we show that in the competitive equilibrium, investors may either over- or under-invest in liquid assets; moreover, both higher risk aversion and tighter aggregate liquidity increase the likelihood of under-accumulation.</content>

    <title>A Note on Factors Influencing Trust in Government</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Responses to surveys eliciting evaluations of trust in government, both generally and in specific areas, have varied over time and across countries. Using consistent survey data for 34 OECD countries from 2007-2023, we estimate a model of factors determining levels of trust. We employ a series of econometric techniques of increasing sophistication. The level and growth rate of real income per capita, social spending per capita, the degree of decentralization, and economic freedom all exert positive effects on trust. Inflation, unemployment, and debt per capita negatively affect trust. Additionally, higher levels of human capital and the elderly share of the population negatively affect trust. In the context of trust in government, the estimates suggest a heavier weight on inflation than on unemployment when compared to Okun’s misery index, which weights them equally. Additionally, the estimates are used to evaluate combinations of policies, e.g. debt-financed increases in social spending that affect inflation and/or unemployment, to determine the net effect on trust in government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Continuation funds (CFs) are private equity structures in which a manager raises a new fund to purchase assets from their existing fund. This structure has surged in popularity, from five funds in 2018 to 130 in 2024. We use a hand-collected sample of 472 CFs to test a model in which heterogeneous preferences drive CFs. Consistent with the model’s predictions, CFs emerge when LPs are more heterogeneous and managers have earned carried interest that they can roll. LPs typically choose to exit rather than invest, with this decision driven by both LP-level frictions and time varying LP liquidity demands.</content>

    <title>Rating Government Procurement Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel, scalable method for assessing the quality of public procurement systems using standard administrative data. Our approach compares the distribution of procurement opportunities to the distribution of contract awards across firms. We first derive a simple theoretical benchmark that relates the expected distribution of contract value winning firms, measured as a Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), to the distribution of auction values, measured as a respective HHI, and the number of winning firms. Significant deviations of winning firms’ HHI from this benchmark indicate potential governance failures such as corruption or unchecked collusion. Our method requires no subjective input, is transparent and reproducible, and allows for meaningful comparisons across countries, industry sectors, and over time. We use procurement data from Ukraine and EU member states in 2018–2021 to assess the performance of five large sectors. Results indicate that Ukraine’s procurement performance in four of the five sectors is comparable to many other European countries. However, Ukraine’s construction sector consistently displays the largest excess concentration among all countries considered, consistent with anecdotal evidence of corruption in this sector. Overall, with minimal data requirements, our method offers a practical tool for cross-sector and cross-country assessment of procurement systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the labor market effects of recent state-level policies that require employers to disclose salary information in job postings. Leveraging a difference-in-differences design, we show that employers increased the fraction of postings with salary information by 30 percentage points. Across three datasets, we find consistent evidence of an increase in wages of 1.3-3.6%. We find no impacts on pay dispersion, employment, the number of postings, or skill and education requirements. Our evidence is consistent with pay transparency increasing competition in the labor market, leading to positive spillovers on incumbent workers and always-posting firms.</content>

    <title>Disentangling Sources of Variation in C-Section Rates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cesarean section rates vary widely across U.S. counties, yet it remains unclear how much of this variation reflects demand-side factors (such as patient risk or preferences) versus supply-side factors (such as physician practices or hospital incentives). We develop a new empirical strategy to isolate the influence of supply-side forces. Exploiting hospital obstetric unit closures from 1989–2019 that reallocate some mothers to counties with different C-section rates, we find that a one–percentage-point increase in the delivery county’s rate raises a mother’s likelihood of a C-section by roughly one point. The results point to a dominant role for provider behavior and local practice norms in driving geographic variation in C-section use, the most common major surgery in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document some underappreciated aspects of the recent evolution of the international reserve system. These include the growing share of gold in global central bank reserves, the continuing emergence of nontraditional reserve currencies, and the stalling share of renminbi in reserves. These trends are consistent with our findings in our earlier papers. In addition we look to the future, pondering the potential implications of dollar-linked stablecoins, the expansion of the BRICS grouping of countries and their de- dollarization plans, the development of blockchain-based platforms such as Project mBridge for the direct exchange of central bank digital currencies, and questions about the dollar’s safe-haven status.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This essay surveys the literature on middlemen—i.e., intermediation in exchange—reviewing, extending and consolidating key developments in the field. This is important because intermediated trade is common in reality but absent in standard general equilibrium theory. We focus on research using search theory. In various models, agents may act as middlemen when they are good at search, bargaining, recognizing quality, storing inventories, using credit, etc. The theory applies to markets for goods, inputs or assets. We discuss versions with indivisible or divisible goods, fixed or endogenous participation, stationary and dynamic equilibria, and some implications for efficiency and volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a step-by-step guide to leniency (a.k.a. judge or examiner instrument) designs, drawing on recent econometric literatures. The unbiased jackknife instrumental variables estimator (UJIVE) is purpose-built for leveraging exogenous leniency variation, avoiding subtle biases even in the presence of many decision-makers or controls. We show how UJIVE can also be used to assess key assumptions underlying leniency designs, including quasi-random assignment and average first-stage monotonicity, and to probe the external validity of treatment effect estimates. We further discuss statistical inference, arguing that non-clustered standard errors are often appropriate. A reanalysis of Farre-Mensa et al. (2020), using quasi-random examiner assignment to estimate the value of patents to startups, illustrates our checklist.</content>

    <title>The Race Between Asset Supply and Asset Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce an asset supply-and-demand approach to analyze the trajectory of US aggregate wealth, real interest rates, and fiscal sustainability. Our framework uses micro-founded and easy-to-implement sufficient statistics to quantify how shifts in demographics, inequality, and other forces affect asset market equilibrium. From 1950 to the present, rapid population aging, rising income inequality, increasing foreign demand for US assets, and declining productivity growth all contributed to a surge in asset demand. Asset supply initially fell, then turned around sharply, mainly driven by increases in government debt and the value of capitalized profits. Overall, asset demand won the race, and interest rates fell. Looking ahead to 2100, population aging will continue to strongly push up asset demand, but at current tax and benefit levels, asset supply will win the race, as rising entitlement costs push up government debt even more. While rising asset demand creates space for debt to eventually reach 250% of GDP without higher interest rates, stabilizing debt at any level requires a permanent fiscal adjustment of at least 10% of GDP.</content>

    <title>Internal vs. External Shocks in Weakening Democracies: Evidence on Migration and Foreign Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the consequences of regime change for both migration and foreign direct investment (FDI) by employing quasi-natural experiments that exploit external and internal shocks to democratic institutions. It compares evidence from Europe, which was afflicted by the “Syrian Shock”—an external institutional stress testing administrative and fiscal capacity—and Israel, which experienced the “Corruption Shock”—an internal credibility crisis that eroded judicial independence and policy predictability. These two shocks provide a natural experiment to examine how weakening democratic institutions influence both capital mobility and people mobility, using a unified econometric framework.
The analysis applies Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation to OECD panel data spanning 1995–2023 to isolate the causal effects of institutional deterioration on FDI inflows and migration flows. The DiD approach, complemented by fixed effects at the country and year levels, captures both the short-term disruptions caused by exogenous humanitarian pressures and the long-term persistence of governance-driven uncertainty. The results demonstrate that internal shocks—such as Israel’s judicial and corruption crises—generate large and durable declines in FDI and sustained outward migration, while external shocks—such as Europe’s refugee crisis—produce more transient effect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a large-scale randomized evaluation of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program in 531 Peruvian rural primary schools. We use administrative data on academic performance and grade progression over 10 years to estimate the long-run effects of increased computer access on (i) school performance over time and (ii) students’ educational trajectories. Following schools over time, we find no significant effects on academic performance but some evidence of negative effects on grade progression. Following students over time, we find no significant effects on primary and secondary completion, academic performance in secondary school, or university enrollment. Survey data indicate that computer access significantly improved students’ computer skills but not their cognitive skills; treated teachers received some training but did not improve their digital skills and showed limited use of technology in classrooms, suggesting the need for additional pedagogical support.</content>

    <title>Dilution vs. Risk Taking: Capital Gains Taxes and Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent proposals to tax unrealized capital gains or wealth have sparked a debate about their impact on entrepreneurship. We show that accrual-based taxation creates two opposing effects: successful founders face greater dilution from advance tax payments, whereas unsuccessful founders receive tax credits that effectively provide insurance. Using comprehensive new data on U.S. venture capital deals, we find that founder returns remain extremely skewed, with 84% receiving zero exit value while the top 2% capture 80% of total value. Moving from current realization-based to accrual-based taxation would reduce founder ownership at exit by 25% on average but would also increase the fraction receiving positive payoffs from 16% to 47% when tax credits are refunded. Embedding these distributions in a dynamic career choice model, we find that founders with no or moderate risk aversion prefer the current realization-based tax system, while more risk-averse founders prefer accrual-based taxation. We estimate that a 2% annual wealth tax has a similar impact on dilution as taxing unrealized capital gains but produces no risk-sharing benefits due to the absence of tax credits in case of down rounds.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the increasing divergence between economic growth and energy consumption through energy-saving technical progress. Proposing a new measure of energy-saving technology, we study the underlying drivers in a semi-structural model of the U.S. economy.  Our analysis shows that energy price shocks reduce consumption and stimulate energy-saving innovation, but also cause economic downturns and crowd out other innovations. Only energy-saving technology shocks can explain the negative co-movement between output and energy use. These sudden efficiency gains emerge as the primary driver of energy-saving technical change. Our findings highlight the importance of fostering energy-saving innovations in transitioning to a low-carbon economy.</content>

    <title>Shutting Down Japantown: The Effects of WWII Internment on Japanese American Enclaves</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During World War II, the U.S. government incarcerated all West Coast Japanese Americans in internment camps. We ask how this forced displacement affected Japanese American enclaves. Using the recently digitized 1940 and 1950 full-count censuses, we measure changes in the racial composition of neighborhoods across 14 major cities. We find that internment reduced the Japanese American population of enumeration districts within the exclusion zone by 25–50% relative to their 1940 levels, and that these individuals were replaced by African American in-movers in a nearly 1-to-1 fashion. Outside the exclusion zone, new Japanese American enclaves formed, but did not approach the scale of their historic West Coast counterparts.</content>

    <title>Target Allocation Funds, Strategic Complementarities, and Market Fragility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Target allocation funds (TAFs) make predictable rebalancing trades to maintain portfolio weights across asset classes. During the COVID-19 stock market crash, TAFs sold $59 billion of bond fund shares and simultaneously purchased a similar amount of equity fund shares. We show that TAF rebalancing triggers strategic complementarity: bond mutual funds facing larger rebalancing-induced sales by TAFs experienced greater outflows from other non-TAF investors. This effect was particularly pronounced for illiquid bond funds and amplified total bond fund outflows during COVID-19 by an additional $27 billion. Rebalancing by TAFs, together with the strategic amplification by other investors, transmits equity market shocks to bond returns, accounting for 17% of the rise in stock-bond correlation over the past decade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a new algorithm to map confidential firm-level export transactions to their underlying establishments that can be implemented on U.S. microdata. Using this procedure, we construct a novel micro-dataset of U.S. exports at the plant level. Aggregation of these data permits more accurate measurement of exporting at the subnational level (e.g., county, MSA, etc.) than was previously possible. The data reveal exports to be much more geographically concentrated than both employment and manufacturing sales, implying that some regions are heavily reliant on foreign demand. To illustrate the consequences of such exposure, we study the effects of the trade collapse during the Great Recession on local labor markets. Counties experiencing greater declines in foreign demand performed worse in terms of employment, pay, and wages during the Great Recession. A similar analysis implemented with publicly available imputed export data—a common practice in the literature—fails to replicate these estimates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study linear regressions in a context where the outcome of interest and some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets that cannot be matched. Traditional approaches obtain point identification by relying, often implicitly, on exclusion restrictions. We show that without such restrictions, coefficients of interest can still be partially identified, with the sharp bounds taking a simple form. We obtain tighter bounds when variables observed in both datasets, but not included in the regression of interest, are available, even if these variables are not subject to specific restrictions. We develop computationally simple and asymptotically normal estimators of the bounds. Finally, we apply our methodology to estimate racial disparities in patent approval rates and to evaluate the effect of patience and risk-taking on educational performance.</content>

    <title>Paternalistic Social Assistance: Evidence and Implications from Cash vs. In-Kind Transfers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate and compare impacts of cash and in-kind transfers on the consumption of temptation goods in the same population, and explore normative implications. We use two decades of data from South Carolina on cash benefits from Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and in-kind benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) linked to detailed data on adults’ health care use. Our empirical strategy examines outcome changes in the several days following each transfer’s scheduled monthly payout. Emergency department visits for drug and alcohol use increase by 20-30 percent following SSI receipt, but do not respond to SNAP receipt. Fills of prescription drugs for new illnesses also increase following SSI receipt but do not respond to SNAP receipt. Motivated by these non-fungibility results, we develop a model of a paternalistic social planner choosing the mix of cash and SNAP for a fixed-budget transfer program when consumers have self-control problems and may engage in mental accounting. We show that the planner’s optimal SNAP share is strictly positive and weakly increasing as self-control worsens. Moreover, with heterogeneity in self-control and mental accounting, the planner may choose to use SNAP even when they have access to a uniform Pigouvian tax on the temptation good.</content>

    <title>The Spatial Distribution of Income in Cities: New Global Evidence and Theory</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the spatial distribution of income and commuting patterns within cities vary across the development spectrum, drawing on new granular data from 50,000 neighborhoods in 121 cities across developed and developing countries. We document that in developing countries, poorer urban households are significantly more likely to live far from city centers, in hilly terrain, and near rivers. These patterns are absent or reversed in developed cities. Commuting shares decline more sharply with distance in less developed countries, indicating higher commuting costs that exacerbate spatial inequality in job access. Job-access measures are considerably worse for the urban poor than for the urban rich in developing countries, while the opposite is true in developed countries. We interpret these findings in a quantitative urban model and show that a parsimonious set of factors—nonhomothetic preferences over amenities, commuting costs, and the spatial concentration of jobs—helps explain most of the cross-country patterns we document.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The cost of error in many high-stakes settings is asymmetric: misdiagnosing pneumonia when absent is an inconvenience, but failing to detect it when present can be life-threatening. Accordingly, artificial intelligence (AI) models used to assist such decisions are frequently trained with asymmetric loss functions that incorporate human decision-makers' trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. In two focal applications, we show that this standard alignment practice can backfire. In both cases, it would be better to train the machine learning model with a loss function that ignores the human’s objective and then adjust predictions ex post according to that objective. We rationalize this result using an economic model of incentive design with endogenous information acquisition. The key insight from our theoretical framework is that machine classifiers perform not one but two incentivized tasks: choosing how to classify and learning how to classify. We show that while the adjustments engineers use correctly incentivize choosing, they can simultaneously reduce the incentives to learn. Our formal treatment of the problem reveals that methods embraced for their intuitive appeal can in fact misalign human and machine objectives in predictable ways.</content>

    <title>The Global Value of Cities</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the economic value of cities worldwide, using detailed job histories for 513 million workers in 220,000 cities across 191 countries. These estimates allow us to identify why some cities are more productive than others and to quantify the earnings gains from migration throughout the development process. Our data contain job spells—with start and end dates, establishment names, locations, job titles, and effective salaries—enabling an event-study movers design with individual and time fixed effects. Moving to higher-value cities leads to immediate increases in job seniority, shifts into better-paid industries and occupations, and large overall earnings gains. The global scope of the data lets us compare internal and international moves and assess how the productivity advantages of cities differ by country income level. Across borders, 93% of wage changes reflect city effects, while within countries this share ranges from 45–73%. High-income countries exhibit stronger ability-based sorting, reducing the proportion attributable to place. City effects rise with industrial diversity and population, consistent with agglomeration economies, and more productive cities allocate workers to higher-productivity firms. The wide dispersion of city effects within countries highlights substantial potential gains from migration, particularly in low-income, less-urbanized economies. Reallocating workers to match the US distribution yields sizable wage gains in developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use comprehensive tax data to study how saving behavior responds to the Health Savings Account (HSA) “catch-up” contribution provision, which raises HSA contribution limits for individuals aged 55 and older. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find a sharp increase in contributions among those previously near the limit and smaller increases among unconstrained savers. Induced contributions are not immediately withdrawn and do not appear to crowd out retirement savings. Responses are strongest among payroll contributors and long-term savers. However, married couples do not appear to coordinate their HSA behavior to take advantage of the complex spousal rules governing catch-up contributions. Our findings highlight how tax incentives shape HSA saving and suggest that tax-advantaged account design meaningfully affects household financial behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use high-frequency retail microdata to measure the short-run impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs on consumer prices. By matching daily prices from major U.S. retailers to product-level tariff rates and countries of origin, we construct price indices that isolate the direct effects of tariff changes across goods and trading partners. Prices began rising immediately after the broader tariff measures announced in early March and continued to increase gradually over subsequent months, with imported goods rising roughly twice as much as domestic ones. Our estimated retail tariff pass-through is 20 percent, with a cumulative contribution of about 0.7 percentage points to the all-items Consumer Price Index by September 2025. Our results show that tariff costs were gradually but steadily transmitted to U.S. consumers, with additional spillovers to domestic goods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct representative security-fund-level longitudinal data for the United States using regulatory filings of portfolio holdings from Form N-PORT. We validate our dataset by comparing coverage and composition to official statistics from the Federal Reserve’s Financial Accounts of the United States (formerly known as the Flow of Funds) and Treasury International Capital (TIC) System, and to micro-level commercial datasets. We showcase an application by replicating and updating Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2020) findings on home currency bias using N-PORT instead of commercial fund holdings data. Our results confirm that N-PORT data offer a comprehensive, reliable, and public source for research in macroeconomics and finance. We make all the security-level data on holdings available in a public repository of the GCAP Lab and provide code for updating the data.</content>

    <title>The Logic of State Surveillance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;All states adopt systems to surveil political activists. How do they decide whom to watch and why? We study the logic of state surveillance using the first complete individual-level database of those monitored by a state — 152,000 Italians born between 1816 and 1932, encompassing both democratic and authoritarian regimes. We focus on education: exploiting a discontinuous expansion in primary schooling in municipalities above a population and age threshold, we show that cohorts exposed to more years of school experienced an uptick in surveillance. The effect is largest for working classes, who were monitored for longer periods, subjected to harsher measures, and disproportionately targeted when affiliated with communist ideologies. Yet treated cohorts did not become more politically active, indicating that surveillance expanded not in reaction to increased mobilization, but as a preventive strategy rooted in fears of working-class empowerment. These findings reveal how states view educated yet excluded groups as politically threatening and prioritize their surveillance, potentially generating inequalities in groups' ability to influence political change.</content>

    <title>Beliefs and Portfolios: Causal Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We causally test alternative theories of expectation formation. Using a randomized information experiment we show overreaction is a key feature of individuals' return expectations, and individuals' response to the price-earnings ratio is opposite to the academic consensus. Our evidence is inconsistent with standard models of expectation formation but subjective mental models that deviate from objective benchmarks can jointly explain the updating behavior in the experiment, the link between individuals' prior perceptions and expectations, and the heterogeneity of updating. Conditional on their beliefs, individuals' sensitivity of equity shares in a hypothetical portfolio choice experiment is consistent with the standard Merton model.</content>

    <title>Malleable Minds: The Effects of STEM- vs. Humanities-Focused Curricula</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impacts of assignment to STEM vs. humanities-focused curricula in Romania’s high school system. We apply a regression discontinuity design to administrative and survey data to estimate effects on educational pathways, desired careers, and non-cognitive outcomes. An overarching theme of our findings is the malleability of students to what they study. Assignment to STEM increases STEM college enrollment and technology or engineering career intentions by 25 pp. Exploring mechanisms, we find that STEM assignment changes students’ self-perceived academic abilities and their preferences over academic subjects and job tasks. STEM assignment is risky for low-achieving students, reducing their chances of passing a high school exit exam and enrolling in college. A final finding is that STEM makes boys more conservative, while shifting some of girls' views to the left. Our results identify a strategy for promoting STEM higher education and careers, but also highlight potential tradeoffs.</content>

    <title>The Social Rate of Return on Road Infrastructure Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A billion people live more than two kilometers from an all-season road, the vast majority of whom reside in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), where the absence of paved roads hinders growth and development. Consistent with this shortage, we estimate that the median social rate of return to installing an additional kilometer of two-lane highway in EMDEs is 55 percent—roughly eight times the social rate of return on private capital in the US. The size and precision of the estimates vary widely across countries. But the eightfold excess social return on roads is, nevertheless, five times larger than the excess financial return on stocks in developing countries that once catalyzed the creation of emerging market equity as an asset class. The absolute and relative magnitudes of these excess returns thus suggest the possibility of substantial unrealized gains from reallocating developed-country savings toward public capital formation in EMDEs. We document these facts using a production function approach to estimate each country’s marginal product of public capital (MPX). We then pair these estimates with country-specific, hedonic road-construction prices (Px) from the Roads Cost Knowledge System to compute social rates of return (Rx). Because macro estimates face well-known identification and measurement challenges, we interpret our findings alongside complementary evidence on financial and micro-level returns.</content>

    <title>An Anatomy of the Great Reallocation in US Supply Chain Trade</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents stylized facts about the "Great Reallocation" in US supply chain trade following the 2018–2019 tariff shocks and the April 2025 Liberation Day announcements. We find that: (i) The US has decoupled from China but not from the world overall. (ii) US imports diversified mainly among its top-20 partners, rather than expanding to new source countries. (iii) Local linear projections confirm ongoing declines in China's import shares, with compensating increases from Vietnam, Mexico, and Taiwan. (iv) Most of this shift occurred along the product-level intensive margin, though extensive margin adjustments became more pronounced for Vietnam and India from 2021-2024. (v) After a period of "wait and see", the decline in import shares from China spread to contract-intensive and relationship-sticky goods by 2021-2024. (vi) Early 2025 data suggest that trade reallocation has already accelerated after Liberation Day, in favor of trade partners facing lower additional tariffs and with geographically proximate supply networks. Together, these findings show that the US-China tariff shocks have unwound the US' sourcing from China back to where it stood at the time of China's WTO accession.</content>

    <title>The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications: Comment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;De Loecker et al. (2020)  (DEU) estimate that markups increased significantly in the United States from 1955 to 2016. We find this result is sensitive to unreported sample restrictions that drop 27% of the available observations. Applying the methodology as described in the article to the full sample, markup increases are more muted until late in the sample period, and are almost entirely driven by Finance and Insurance firms. If these firms are removed, markup increases are modest. We conclude that the DEU methodology and data, as they are described in the article, do not support the conclusion that broad-based increases in market power have occurred in recent decades.

This paper was motivated by an earlier NBER working paper.  The authors of that paper have posted a response to this paper. The authors of this paper have prepared a rejoinder to the response.</content>

    <title>The Lending Technology of Direct Lenders in Private Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare the lending technology of direct lenders, banks, and finance companies using a unique data set on secured borrowing by the universe of U.S.-based private middle market firms. The borrowers of direct lenders are distinct relative to those of traditional lenders; they are younger, more likely to be in intangible capital industries, and more likely to be located in the biggest cities in the United States. These differences reflect the focus of direct lenders on private equity-owned firms; direct lenders have negligible impact in industries and cities with low private equity presence. The lending technology of direct lenders is distinct from banks: they have almost no branch network, they are geographically distant from borrowers, they write collateral claims more focused on the continuation value of firms after a default, and they have a higher degree of specialization in certain industries. Direct lenders and private equity sponsors match on industry specialization more strongly than geographic proximity. The findings suggest that direct lenders are not a general substitute for traditional lenders in middle market business lending, but they are instead specialized lenders focused on a particular segment of the U.S. economy with a distinct lending technology.</content>

    <title>Forecasting Social Science: Evidence from 100 Projects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Forecasts about research findings affect critical scientific decisions, such as what treatments an R&amp;D lab invests in, or which papers a researcher decides to write. But what do we know about the accuracy of these forecasts? We analyze a unique data set of all 100 projects posted on the Social Science Prediction Platform from 2020 to 2024, which received 53,298 forecasts in total, including 66 projects for which we also have results. We show that forecasters, on average, over-estimate treatment effects; however, the average forecast is quite predictive of the actual treatment effect. We also examine differences in accuracy across forecasters. Academics have a slightly higher accuracy than non-academics, but expertise in a field does not increase accuracy. A panel of motivated repeat forecasters has higher accuracy, but this does not extend more broadly to all repeat forecasters. Confidence in the accuracy of one's forecasts is perversely associated with lower accuracy. We also document substantial cross-study correlation in accuracy among forecasters and identify a group of "superforecasters". Finally, we relate our findings to results in the literature as well as to expert forecasts.</content>

    <title>Who Bears the Burden of Climate Inaction?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change is already increasing temperatures and raising the frequency of natural disasters in the United States. In this paper, we examine several major vectors through which climate change affects US households, including cost increases associated with home insurance claims and increased cooling, as well as sources of increased mortality. Although we consider only a subset of climate costs over recent decades, we find an aggregate annual cost averaging between $400 and $900 per household; in 10 percent of counties, costs exceed $1,300 per household. Costs vary significantly by geography, with the largest costs occurring in some western regions of the United States, the Gulf Coast, and Florida. Climate costs also typically disproportionately burden lower-income households. Our work suggests the importance of research that looks beyond rising temperatures to extreme weather events; so far, natural disasters account for the bulk of the burden of climate change in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using transaction-level data on US congressional stock trades, we find that lawmakers who later ascend to leadership positions perform similarly to matched peers beforehand but outperform them by 47 percentage points annually after ascension. Leaders’ superior performance arises through two mechanisms. The political influence channel is reflected in higher returns when their party controls the chamber, sales of stocks preceding regulatory actions, and purchase of stocks whose firms receiving more government contracts and favorable party support on bills. The corporate access channel is reflected in stock trades that predict subsequent corporate news and greater returns on donor-owned or home-state firms.</content>

    <title>Effects of WIC on Birth Outcomes: Evidence from Newly Digitized Data from the National Archives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the effect of nutrition—delivered during pregnancy via the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)—on infant health. We contribute to the literature by adding new data on WIC rollout from the National Archives, employing novel methods, investigating new mechanisms, and analyzing previously unexplored infant outcomes, including the distribution of birth weight. We find robust evidence that access to WIC in a woman’s county of residence by the start of their second trimester led to a reduction in the probability of an infant being of low birth weight and to a higher average birth weight, with larger in magnitude effects for infants with Black mothers than for those with White mothers. Our results suggest a lower bound for treatment-on-the-treated effects for low birth weight of -0.9 percentage points and for birth weight of around 33 grams for infants with Black mothers, both economically significant. For White mothers, the effects on low birth weight are much smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant. These findings show WIC reduced overall disparities between Blacks and Whites in low birth weight by 3.6 percent.</content>

    <title>Information Acquisition By Mutual Fund Investors: Evidence from Stock Trading Suspensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mutual funds create liquidity for investors by issuing demandable equity shares while holding illiquid securities. We study the implications of this liquidity creation by examining frequent trading suspensions in China, which temporarily eliminate market liquidity in affected stocks. These suspensions cause significant mispricing of mutual funds due to inaccurate valuations of their illiquid holdings. We find that investors actively acquire information about suspended stocks held by mutual funds, driving flows into underpriced funds. This information is subsequently incorporated into stock prices when trading resumes. Our findings suggest that mutual fund liquidity creation stimulates information acquisition about illiquid, information-sensitive assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Suicide rates among older adults have been rising over time in the United States.  At the same time, more individuals have been suffering with chronic pain and illness, which are often underlying risk factors for suicide.  As self-medication with marijuana has become common, we ask whether access to legal marijuana for medical and recreational purposes reduces suicides rates among older individuals.  We find that suicide rates among older age groups decline following the opening of recreational marijuana dispensaries, especially among older Whites, and middle-aged White males and females with low levels of education.</content>

    <title>Unanticipated Effects of Electronic Benefits Transfer on WIC Stores and Redemptions: Evidence from Administrative Data on Vendors</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effects of the nationwide transition in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) from paper vouchers to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on store decisions to seek authorization to accept WIC benefits. We combine novel administrative data from “The Integrity Profile” (USDA administrative data on stores participating in WIC and their WIC reimbursements) with new nationwide policy data on WIC EBT implementation. Using a staggered adoption difference-in-differences approach, we find that the transition had heterogeneous and occasionally unanticipated effects across states. The number of WIC authorized independent vendors declined 10% following WIC EBT implementation. We find no significant effect of WIC EBT implementation on WIC redemptions in a subset of ZIP Codes with sufficient vendors for data sharing. Vendors in states that were early adopters of WIC EBT have more negative effects on the probability of WIC authorization, which may be due to learning effects or improvements in technology over time. Past experience with EBT implementation by financial services providers hired by states to help them implement WIC EBT processing (processors) reduces the magnitude of these negative effects of EBT implementation on store participation in WIC.</content>

    <title>A Sufficient Statistics Approach to Optimal Corporate Taxes</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper characterizes the equity–efficiency tradeoff of corporate taxation using a stylized model that draws on the corporate investment and tax incidence literatures. We derive optimal corporate tax formulas in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities and welfare weights on workers and firm owners. While much empirical work emphasizes investment responses, these elasticities do not feature in optimal tax formulas. The elasticity of taxable profits is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency costs of the corporate tax. Higher corporate tax rates are desirable when firm owners have low welfare weights, and less desirable when taxing profits reduces wages. These empirical objects remain central across extensions, including heterogeneous production technologies, tax sheltering, international capital mobility, monopsony, and linear labor income taxes. We survey the empirical literature and find that existing estimates can support a wide range of optimal tax rates. An inverse-optimum analysis provides combinations of welfare weights of workers and firm owners that would rationalize the post-2017 US corporate tax cut as optimal.</content>

    <title>Ambiguity vs. Risk in Investment Decisions: An Illustration from Green Finance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) or risk provide a greater discouragement to investment? There is general agreement in the financial press that uncertainty discourages investment, with uncertainty here meaning any situation where important future policy variables (such as tariffs or tax rates) are not known. And it seems intuitively plausible that situations of ambiguity are “more uncertain” than those of risk: under risk, although the outcome is not known, its expected value is, whereas under ambiguity we have a distribution of possible expected values. In this paper we show that under quite general circumstances it is the case that ambiguity deters investment more than an equivalent risk. An equivalent risk is one characterized by a compound lottery reflecting the ambiguous situation, but without ambiguity aversion. We show that there will always be investments opportunities that are rejected when characterized by ambiguity but are accepted when characterized by risk with an equivalent compound lottery, and that the converse is not true: there are no investments that would be made under ambiguity that would not be made under equivalent risk. We develop the analysis in the context of the emerging field of green finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the trauma associated with exposure to racial violence affect economic outcomes? We study this question in the context of lynchings of Black citizens in the American South between 1880 and 1940 and provide systematic evidence of long-run economic impacts of that violence for the broader community and the effects’ persistence across generations. First, using data on averted lynchings and matched placebos as counterfactuals, we show that children indirectly exposed to the racial trauma of lynchings (proxied by close proximity to the victim’s household location) exhibit a reduction in occupational income score and likelihood of holding a white collar occupation, in their prime earning years as adults. We also observe intergenerational effects: children of the individuals who were exposed (as children) to lynchings see, as adults observed in 1940, a reduction in their income relative to counterfactual individuals. By documenting long-run and intergenerational economic effects of exposure to lynchings, we add empirical evidence to an interdisciplinary literature that identifies racial trauma as a distinctive and durable form of psychological harm.</content>

    <title>Moving to Fluidity: Regional Growth and Labor Market Churn</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the connection between regional growth trends and labor market dynamics. New data on manufacturing worker flows for U.S. cities 1969-1981 show more new hires and more voluntary quits in growing cities, but more forced layoffs in shrinking cities. Recessions are special in growing cities in that hires and quits drop, whereas in shrinking cities layoffs rise. A quantitative business cycle model with migration and on-the-job search accounts for a large share of variation in growth and worker flows both over time and across space. Growing cities in the South and West had low job creation costs and only gradual in-migration, so tight labor markets encouraged more on-the-job search. In those cities, aggregate job destruction shocks generated recessions with lower labor market churn. In the shrinking cities of the Rust Belt, in contrast, churn was always low and responded little in recessions.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Widespread Online Education on Market Structure and Enrollment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the rapid expansion of Brazil's private online higher-education sector and its effects on market structure and college enrollment. Exploiting regional and field-specific variation in online education penetration, we find that online programs expand access for older students but divert younger students from higher-quality in-person programs. Greater competition lowers tuition prices but also reduces the supply of in-person degrees. Using an equilibrium model of college education, we show that in the absence of online programs, total enrollment would be 14 percent lower, while in-person enrollment would rise by 33 percent. On net, aggregate labor-market value added declines by 1.4 percent. Online education raises value added for older students, who benefit from increased access, but lowers it for younger students, who shift toward lower-return online options. Counterfactual policies that restrict online enrollment to older cohorts could increase value added for younger students without reducing gains for older cohorts.</content>

    <title>Good Data and Bad Data: The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how a monopolist’s use of consumer data for price discrimination affects welfare. To answer this question, we develop a model of market segmentation subject to residual uncertainty. We fully characterize when data usage monotonically increases or decreases welfare or when the effect is non-monotone. The characterization reduces the problem to one with only two demand curves, and gives a condition for the two-demand-curves case that highlights that information affects welfare in three distinct ways. In the non-monotone case, we provide tight bounds on the welfare effects of information and identify the best local direction for providing additional information.</content>

    <title>Labor Market Strength and Declining Community College Enrollment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Declining U.S. college enrollments over the past 15 years have triggered questions about the health of the postsecondary sector. Using institution-level data, we make four points. First, such declines are driven not by the four-year sector but by two-year community colleges, which have apparently shrunk by over 30% since the peak of the Great Recession. Second, over one-third of this apparent decline is an artifact of some community colleges being reclassified as offering four-year degrees. Third, pre-Great Recession data shows a 1 percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate increases first-time community college enrollment by 2 percent, suggesting many students are on the margin between community college and job opportunities. For-profit college enrollments are similarly countercyclical, while public and private four-year college enrollments appear acyclical. Our estimates suggest that strengthening labor markets explain about 60% of the post-Great Recession decline in first-time community college enrollment. Fourth, students whose enrollment decisions are most sensitive to labor market conditions appear unlikely to have completed a degree. Though declining community college enrollments are a challenge for postsecondary institutions, it is less clear whether they signal a problem for students on the margin of enrollment.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Guaranteed Basic Income on Crime Perpetration and Victimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first experimental evidence on the impact of providing a guaranteed basic income on criminal perpetration and victimization. We analyze a nationwide randomized controlled trial that provided 2,000 unemployed individuals in Finland with an unconditional monthly payment of 560 Euros for two years (2017-2018), while 173,222 comparable individuals remained under the existing social safety net. Using comprehensive administrative data on police reports and district court trials, we estimate precise zero effects on criminal perpetration and victimization. Point estimates are small and statistically insignificant across all crime categories. Our confidence intervals rule out reductions in perpetration of 5 percent or more for crime reports and 10 percent or more for criminal charges.</content>

    <title>Africa as a Success Story: Political Organization in Pre-Colonial Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an overview of the explanations for the relative lack of state formation historically in Africa. In doing so we systematically document for the first time the extent to which Africa was politically decentralized, calculating that in 1880 there were probably 45,000 independent polities which were rarely organized on ethnic lines. At most 2% of these could be classified as states. We advance a new argument for this extreme political decentralization positing that African societies were deliberately organized to stop centralization emerging. In this they were successful. We point out some key aspects of African societies that helped them to manage this equilibrium. We also emphasize how the organization of the economy was subservient to these political goals.</content>

    <title>Delivering Higher Pay? The Impacts of a Task-Level Pay Standard in the Gig Economy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does a task-level minimum pay requirement for gig workers affect their earnings and employment? We study this question in the context of a January 2024 law in Seattle that establishes a per-task minimum pay standard for app-based delivery workers. Drawing on novel cross-platform, trip-level gig activity data, we compare earnings and employment trajectories around the implementation of the law for workers who were doing delivery work in Seattle before the reform against workers who had been active in other regions of Washington State. We find that the minimum pay law raised delivery pay per task, though the increases in base pay per task were partially offset by a substantial reduction in average tips, a major component of delivery pay. At the same time, the policy led to a reduction in the number of tasks completed by highly attached incumbent drivers (but not an increase in exit from delivery work), completely offsetting increased pay per task and leading to zero effect on monthly earnings. We find evidence that drivers experienced more unpaid idle time and longer distances driven between tasks, but find no evidence that drivers reduced their total time working on delivery apps and only limited evidence of switching from delivery to ride-hailing work. Using a simple model of the labor market for platform delivery drivers, we show that our evidence is consistent with free entry of drivers into the delivery market driving down the task-finding rate until expected earnings return to their pre-reform level. These findings highlight the challenges of raising pay in spot markets for tasks where there is free entry of workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise in nicotine vaping among U.S. teenagers in the late 2010s prompted tobacco control advocates to press for higher electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) taxes to curb their use. This study is the first to explore how the effectiveness of e-cigarette taxation as an anti-vaping policy tool has evolved over time. Using data from several nationally representative data sources and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find that since 2020, the effectiveness of a one dollar increase in ENDS taxes in curbing youth nicotine vaping has declined by over 50 percent. This finding is consistent with the marginal youth vaper becoming more tax inelastic over time. Descriptive evidence shows that the composition of youth ENDS users appears to have shifted toward those with a higher addictive stock and a greater taste for risk, which could make youths less tax responsive. For adults, where nicotine vaping rates are stable or slightly rising and compositional shifts are somewhat less pronounced, we find much less evidence that ENDS tax effectiveness has changed over time.</content>

    <title>Waiting for the Right Offer: Laboratory Evidence on How News Affects Bargaining</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a series of laboratory experiments that implement the Daley and Green (2020) model to examine whether the gradual, exogenous revelation of sellers’ private information influences the occurrence of trades in a bilateral bargaining setting with a static lemon condition. We find that while information does not increase efficiency, it reduces the likelihood that buyers incur losses when trading with low-quality sellers. Anticipating that additional signals will arrive, buyers hesitate to finalize deals immediately and exhibit a “waiting for news” effect, making sizable offer adjustments only when sufficient positive signals have accumulated. In contrast, informed sellers are less sensitive to news but appear to wait for the offer that they deem acceptable.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Paid Sick Leave Mandates on Individuals with Disabilities: Evidence from Social Security Disability Claims</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid sick leave mandates (PSLs), which have been adopted by 18 states and the District of Columbia, require employers to provide regular wages when workers take short-term leave for their own or a family member’s medical needs. This study is the first to explore the effects of PSL adoption on participation in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, as well as the health of persons with disabilities. We find that statewide PSLs are associated with a 6-9 percent increase in initial claims for SSI and joint SSI/SSDI benefits. These applications translate to an increase in beneficiaries, strongest among children under age 18. An exploration of the primary mechanisms likely underlying this result reveals PSL-induced (1) increases in time spent offering informal caregiving of those with disabilities, which may reduce the costs of applying to SS(D)I programs, and (2) increases in health care utilization among children with disabilities. Evidence for negative work hours effects of PSLs is weaker, concentrated among spouses of persons with disabilities. Finally, we find that PSL mandates lead to modest improvements in health among both children and adults with disabilities.</content>

    <title>Medicaid Coverage and Postpartum Opioid Use Disorder Treatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women in the United States has risen more than fourfold since 1999, making substance use a leading cause of maternal mortality. Medicaid finances the majority of births and substance use disorder treatment in the U.S., yet until recently, coverage typically ends 60 days postpartum, potentially disrupting care continuity. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 extends postpartum Medicaid coverage from two months to 12 months, creating a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of coverage on access to medications for OUD (MOUD), the gold-standard treatment. We use linked nationwide all-payer medical and retail pharmacy claims from IQVIA in a difference-in-differences framework comparing postpartum MOUD continuity between Medicaid- and commercially-insured parents with a prenatal history of MOUD use. Extended Medicaid postpartum coverage increases Medicaid-financed MOUD months by 8.55%, the likelihood of continuing MOUD beyond 60 days by 5.12%, and total MOUD supply days by 7.99%. These gains are slightly offset by other payer reductions, yet result in a net 5.10% increase in overall MOUD months and 4.64% rise in treatment adherence. Findings highlight the importance of coverage duration as a practical lever to sustain MOUD treatment in the crucial first year after delivery period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building a cohesive nation-state amid deep ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity is a central challenge for many governments. This paper examines the process of nation building, drawing lessons from the remarkable experience of Indonesia over the past century. I discuss conceptual perspectives on nation building and review Indonesia's historical nation-building trajectory. I then synthesize insights from four studies exploring distinct policy interventions in Indonesia---population resettlement, administrative unit proliferation, land reform, and mass schooling---to understand their effects on social cohesion and national integration. Together, these cases underscore the promise and pitfalls of nation-building efforts in diverse societies, offering guidance for future research and policymaking to support these endeavors in Indonesia and beyond.</content>

    <title>Moral Regulation and Cultural Production: Evidence from Hollywood</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Moral regulation is widespread across societies, yet its consequences have seldom been examined empirically. We study the Hays Code (July 1934–1960s), which imposed systematic moral guidelines on American cinema. Using a regression-discontinuity design, with non-U.S. films providing a comparison group, we find that the moral compliance of U.S. films rose sharply after 1935 and remained high for two decades. The Code also reshaped protagonists and political tone: protagonists became less likely to be women or working class, and political tones grew more conservative. Filmmakers adapted both by increasing compliance within genres and by shifting across them: less-compliant Drama declined while more-compliant Western and Action rose. Companies with a larger market size and immigrant film directors exhibited stronger responses. These findings reveal how moral constraint, market, and identity jointly shape cultural production and how well-intentioned moral regulation can generate broad and often unintended spillovers.</content>

    <title>Financial Returns to Equity Investments in Infrastructure in Emerging-Market and Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the scarcity of infrastructure in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), in the absence of readily accessible data on the historical performance of EMDE infrastructure as an asset class, private investors are reluctant to finance infrastructure projects in these countries. We begin to fill this information gap by computing the financial returns from equity investments in primarily unlisted firms in EMDEs made by the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group. The public market equivalent of 266 equity investments in core infrastructure by the IFC, with starting dates from 1961 to March 2020, was 1.17 using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark, and 1.26 using the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. On average, over the past six decades, equity stakes in emerging-market infrastructure backed by the IFC thus delivered higher returns than investments in portfolios of publicly listed equities. Data from the full sample of IFC equity investments reveal that, on average, a diversified portfolio of investments in infrastructure-related sectors, and indeed, in all sectors more generally, generated significant positive financial returns, albeit with variation across decades.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how differences in financial reporting practices shape firm productivity. Leveraging new audit questions in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), and complementary tax return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and detailed financial records from Sageworks, we find that (i) variation in reporting quality explains 10--20 percent of intra-industry total factor productivity dispersion, and (ii) evidence of complementarity between the effects of financial audits and management practices driving firm productivity. We then examine the underlying mechanisms. First, audits function as a managerial technology, improving the precision of internal information and raising efficiency, with stronger effects in competitive, low-margin industries and among younger firms. Second, exploiting cross-state variation in tax incentives, we show that audits constrain underreporting and mitigate the downward bias in measured productivity. Together, these results highlight the underrated importance of financial reporting quality driving firm productivity.</content>

    <title>Imputation-Powered Inference for Missing Covariates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Missing covariate data is a prevalent problem in empirical research. We provide a novel framework for handling missing covariate data for estimation and inference in downstream tasks. Our general framework provides an automatic and easy-to-use pipeline for empirical researchers: First, missing values are imputed using virtually any imputation method under general observation patterns. Second, we automatically correct for the imputation bias and adaptively weight the imputed values according to their quality. Third, we use all available data, including imputed observations, to obtain more precise point estimates for the downstream task with valid confidence intervals. Our approach ensures valid inference while improving statistical efficiency by leveraging all available data. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under general missing data patterns and a broad class of imputation methods. Through simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over natural benchmarks, as it achieves both lower bias and variance while being robust to imputation quality. In a comprehensive empirical study of the dependence of equity markets on carbon emissions, we show that properly accounting for missing emissions data yields no evidence of correlation between stock returns and emissions directly produced by companies, but a negative correlation with value chain emissions.</content>

    <title>A Model of the Model: Unpacking CGE Results on Carbon Leakage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Computational general equilibrium (CGE) models can evaluate detailed tax reforms, trade restrictions, or environmental policy. These models can capture many complexities, but these complexities can make results difficult to interpret. Analytical general equilibrium (AGE) models provide better intuition and interpretation but cannot capture relevant complexities. We propose a method that employs AGE models to understand CGE models – a “model of the model”. We apply this idea to climate policy and carbon leakage – the increase in emissions elsewhere. Our AGE models identify seven key economic determinants of leakage within any one outcome. We then unpack results from three existing CGE models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Have recent tariffs resulted in increased costs for the US healthcare system? We examine US trade data and compile a database of statutory tariff changes. Tariffs on medical goods narrowly defined resulted in $3.4 Billion in duties assessed between February and July 2025—more than 10 times the same period in 2024, with a 55.8 percent rate of pass-through at the US border. We estimate that had medical goods imports observed in 2024 been subject to the statutory tariff levels prevailing in August 2025, assessed duties would have been $15.8 Billion, almost 30 times higher than those observed in real-time. Our aggregates understate imports of medical goods and other imports used in healthcare settings, as data limitations compel us to omit purchases of imported goods for construction, maintenance, and operations of facilities, as well as imports under certain HS10 and HS6 tariff codes that are used when identifying medical goods in many contexts but contain a mixture of imports for medical and non-medical purposes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How has aggregate income and welfare in the United States been affected by globalization and rapid productivity growth in emerging economies? We use the class of constant elasticity trade models to provide quantitative evidence on these questions. We find that reductions in worldwide trade frictions over the period from 1960-2020 reduced the share of the United States in global GDP but raised its aggregate welfare. Similarly, productivity growth in Japan and China led to a decline in the relative income of the United States, but brought aggregate welfare gains from the resulting expansion in global production possibilities. Trade integration and foreign productivity growth have relatively modest effects on domestic income and welfare compared to domestic productivity growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Take-up of means-tested transfer programs in the United States remains incomplete despite their substantial value to eligible households. We contribute to the literature on determinants of program participation by providing the first causal estimates of how proximity to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offices affects program participation. Using administrative data on SNAP receipt in a single state linked to geocoded office locations, we exploit quasi-experimental variation from frequent office openings and closings. Event study estimates show that SNAP participation in a census tract decreases following the closure of an office by 7–9 percent over two years, with suggestive evidence of increases in participation following office openings. These effects are concentrated in urban areas and are robust to alternative specifications and tests of endogeneity in changes in office placement.</content>

    <title>How (Not) to Identify Demand Elasticities in Dynamic Asset Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate approaches to estimating demand elasticities in dynamic asset markets, both theoretically and empirically. We establish strict, necessary conditions that the dynamics of instrumented asset price variation must satisfy for valid identification. We illustrate these insights in a general equilibrium model of dynamic trade and derive the magnitude of biases that arise when these conditions are violated. Estimates based on static IO models are severely biased when the instrumented price variation is persistent or predictable. Empirically, we show that commonly used instruments yield elasticity estimates that are off by orders of magnitude, or even have the wrong sign. In contrast to standard multiplier calculations, our theory characterizes the dynamic asset market interventions required to sustain a given price path support process, with direct implications for policies such as Quantitative Easing (QE).</content>

    <title>California’s Firearm Excise Tax is Almost Fully Passed on to Consumers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effect of California's 11 percent excise tax on firearms, introduced in July 2024, on retail prices. Using price quotes for 48 popular firearms from over 2,200 licensed dealers, we compare California prices to those in other states and to pre-tax trends. We find that prices in California increase by about 10% in response to the 11% tax. Results are consistent across gun types and show no evidence of border spillovers. These findings indicate that firearm excise taxes can effectively raise consumer prices.</content>

    <title>Avoiding Prejudice: Islamophobia and the Labor Supply of Arabs and Muslims in the U.S.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides direct evidence that members of a disfavored group adjust their economic behavior in response to prejudice. We exploit plausibly exogenous, localized increases in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment generated by combat fatalities of U.S. service members from a given state during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. Linking detailed records on military fatalities with survey data, we estimate the causal effect of these shocks on the labor supply of Arab and Muslim men residing in the affected states. Following a home-state fatality, Arab and Muslim men reduce their weekly hours of work by approximately one percent relative to the baseline sample mean. The reduction is twice as large among the self-employed and concentrated in occupations requiring frequent customer or co-worker interaction. These patterns are consistent with avoidance-based sorting predicted by prejudice-based models of discrimination. The timing of the response coincides with short-lived increases in anti-Muslim hate crimes, confirming that the estimated effects reflect shifts in prejudice rather than broader economic conditions. Our findings provide direct evidence that prejudice can distort market outcomes by inducing targeted individuals to withdraw from interactions with prejudiced market participants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present the first large-scale field experiment test of strategic complementarities in firms’ technology adoption. Our experiment was embedded in a Bank of Italy survey covering around 3,000 firms. We elicited firms’ beliefs about competitors’ adoption of two advanced technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. We randomly provided half of the sample with accurate information about adoption rates. Most firms substantially underestimated competitors’ current adoption, and when provided with information, they updated their expectations about competitors’ future adoption. The information increased firms’ own intended future adoption of robotics, although we do not observe a significant effect on AI adoption. Our findings provide causal evidence on coordination in innovation and illustrate how information frictions shape technology diffusion.</content>

    <title>Patient Peer Effects: Evidence from Nursing Home Room Assignments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide causal evidence that patient peer effects generate mortality impacts comparable to provider quality differences. Drawing on administrative records covering 2.6 million stays (2000–2010) across 7,200 U.S. nursing homes, we exploit plausibly exogenous roommate assignments identified through unique room identifiers. We estimate that assignment to a roommate diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD), relative to placement in a private room, increases 90-day mortality by 2.1 percentage points (14% of baseline)—equivalent to receiving care at a nursing home one full standard deviation worse in quality. Effects differ sharply by patient type: patients with AD/ADRD benefit substantially from cognitively healthy roommates but not from private rooms, suggesting important peer monitoring and support roles. In contrast, mortality of patients without AD/ADRD does not depend on roommate cognitive health but is reduced in private rooms. A simple assignment rule exploiting this heterogeneity could reduce overall mortality by 0.8 percentage points without additional resources.</content>

    <title>Trials Avoid High Risk Patients and Underestimate Drug Harms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The FDA does not formally regulate representativeness, but if trials under-enroll vulnerable patients, the resulting evidence may understate harm from drugs. We study the relationship between trial participation and the risk of drug-induced adverse events for cancer medications using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program linked to Medicare claims. Initiating treatment with a cancer drug increases the risk of hospitalization due to serious adverse events (SAE) by 2 percentage points per month (a 250% increase). Heterogeneity in SAE treatment effects can be predicted by patient's comorbidities, frailty, and demographic characteristics. Patients at the 90th percentile of the risk distribution experience a 2.5 times greater increase in SAEs after treatment initiation compared to patients at the 10th percentile of the risk distribution yet are 4 times less likely to enroll in trials. The predicted SAE treatment effects for the drug's target population are 15% larger than the predicted SAE treatment effects for trial enrollees, corresponding to 1 additional induced SAE hospitalization for every 25 patients per year of treatment. We formalize conditions under which regulating representativeness of SAE risk will lead to more externally valid trials, and we discuss how our results could inform regulatory requirements.</content>
