    <title>An Evaluation of Biases in Wellbeing Estimates Using Interviewers Versus Online Data Collection in the Global Flourishing Study</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Survey mode is a critical consideration in well-being research using the 22 country Global Flourishing Study (GFS).  We find marked differences in responses to well-being questions if they are obtained via a telephone interviewer (CATI) or online (CAWI).  In fifteen countries in the GFS both survey modes are used.  In seven of the most advanced countries, only CAWI is used.  Well-being responses are markedly different across survey modes within countries using both modes and compared to countries only using CAWI.  On average, CATI tends to produce higher well-being scores.  Failure to account for these sampling differences biases results.  This is the case in twenty-three prior studies that used the GFS and took no account of survey mode.  We examine each of these studies and show the findings differ by survey mode.  Combined with the presence of other unobservable country-level confounders, the differences between survey modes substantively weakens the internal validity of cross-country comparisons and random effects meta-analysis conducted with the GFS.</content>

    <title>Volatile Rates, Fragile Growth: Global Financial Risk and Productivity Dynamics</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that rising volatility in U.S. interest rates, a key dimension of global financial risk, notably depresses the trend of economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs) but not in advanced economies (AEs). Using a panel state-space model, we show that a one standard- deviation shock to U.S. monetary policy uncertainty permanently lowers the level of GDP in EMEs by about 25 basis points after three years, with negligible effects in AEs. We rationalize this fact in a small open economy model where firms borrow against future profits to finance innovation. Higher volatility compresses firm values, tightens collateral constraints, and endogenously slows productivity growth, especially when financial frictions are severe.</content>

    <title>The Rise of Specialized Financial Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The variety of financial products available for firms to raise funds has expanded rapidly in recent decades. This paper studies the role of innovations that introduce specialized financial products using a combination of granular data and a parsimonious model of security issuance. We present three key findings. First, differential product adoption across firms explains most of the observed variation in the amounts of funds raised. Second, firms that adopt new products are more successful in raising funds. Third, the funds raised from new financial products are often sourced from numerous highly specialized products, each used by only a few firms.</content>

    <title>Patents to Products: Product Innovation and Firm Dynamics</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We match patents to products using natural language methods applied to detailed product descriptions and patent texts in the consumer goods sector. While more than half of product innovations originate from non-patenting firms, patent filings are on average followed by subsequent product introductions. Yet this relationship weakens with firm size. Patents held by market leaders also yield revenue premiums beyond what can be explained by their own product introductions and are associated with stronger deterrence of competitors’ innovations. To interpret these findings, we develop a simple growth model in which larger firms have stronger incentives to engage in strategic patenting—filing for protection rather than market innovation—which dampens innovation and slows creative destruction.</content>

    <title>Multidimensional Sorting: Comparative Statics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In sorting literature, comparative statics for multidimensional assignment models with general output functions and input distributions is an important open question. We provide a complete theory of comparative statics for technological change in general multidimensional assignment models. Our main result is that any technological change is uniquely decomposed into two distinct components. The first component (gradient) gives a characterization of changes in marginal earnings through a Poisson equation. The second component (divergence-free) gives a characterization of labor reallocation. For U.S. data, we quantify equilibrium responses in sorting and earnings with respect to cognitive skill-biased technological change.</content>

    <title>Identity and Ideology in the School Boardroom</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School boards have statutory authority over most elementary and secondary education policies, but receive little attention compared to other actors in education systems. A fundamental challenge to understanding the importance of boards is the absence of data on the policy goals of board members—i.e., their ideologies—forcing researchers to conduct tests based on demographic and professional characteristics—i.e., identities—with which ideology is presumed to correlate. This paper uses new data on the viewpoints and policy actions of school board members, coupled with a regression discontinuity design that generates quasi-random variation in board composition, to establish two results. The first is that the priorities of board members have large causal effects across many domains. For example, the effect of electing an equity-focused board member on test scores for low-income students is roughly equivalent to assigning every such student a teacher who is 0.3 to 0.4 SDs higher in the distribution of teacher value-added. The second is that observing policy priorities is crucial. Identity turns out to be a poor proxy for ideology, with limited governance effects that are fully explained by differences in policy priorities. Our findings challenge the belief that school boards are unimportant, showing that who serves on the board and what they prioritize can have far-reaching consequences for students.</content>

    <title>How Good is International Risk Sharing? Stepping Outside the Shadow of the Welfare Theorems</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit whether global output is (Pareto) efficiently distributed across countries over time. The efficient allocation of goods across regions requires that the relative marginal utilities of consumption across countries comoves with the relative costs of the country-specific consumption bundles.  Standard approaches to evaluating this property exploit the Welfare Theorems and equate the observed real exchange rate with the social relative costs of consumption.  Given the large literature documenting the disconnect between exchange rates, relative prices faced by consumers in a given market, and relative quantities consumed, we develop a methodology that measures relative costs that is robust to this disconnect.  We find that relative consumption growth across regions is significantly more correlated with our computed shadow prices than it is with observed real exchange rates, suggesting an allocation closer to efficient risk sharing.  Moreover, we provide a decentralization that matches observed prices and quantities, enabling us to rationalize the better implied risk sharing with the failure of the standard correlations.  The decentralization involves a combination of segmented foreign exchange markets and pricing-to-market behavior in goods markets.  The model implies that consumption allocations are insulated from excess fluctuations in the exchange rate via the equilibrium pricing behavior of exporters.</content>

    <title>The Cost of State-Building: Evidence from Germany</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the potential of pro-development state (capacity) building projects to be coopted for repression. I leverage the natural experiment created by the differential build-up of capacity between formerly Prussian and formerly non-Prussian parts of unified Germany, and the radical policy shifts instigated by the Nazi regime. Across a geographical discontinuity, and across different stops of the same train transport to the East, I find that Prussian municipalities were significantly more efficient at deporting Germany's Jews. They were also better at providing public goods and at collecting taxes. Just before the Nazis came to power, Prussian municipalities also provided public goods more efficiently, but were not differentially involved with anti-Semitism. I show that democratic oversight and aspects of bureaucratic culture can mitigate the potential for future abuse of state building projects.</content>

    <title>Elections and Political Investment</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Elections select officeholders and policies, but they also signal to political actors where to invest their time and money. This paper presents a framework for understanding these effects, in which political investors (e.g., donors, activists) allocate resources where expected political fundamentals favor their party. Investors possess idiosyncratic local knowledge but also public information in the form of recent election results. These signals are complementary: where local knowledge is good, even the narrowest vote-share majorities can align beliefs and concentrate investment. I apply this framework to the changing political geography of the United States between 1940 and 1972, when urban and minority areas came into play for the Democratic Party. A regression discontinuity design based on close presidential elections shows that counties narrowly won by Democrats saw pronounced increases in Democratic local officeholding and voter support in subsequent election periods. This does not reflect direct impacts of presidential elections on local offices, but rather indirect shifts through political investment, including heightened activity in newspaper advertising, phone banking, and civil rights mobilization. Effects are concentrated in urban, Black, and union areas where dense organizational networks enhanced local political knowledge. Together, the findings show how elections organize political actors not only at the ballot box but through the information they convey.</content>

    <title>Learning and the Emergence of Nonlinearity in Financial Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial markets (and more generally the real economy) display a wide range of important nonlinearities. This paper focuses on stock returns, which are skewed
left – generating crashes – and whose volatility moves over time, is itself skewed, is strongly related to the level of prices, and displays long memory. This paper shows that such behavior is almost inevitable when prices are formed by investors acquiring information about the true, but latent, value of stocks. It studies a general model of filtering in which agents receive signals about the fundamental value of the stock market and dynamically update their beliefs (potentially with biases). When those beliefs are non-normal and investors believe crashes can happen, prices generically display the range of nonlinearities observed in the data. While the model does not explain where crashes come from, it shows that investors believing that prices can crash is sufficient to generate the rich higher-order dynamics observed empirically. In a simple calibration with iid shocks to fundamentals, the model fits well quantitatively, and regression-based tests support the model’s mechanism.</content>

    <title>What Would it Cost to End Extreme Poverty?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study poverty minimization via direct transfers, framing this as a statistical learning problem while retaining the information constraints faced by real-world programs. Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world’s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income. Extrapolated globally, the results correspond to a cost of (approximately) ending extreme poverty of roughly 0.3% of global GDP.</content>

    <title>From RANK to HANK, without FIRE</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We offer guidance and tools for augmenting macroeconomic models with a realistic friction in expectations and for quantifying its implications. We start by distilling the common essence of a few popular alternatives to FIRE (Full Information Rational Expectations), including noisy or sticky information, rational or behavioral inattention, level-k thinking and cognitive discounting. We then develop a new specification, which captures the same essence while maximizing tractability. We show how this works in both RANK (the Representative-Agent New Keynesian model) and HANK (Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models). We further clarify the separate partial- and general-equilibrium effects of informational frictions or bounded rationality; emphasize the interaction of such frictions with the Intertemporal Keynesian Cross and other forms of strategic complementarity; review concrete lessons for business cycles and macroeconomic policy; and discuss how to discipline the theory with appropriate survey evidence.</content>

    <title>Generous Long-Term Contracts</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sylvain Chassang</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that in long-term consumer–producer relationships, menus of contracts can often be advantageously replaced by a single generous contract such that, at any point in time, a consumer’s cumulative transfers equal the cumulative transfers they would have made under the contract that would have been best for them in hindsight. Such generous long-term contracts can increase skeptical consumers’ demand for complex and higher-powered contracts while approximately implementing the same outcomes as the underlying menu evaluated by a rational decision maker. Applications include voluntary load shedding in retail electricity markets and cost sharing in health insurance.</content>

    <title>Rebuilding Ukraine's Cities: Maximizing Benefits and Minimizing Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper discusses the rebuilding of Ukrainian cities. We start by outlining key facts about Ukraine and its cities: (i) the country’s population is declining; (ii) there is a shift in demand for housing from east to west; (iii) Kyiv’s advantage is growing; (iv) house prices are rising in Kyiv and western cities, (v) Ukraine’s cities are slow and congested. We then present a theoretical framework for maximizing the benefits of Ukraine’s rebuilding effort to highlight the welfare effects of different allocations of post-war infrastructure. Finally, we consider the cost curve for reconstruction, as determined, in particular, by the cost of materials, labor, the industrial organization of the building industry and public practices in procurement and regulation. We highlight three broad strategies for shifting the cost curve: openness, standardization and investing-in-investing. We conclude by outlining areas for future research.</content>

    <title>Agglomeration, Segregation and Imperial Origins</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What explains the dramatic differences in earnings across locations? We employ an administrative employer-employee linked dataset from Italy that includes the country’s entire workforce to estimate firm-worker or location-worker effects. We also estimate differences in human capital accumulation across firms and cities. We find that the elasticity of the location premia to density is smaller than in other settings and that other locational characteristics, such as segregation in school or the workplace and inter-generational mobility, are more strongly correlated with earnings and earnings growth. Our place-based estimates are similar if we focus on movers who were forced to relocate after the L’Aquila Earthquake. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that density levels jump up at the historic border between House of Savoy-ruled Piedmont and the Hapsburg Empire. Earnings today also jump at the border. This finding suggests that there may be some unintended effects of being a far-flung province of a distant empire, perhaps because of access to larger markets or the administrative and educational reforms that began under Empress Maria Theresa.</content>

    <title>Who Chooses and Who Benefits? The Design of Public School Choice Systems</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Christopher Campos, Jesse Bruhn, Eric Chyn &amp; Antonia Vazquez</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public school choice has evolved rapidly in the past two decades, as districts roll out new magnet, dual-language, and themed programs to broaden educational opportunity. We use newly collected national data to document that opt-in (voluntary) systems: (i) are the modal design; (ii) are harder to navigate; and (iii) have participation that is concentrated among more advantaged students. These facts suggest a striking inconsistency: districts have largely adopted centralized assignment algorithms to broaden access, but most rely on optional participation that fragments public education. We study the implications of this design choice in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest opt-in system in the country, combining nearly two decades of administrative data, randomized lotteries, and quasi-experimental expansions in access. Participation is highly selective, consistent with national evidence, and lottery estimates suggest that the students with the lowest demand for choice schools are the ones who gain the most from attending. Opt-in participation therefore embeds a selection mechanism that screens out high-return students and leaves many effective programs with unused capacity. To evaluate system-level implications, we estimate a structural model linking applications, enrollment, and achievement. Choice schools are vertically differentiated and generate meaningful gains, but the opt-in participation rule—through high application costs and negative selection on gains—prevents these benefits from reaching the students who need them most. Counterfactual simulations make the design stakes clear: information and travel-cost reductions have limited effects, whereas reforms that change the participation architecture eliminate core inefficiencies and deliver the largest district-wide achievement gains. These results underscore that system design— not school effectiveness alone—shapes who benefits from public school choice and to what extent.</content>

    <title>Worker Preparedness Across the Marshallian Runs Survey Instruments and Early Evidence from the Copenhagen Life Panel</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Andrew Caplin, Søren Leth-Petersen, Victoria Gregory, Ida Maria Hartmann, Eungik Lee &amp; Johan Sæverud</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Worker preparedness is a missing transmission channel in macroeconomics. Alfred Marshall’s taxonomy of short-, medium-, and long-run adjustment was developed to analyse how firms respond to shocks when different inputs can or cannot adjust. We extend this logic to workers by adding an element Marshall’s framework leaves implicit: anticipation. Preparedness refers to the buffers, search strategies, fallback plans, and retraining intentions individuals form before disruption occurs. These forward-looking margins shape both microeconomic outcomes and the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy.
The registry-linked Copenhagen Life Panel (CLP) provides a data architecture for making preparedness observable. By embedding belief and strategy elicitation within administrative records, the CLP makes it possible to test whether workers’ expectations and contingency plans are calibrated to the risks they face. Early evidence shows that short-run preparedness—liquidity, earnings-risk beliefs, and separation expectations—is measurable and predictive, and that miscalibration is a key source of vulnerability.
The broader agenda is to measure preparedness across Marshallian runs and across the worker life cycle. In the medium run, adjustment depends on search strategies and fallback planning; in the long run, retraining and occupational reorientation determine whether technological disruption becomes renewal or decline. We outline survey instruments for each run that can be integrated with registry data, transforming preparedness from conjecture into measurable and model-ready constructs.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Spousal Social Security Claiming Decisions on the Financial Shock of Widowhood</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Sita Slavov</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents evidence suggesting that delayed Social Security claiming by husbands – resulting in an actuarially enhanced benefit – attenuates the financial shock of widowhood for their wives. Under Social Security survivor benefit rules, primary earners (usually husbands) pass on the actuarial adjustments from delayed claiming to their surviving spouses. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, I find women whose husbands delayed claiming to full retirement age or later face a post-widowhood increase of 6.9 percentage points in the probability of falling below the 5th percentile of the pre-widowhood income distribution. This effect is almost 12 percent smaller for each year of delayed claiming by the husband (though the attenuation is concentrated in the first 4 years of widowhood). The general findings are robust to instrumenting for the husband’s claiming age using the loosening of the retirement earnings test in 2000 – a policy change that incentivized earlier claiming.</content>

    <title>New Keynesian Economics with Household and Firm Heterogeneity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian literature has revisited the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy to consumption using models where heterogeneous households face idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints. We show that the key lessons from this literature also apply to investment using a model where heterogeneous firms face idiosyncratic productivity risk and financial frictions: constrained firms’ investment depends on their free cash flow, generating indirect effects of monetary policy and implying that transfer payments stimulate investment demand. Quantitatively, the strength of these new mechanisms is governed by firms’ marginal propensities to invest (MPIs), similar to the role of marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) for households. But unlike MPCs, we currently lack quasi-experimental evidence about MPIs that we can use to directly discipline the new mechanisms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document six facts about the structure and dynamics of the LLM market using API usage data from OpenRouter and Microsoft Azure. First, we show rapid growth in the number of models, creators, and inference providers, driven by open-source entrants. Second, we show price declines and persistent price heterogeneity across and within intelligence tiers, with open-source models being 90% cheaper than comparable closed-source models of the same intelligence. Third, we document market dynamism, with frequent turnover among leading models and creators. Fourth, we present evidence of horizontal and vertical differentiation, with no single model dominating across use cases, and demand for intelligence varying widely across applications. Fifth, we estimate preliminary short-run price elasticities just above one, suggesting limited scope for Jevons-Paradox effects. Finally, we show that although the share of firms that use multiple models increased over time, most firms concentrate their use on a single model, consistent with experimentation rather than persistent reliance on multiple models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the introduction of the first antibiotic therapies in 1937 to examine the long-run effects of early-childhood pneumonia on adult educational attainment, employment, income, and work-related disability. Using census data, we document large average improvements across all outcomes, alongside substantial heterogeneity by gender and race. Among women, health gains led to changes in marriage and fertility that partially offset their labor market improvements. Among Black Americans, we uncover a pronounced gradient linked to systemic racial discrimination in the pre–Civil Rights era: individuals born in more discriminatory Jim Crow states realized much smaller gains than those born in less discriminatory states, despite larger reductions in pneumonia exposure. There is no similar gradient among white Americans. Together, these findings highlight the central role of institutional environments in shaping whether investments in early-life health translate into long-run socioeconomic gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine women's household power in low- and middle-income countries, synthesizing theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence on its measurement, determinants, and consequences. We define women's household power as their influence over household choices, distinguishing it from broader empowerment concepts. We review economic models, including unitary, collective, and bargaining frameworks, and map these to empirical approaches. We then discuss measurement methods  such as structural estimation of consumption allocation, survey measures, and laboratory experiments. On the determinants of women's power, we find that some approaches, such as transfers targeted to women, show mixed results, while others, such as increasing women's control over their earnings, show clearer positive impacts. On the effects of women's power, we pay special attention to children's human capital. Few studies provide strong evidence that mothers invest more in children than fathers do, but collectively the evidence suggests such an effect. We conclude by highlighting research and methodological gaps.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure benefits to households from Mumbai’s new Metro rail system. We estimate a commute mode choice model to value commute time savings in the short run and a housing choice model to value the improved commuting utility that households experience due to spatial sorting. Aggregate benefits from Metro rail are over 10 times higher when spatial sorting occurs. In the short run women, college-educated workers, and workers with above median incomes experience higher benefits than their opposites. In the long run, households with lower incomes and assets and less than college education benefit more than their wealthier counterparts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how production networks shape the severity of Sudden Stops. We build a small open economy model with collateral constraints and input–output linkages, derive a sufficient statistic that maps network structure into the amplification of tradable shocks, and show that a planner optimally introduces sectoral wedges to reduce amplification. Using OECD input–output data and Sudden Stop episodes, we document systematic network differences between emerging and advanced economies and show they predict crisis severity. A calibrated three-sector DSGE model disciplined by these differences reveals that endowing an advanced economy with an emerging-market production network moves most of the way toward the observed emerging–advanced Sudden Stop gap.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study examines the quasi-natural experiments provided by the staggered introduction of open drivers in the supply chains for routers. It is rare to observe components become open and measure whether openness generates a statistical impact on more products and innovative products. This study collects novel data on all routers and subcomponents introduced between 2000 and 2018, characterizing each firm's position in a supply chain as either an upstream component provider or a downstream router assembler. Following prior literature, openness influences a firm's ability to negotiate with current and potential partners, which is labeled as autonomy. Evidence suggests that openness enhances supplier autonomy, increases the introduction of new products, and leads to a greater number of products located closer to the technical frontier. These estimates suggest that openness increased product introductions by enlarging the options available to component suppliers. The largest component suppliers benefited from greater sales, and no evidence indicates that openness aided entrants, small firms, or assemblers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital is central to efforts to promote growth, convergence, and the elimination of poverty. Drawing on the seminal macroeconomic frameworks by Nelson-Phelps, Lucas and subsequent developments, alongside macro and microeconomic evidence, we examine the role of human capital in driving innovation and growth. We highlight how different types of human capital, characterized by education level, matter in different stages of development. Despite documented increases in years of schooling, the world’s poorest regions still see stagnating outcomes in learning and education quality, potentially creating poverty traps where investments in neither physical nor human capital materialize. We discuss obstacles to human capital accumulation through a simple analytical framework and present evidence from randomized interventions spanning early childhood programs to school-age initiatives, assessing policies that can effectively remove barriers to skill acquisition and establish foundations for sustained growth.</content>

    <title>Fiscal Inaction as Monetary Support</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the fiscal framework affect the central bank's ability to stabilize output and inflation? The textbook answer, which assumes Ricardian households, recommends that fiscal adjustment should be fast enough to allow for monetary dominance. We instead argue that, with non-Ricardian households, the central bank may indeed welcome slow, or even no, fiscal adjustment. On the demand side, slow fiscal adjustment helps stabilize aggregate spending; on the supply side, it eases tax distortions, improving the output-inflation trade off. And while the first channel favors slow fiscal adjustment only when the business cycle is dominated by demand shocks, the second channel extends this preference to supply shocks. A quantitative exercise affirms our lessons in the U.S. context, with the central bank preferring virtually no fiscal adjustment over the business cycle.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how digital incentives influence survey participation and engagement in a large randomized controlled trial of parents across seven Texas school districts. We test how incentive amount and information about vendor options affect response behavior and explore differences by language background. Incentivized parents were more likely to start and complete surveys and claim gift cards, though Spanish-speaking parents exhibited distinct patterns—greater completion rates but lower redemption rates, often selecting essential-goods vendors. Increasing incentive value and providing advance information both improved engagement. Findings inform the design of equitable, effective digital incentive strategies for diverse populations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial behavior plays a role in many economic contexts, and it has been explained by altruism, social pressure, signaling, and expectations of fairness and reciprocity. We examine prosocial behavior in a context that allows us to distinguish the role of self-signaling and social signaling from alternative explanations, including warm glow. Our context is residential solar, and  self-signaling is separately identified from social signaling by the exogenous visibility of potential solar arrays. We show that the political affiliation of proximate peers influences the extent of self-signaling and is crowded out by the private benefits of installing solar.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test for and measure green waste: the misallocation of public subsidies for green investment projects. Our context is a major Norwegian program for green investment subsidies. We develop a model of subsidy allocation and apply it to detailed project-level data on carbon emissions and subsidy amounts for both marginal and inframarginal projects. We find that decision-makers could have achieved the same level of emission reductions at less than half the cost. To isolate the sources of this green waste, we use data on both ex-ante expected and ex-post realized emission reductions for each project. We find that decision-makers are able ex-ante to identify the projects with the highest ex-post emission reductions but unwilling to select them.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well known that standard frequentist inference breaks down in IV regressions with weak instruments. Bayesian inference with diffuse priors suffers from the same problem. We show that the issue arises because flat priors on the first-stage coefficients overstate instrument strength. In contrast, inference improves drastically when an uninformative prior is specified directly on the concentration parameter—the key nuisance parameter capturing instrument relevance. The resulting Bayesian credible intervals are asymptotically equivalent to the frequentist confidence intervals based on conditioning approaches, and remain robust to weak instruments.</content>

    <title>The Morality of Market Exchanges: Between Societal Values and Tradeoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Certain behaviors in markets are unambiguously unethical. In other cases, however, voluntary exchanges that can create gains from trade remain contested on moral grounds, because of what is traded or of the price at which the exchange occurs. This chapter offers a framework to analyze these contested markets and provides examples of two general instances. First, we examine “repugnant” transactions involving the human body—such as compensated organ donation and gestational surrogacy—where concerns about dignity, exploitation, and inequality conflict with welfare gains from expanding supply. Second, we study price gouging in emergencies, where demands for a “just price” clash with the incentive and allocation roles of price adjustments under scarcity. Across both cases, we synthesize evidence on societal attitudes and highlight how support for policy options depends on perceived trade-offs between autonomy, fairness and efficiency, and on institutional features that can separate compensation from allocation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hedge funds have become increasingly active in Treasury markets, yet we have little  evidence on how this shift has affected the market. We focus on the primary market, where the government issues its debt through auctions. Using over 20 years of  data from Canadian Treasury auctions, we document dealers exiting and hedge funds entering. To evaluate the costs and benefits of this trend for debt issuance, we develop an auction framework with endogenous participation. We find that the expected gains from greater hedge fund participation, driven by increased competition, are smaller than the costs that arise because hedge funds—unlike dealers—do not participate regularly. Currently, dealer participation remains sufficiently strong that policies aimed at stabilizing  participation have little effect on funding costs.</content>

    <title>Ruling for the Rich: the Supreme Court over Time</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To investigate the emergence of a pro-wealthy bias in the US Supreme Court, we develop a protocol to identify and analyze all cases involving economic issues from 1953 to the present. We categorize the parties in these cases as “rich” or “poor” according to their likelihood of being wealthy. A vote is pro-rich if that outcome would directly shift resources to the party that is more likely to be wealthy. Using this dataset, we estimate case-specific intercepts, justice-specific latent ideal points, and party-level time trends using the Bayesian methods pioneered by Martin and Quinn (2002). In the 1950s, justices appointed by the two parties appear similar in their propensity to cast pro-rich votes. Over the sample period, we estimate a steady increase in polarization, culminating in an implied party gap of 47 percentage points by 2022. The magnitude of the gap suggests the usefulness of an economic metric for prediction relative to ideologies such as originalism or textualism.</content>

    <title>From Treatment to Safety: The Role of Substance Use Treatment in Preventing Intimate Partner Violence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substance use is a well-established driver of intimate partner violence (IPV), with drug-related incidents posing persistent challenges for both public health and criminal justice systems. We examine how expanding access to substance use treatment (SUT) services affects IPV in the United States by leveraging variation in the opening and closing of treatment facilities at the county level. Using administrative data on IPV incidents from the National Incident-Based Reporting System at the agency level from 1998 to 2019 combined with county-level records on treatment facility information, we implement a continuous difference-in-differences research design. Our results show that adding three SUT facilities—the average annual increase per county over the sample period—reduces drug-involved IPV by about 1.5–1.7 percent. We find no evidence of significant effects on alcohol-related or non-substance-related IPV. Staggered event-study analyses confirm parallel outcome trends, across treated and non-treated counties, prior to net facility openings and lend support to a causal interpretation of the estimates. Related evidence from SUT admissions drawn from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) shows that new centers significantly raise treatment entry, particularly among men, consistent with reduced perpetration driving the observed decline in IPV exposure. Our findings highlight the role of health services infrastructure in shaping violence-related outcomes and underscore the broader public safety benefits of investment in treatment access.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a formal fixed-income framework to value sticky deposits. This framework provides closed-form expressions for deposit values and allows us to study the impact of stickiness on deposit interest-rate and runoff risks. The duration of a bank deposit can be either positive or negative, which has important implications for hedging the interest-rate risk of bank balance sheets. Banks that maximize deposit value by following optimal deposit beta strategies may significantly increase their interest-rate and deposit runoff risks. We test the empirical implications of the valuation model using market deposit premia observed in bank merger/acquisition transactions. The results provide strong empirical support for the model’s predictions.</content>

    <title>Tariff War Shock and the Convenience Yield of US Treasuries — A Hedging Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explain how the “Tariff War” shock of April 2025 affected the safe-asset status of US Treasuries. Convenience yield erosion for long bonds is consistent with a reduction in the hedging property, reflected in a rising stock-bond covariance. Decomposing the Treasury yield into risk-free rate, credit spread, and convenience yield components reveals that covariance due to the convenience yield component increased for long bonds. The short end of the Treasury curve, however, continued to exhibit the safe-asset hedging property. These effects are consistent with a withdrawal of safe-asset investors from long-term Treasuries and a rotation towards shorter-term Treasuries and gold.</content>

    <title>O-Ring Automation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study automation when tasks are quality complements rather than separable. Production requires numerous tasks whose qualities multiply as in an O-ring technology. A worker allocates a fixed endowment of time across the tasks performed; machines can replace tasks with given quality, and time is allocated across the remaining manual tasks. This “focus” mechanism generates three results. First, task-by-task substitution logic is incomplete because automating one task changes the return to automating others. Second, automation decisions are discrete and can require bundled adoption even when automation quality improves smoothly. Third, labour income can rise under partial automation because automation scales the value of remaining bottleneck tasks. These results imply that widely-used exposure indices, which aggregate task-level automation risk using linear formulas, will overstate displacement when tasks are complements. The relevant object is not average task exposure but the structure of bottlenecks and how automation reshapes worker time around them.</content>

    <title>Biases in Belief Updating Within and Across Domains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do people sometimes overreact to new information and other times underreact? We develop a model in which the strength of a signal—how much one should update their beliefs with new information—depends on multiple features of the information environment. Limited attention to these features leads to misperceptions of signal strength: people approach a problem with an experience-based prior, which they adjust only partially based on how much attention they pay to different features. This mechanism explains a wide range of belief-updating patterns. Insensitivity to a single feature generates underreaction to strong and overreaction to weak signals, and more neglected features amplify this. Insensitivity to multiple features can instead break that pattern: insensitivity to one feature can generate excess sensitivity with respect to another, leading to overreaction to both weak and strong signals. A series of experiments provides support for the model and its underlying mechanism.</content>

    <title>Making Entrepreneurs: Long Term Returns to Training Youth in Business Skills</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the medium and long term impacts of Skills for Effective Entrepreneurship Development (SEED), a 3-week entrepreneurship training program for secondary school students in Uganda. The mini-MBA, modeled after business school curricula, was implemented as a randomized field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 4,402 youth. After four years, the training improved both hard and soft skills. SEED graduates became more effective negotiators and communicators and exhibited improved self-efficacy, stability, plasticity, and stress management. In the medium run, treated youth were more likely to start enterprises and more successful in ensuring their survival, thereby gaining greater entrepreneurial experience. Their ventures were also of higher quality: more likely to be formal, have employees, be in collaboration with other entrepreneurs, and use effective business management practices. With 52% of the sample still enrolled in post-secondary education, we find suggestive evidence that businesses led by the treatment groups performed better. After nine years, business ownership converged between treatment and control groups as control ownership rates doubled. However, SEED graduates maintained their edge in terms of business quality and operated firms with 20% higher revenues and 16% higher profits, without corresponding increases in capital or labor inputs, consistent with higher total factor productivity. Entrepreneurial success was achieved through the adoption of better business practices and experimentation, with soft skills related to entrepreneurial mindset playing a complementary role. SEED generated high returns on investment: the present discounted values of SEED-induced business and total earnings equal 20 and 27 times program costs, respectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study dynamic visual representations as a proxy for investor sentiment about the stock market. Our sentiment index, GIFsentiment, is constructed from millions of posts in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) on a leading investment social media platform. GIFsentiment correlates with seasonal mood variations and the severity of COVID lockdowns. It is positively associated with contemporaneous market returns and negatively predicts returns for up to four weeks, even after controlling for other sentiment and attention measures. These effects are stronger among portfolios that are more susceptible to mispricing. GIFsentiment positively predicts trading volume, market volatility, and flows toward equity funds and away from debt funds. Our evidence suggests that GIFsentiment is a proxy for misperceptions that are later corrected.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how traders' equity capitalization influences asset prices in a framework that accounts for market power. In our model, traders with capital constraints engage in transactions in an imperfectly competitive market. We demonstrate that looser capital constraints elevate both asset prices and price impact, the latter diminishing market liquidity. Using Canadian Treasury auction data, we illustrate how to apply our model to quantify these effects. We estimate the shadow costs of capital constraints by leveraging a temporary policy exemption during 2020-2021. We show that while these constraints are only infrequently binding, their relative impact when activated can be sizable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use population-wide administrative data from Denmark and an event-study design spanning nearly two decades to examine the impact of having a parent with dementia on adult children’s labor market, physical health, and mental health outcomes. We find no meaningful effects on labor supply, earnings, or physical health care use. In contrast, mental health care use increases substantially, driven by daughters, beginning five years before a parent’s dementia-related death, peaking around the time of death, and converging to the counterfactual trend over seven years. Results suggest that robust long-term care policy can largely insulate adult children economically from parental dementia, but mental health spillovers persist, spurring nearly a decade of elevated use.</content>

    <title>The Incredible Shrinking Instruments: Using Empirical Bayes to Increase Efficiency in IV Designs with Many Instruments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In instrumental variables (IV) estimation with many instruments, such as judge fixed effects designs, the precision of the jackknife-estimated first stage can vary widely across observations.  When such variability exists, we show that the precision of JIVE second-stage estimates is meaningfully improved by shrinking judge propensities towards their conditional means, where the shrinkage factor depends on the precision of the first-stage fitted value.  Doing so requires no further assumptions and identifies the same local average treatment effect as the usual (unshrunken) JIVE estimator. We illustrate the precision gains from using a Shrunken JIVE estimator (SJIVE) in an application from the literature studying pre-trial detention of defendants in criminal cases.</content>

    <title>Unwilling to Reskill? Experimental Evidence from Real-World Jobseekers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study barriers preventing jobseekers from pursuing reskilling in high-demand occupations. Using a discrete choice experiment, we quantify the demand for reskilling among Italian jobseekers in two white-collar high-demand occupations—information technology assistant and construction technician—and identify its main determinants. Willingness to pay estimates show that participants are willing to pay to reskill into IT, but would require compensation to reskill into construction. Beliefs about monetary returns and social status help explain differences in reskilling demand, but perceived identity fit in the target occupation emerges as the most important individual-level factor shaping reskilling decisions. A light-touch randomized information intervention providing data on occupational returns significantly increases both stated interest in reskilling and actual engagement in real-world training.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The global expansion of renewable energy is key to addressing climate change. After a decade of dramatic cost reductions—especially for solar photovoltaics and wind—renewables now approach cost parity with fossil generation. While this cost reduction has led to a steep increase in solar and wind power in several countries, the global share of solar and wind generation remains modest—approximately 15% as of 2023. This article reviews recent economic studies and identifies three central challenges and corresponding opportunities for scaling up renewable energy—underdeveloped regulatory and market design, insufficient intertemporal market integration, and inadequate spatial market integration. The insights from this review highlight effective ways to accelerate the global transition to renewable energy.</content>

    <title>How Monetary Policy Is Made: Lessons from Historical FOMC Discussions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a new dataset of FOMC meeting transcripts from 1966 to 1990 to analyze the sources of heterogeneity in individual monetary policy preferences and study how this heterogeneity shapes policy decisions. Using these detailed discussions, we manually quantify and characterize each FOMC participants’ preferred policies along with their reasoning and justification. We show that participants' beliefs about the effects of monetary policy—specifically, their perceived slope of the Phillips Curve—play a central role. Participants who believe monetary policy has stronger effects on real activity are more likely to cite output as a justification for easing, while those perceiving stronger price effects emphasize inflation as a reason for tightening. We then show that the Chair plays a unique and powerful role in reconciling these views, not just in setting policy rates, but also in minimizing dissent. The latter occurs because dissenters find their ability to influence policy in subsequent meetings is significantly curtailed.</content>

    <title>The Labor Market Return to Permanent Residency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many temporary foreign worker programs issue “closed” visas that effectively tie workers to a single employer, restricting worker mobility and weakening bargaining power. We study the labor market return to temporary foreign workers (TFWs) gaining permanent residency (PR), which loosens this mobility restriction. Using administrative data linking matched employer-employee data in Canada to temporary and permanent visa records from 2004–2014 along with an event-study design, we find that gaining PR leads to a sharp, immediate, and persistent increase in the job switching rate of 21.7 percentage points and an increase in earnings of 5.7 percent three years after PR. Workers also sort into high-wage firms after gaining PR, and the increase in the firm pay premium is roughly 56 percent of the total earnings gain. We find larger earnings gains for job switchers across industries, low-skilled workers, and workers from low-income countries. To guide and interpret our reduced-form results, we develop a search-and-matching model featuring heterogeneous workers and firms. Permanent residents and native-born workers search for jobs in the same labor market and engage in on-the-job search, while TFWs search separately within a segmented labor market and do not receive outside wage offers. We calibrate the model to match our reduced-form results, and we use it to simulate the long-run effects of PR and consider two counterfactual policies: (1) increasing the cost to firms of posting a TFW vacancy and (2) allowing TFWs to switch employers freely under “open” visas. We evaluate how these policies affect output, wages, profits, and overall social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct an international panel data set comprising three distinct yet plausible measures of government indebtedness: the debt-to-GDP, the interest-to-GDP, and the debt-to-equity ratios. Our analysis reveals that these measures yield differing conclusions about recent trends in government indebtedness. While the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached historically high levels, the other two indicators show either no clear trend or a declining pattern over recent decades. We argue for the development of stronger theoretical foundations for the measures employed in the literature, suggesting that, without such grounding, assertions about debt (un)sustainability may be premature.</content>

    <title>A Unified Theory of Delegated Capital Management</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified theory of delegated capital management by extending the paradigm of Berk and Green (2004)  from mutual funds to alternative assets. With competitive markets and rational investors, we derive the optimal contract and account for observed regularities --- performance fees, persistent alpha, and limits on capital. The key distinction between mutual funds and alternatives is the liquidity of the underlying assets. When assets are illiquid, it is optimal to acquire information about the manager's skill. A positive alpha is therefore necessary to compensate informed investors and a performance based contract is required to induce these investors to allocate their capital optimally. At the same time, a free-rider problem emerges that requires capital constraints on uninformed investors. Thus, liquidity of the underlying assets explains the contrasting contract structures across sectors.</content>

    <title>Global Ripple Effects of Corporate Tax Reforms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel indicator for the People's Bank of China monetary policy stance, we estimate a policy rule that accounts for the dual nature of its price stability mandate—encompassing domestic inflation and the exchange rate—and for the evolution of its operational framework.  The “Ins”: The domestic transmission follows textbook patterns, with exceptions due to the active management of the renminbi and the financial account. The "Outs": International spillovers are powerful and affect commodity markets, global production and trade. The pass-through to foreign (US) prices is substantial. Financial spillovers are second-order, and mostly derivative from trade spillovers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces an endogenous network of payment chains into a business cycle model. Motivated by evidence of linked payments across firms in Costa Rica, we develop a framework where production orders form bilateral relations: some payments are executed immediately, while others---chained payments---are delayed until upstream payments are received. These chains capture real-world situations in which firms must wait to be paid before paying their own suppliers, leaving resources temporarily idle even when demand and capacity exist. In equilibrium, agents choose the amount of chained payments given interest rates and access to internal funds or credit lines. This choice determines the payment-chain network and aggregate total-factor productivity (TFP). The paper characterizes equilibrium dynamics and pecuniary externalities when agents internalize their own payment delays but not the delays imposed on others.</content>

    <title>Employment Impacts of the CHIPS Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The CHIPS and Science Act, enacted in August 2022, is a key element of the revival of U.S. industrial policy. We examine the short-term employment effects of the act. Drawing on quarterly industry-by-county data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), we implement two county-level difference-in-difference designs, the first comparing counties with pre-existing semiconductor facilities to other counties with high-tech industries and the second comparing counties with semiconductor fabrication facilities (which were targeted for the bulk of the CHIPS funding) to counties with non-fabrication semiconductor facilities. Using both approaches, we find robust, positive employment impacts in affected counties. The effects began at the time of the passage in the Senate of a precursor bill, in anticipation of the signing of the CHIPS Act. Our preferred estimates suggest an increase of 110 jobs per affected county in the first design and 180 jobs per affected county in the second design. We also find robust positive impacts on local construction employment. Evidence on total employment and GDP at the county level, as well as on employment in upstream input sectors, is mixed. Simple back-of-the-envelope calculations (which come with caveats) suggest national direct employment effects of approximately 15,000-16,000 jobs in the core semiconductor sector and indirect effects of 28,000-35,000 jobs in related sectors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on mutual fund flows and investment sustainability. The SFDR classifies funds into three categories to promote transparency and curb greenwashing: those with a sustainable investment objective (Article 9 or “dark green”), those that promote environmental characteristics (Article 8 or “light green”), and others (Article 6). Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the SFDR had little effect on fund flows or portfolio sustainability. The disclosures were ineffective in part because they offered little new or clear information beyond what investors could already infer from fund names and mandates. In an experimental setting, we show that the current disclosures have minimal impact on investor decisions, but making the information more intuitive could improve the regulation’s effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We take a new perspective on identification in structural dynamic models: rather than imposing restrictions, we optimize an objective. This provides new theoretical insights into traditional Cholesky identification. A correlation-maximizing objective yields an Order- and Scale-Invariant Identification Scheme (OASIS) that selects the orthogonal rotation that best aligns structural shocks with their reduced-form innovations. We revisit a large number of SVAR studies and find, across 22 published SVARs, that the correlations between structural and reduced-form shocks are generally high.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the determinants of corporate cash holdings by extending the standard q theory of investment with financing frictions and productivity shocks. While existing models predict a low propensity to hold cash, we show that realistic cash holdings arise only when three ingredients are combined: 1.) costly external financing, 2.) persistent productivity shocks, and 3.) contemporaneous productivity shocks. With costly external financing, persistent productivity shocks generate predictable cash flows and investment opportunities, but yield little need for savings since the internally generated cash flows are aligned with the investment needs. Contemporaneous shocks make internally generated cash flows random, inducing firms to hold cash at levels consistent with those observed empirically.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We review new developments in formal theory as applied to racial stratification. Across this literature, we discuss how discrimination produces benefits for advantaged groups at a cost to marginalized groups, how groups resolve conflicts between individual and collective interests, how direct discrimination is transformed into persistent inequality, and the implications of these forces for racial disparities, efficiency, and social welfare. For researchers active in Stratification Economics, we highlight parallels between intuitions about dimensions of racial discrimination and inequality developed by SE and insights from formal models by theorists outside SE. For formal theorists interested in working on questions of race and inequality, we provide an overview of how SE conceptualizes racial stratification and identify open questions where formal theory can provide more rigorous micro-foundations to these intuitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2025, statutory tariff rates on U.S. imports rose to levels not seen in over one hundred years. What are the implications for prices? On the one hand, shipping lags, exemptions, and enforcement gaps have kept the actual implemented rates at only half of the statutory rates, moderating the tariffs’ impact. On the other hand, tariff pass-through to U.S. import prices is almost 100 percent, so the United States is bearing a large share of the costs. We study the incidence of the 2018-2019 and 2025 U.S. tariffs and discuss implications for U.S. sourcing, domestic manufacturing costs, and the dollar.</content>

    <title>Why is Private lending so Popular?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private lending has exploded over the past two decades. To explore its rise, we focus on Business Development Companies (BDCs). We show that their growth is intimately connected to growth in private equity. Many BDCs are directly connected to large private equity organizations, and their compensation structures mirror those in private equity. BDCs not only provide debt for PE-sponsored deals, they make PE-like investments themselves involving deferred interest, preferred equity, and exposure to underlying assets. Understanding private lending's connections to private equity is especially salient for the rapidly growing retail investor segment and has important implications for regulation.</content>

    <title>Intergenerational Welfare Assessments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies welfare assessments in economies with rich demographics. We introduce the notion of demographically disconnected economies, those with no date at which all individuals are concurrently alive. We identify the unique class of units that always enables meaningful welfare comparisons in such economies: those based on perpetual consumption, that is, consumption at all dates. Using these units, we uncover a novel possibility: feasible perturbations of Pareto efficient allocations can yield Kaldor-Hicks efficiency gains. We also introduce a decomposition that attributes intertemporal-sharing efficiency gains to financial frictions or demographic differences. These results allow us to derive new insights in three workhorse intergenerational models: (i) Samuelson (1958) two-date-life model, offering a novel rationale for social security; (ii) Diamond (1965) growth model, providing a new theory for capital taxation and capital over-/under-accumulation; and (iii) Samuelson (1958) three-date-life model, decomposing the efficiency gains from intergenerational transfers into frictional and demographic sources.</content>

    <title>Expanding the Landscape of Cross-Border Flow Restrictions: Modern Tools and Historical Perspectives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employing large language models to analyze official documents, we construct a comprehensive record of daily changes in de jure restrictions on cross-border flows worldwide since the 1950s. Our analysis uncovers the wide array of instruments used to regulate cross-border financial flows and documents their evolving prevalence over the past seven decades. The fine granularity of the new measures allows us to characterize cross-country and time-series variation across eight categories of restrictions, further distinguishing by flow, direction, instrument type, and overall policy stance. We exploit the high frequency nature of the new data to document novel patterns in the use of these restrictions, as well as their relationship to crises, and political economy determinants. We validate our measures against established indicators of capital account regulation and show that our LLM-based classifications both replicate and substantially extend these benchmarks along multiple dimensions. Finally, we examine policymakers’ stated motivations for adopting these restrictions and account for the intensive margin of these policy actions.</content>

    <title>Bank Opacity and Deposit Rates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks face a dual mandate of raising cheap deposits while avoiding liquidity risk. We propose a novel mechanism whereby banks use portfolio opacity to meet this objective. Specifically, banks choose opaque portfolios to secure cheap long-term funding while trading off insolvency and illiquidity. We show that while opacity lowers deposit rates, it also leaves depositors with only noisy information about the bank’s solvency, making them cautious about keeping their funds in the bank—particularly when interest rates are high. We show that opacity raises bank profits, sometimes at the cost of exposure to high probability of illiquidity. In particular, in high-rate environments, banks adopt excessive opacity to further reduce deposit rates—at the cost of more frequent early failures.</content>

    <title>Broadband Internet Access and Adolescent Mental Health in the U.S.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Broadband internet has become a critical component of U.S. infrastructure, but policymakers are increasingly concerned that the widespread adoption of this technology has adversely affected adolescent mental health. To test this hypothesis, we use 2009–2019 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Survey data and leverage the nationwide rollout of broadband internet. First, we show that adolescents in states with greater broadband internet access reported spending more time online. Next, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in broadband internet access was associated with a 9.3–16.5-percent increase in adolescent suicide ideation. While we document increases in suicide ideation for both girls and boys, the results are most pronounced for adolescent girls. Exploring potential mechanisms, we show that greater broadband internet access was associated with increases in cyberbullying and body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls and a reduction in the likelihood that adolescent boys reported getting an adequate amount of sleep.</content>

    <title>Extreme Temperatures Promote High-Fat Diets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extreme temperatures threaten agriculture and exacerbate global food insecurity, yet their direct impact on dietary choices remains poorly understood. We provide novel evidence of how short-term exposures to extreme temperatures affect macronutrient intake in China. We show that both hot and cold weather elevate high-fat diet risks. In particular, hot weather reduces carbohydrate and protein consumption but not fat intake, while cold weather increases all nutrient intake, particularly fats. Temperature-induced dietary changes are shaped primarily by physiological responses to thermal stress, whereas physical activities demonstrate little effect. Technologies that improve indoor thermal comfort (via fans, air conditioners, and heating systems) substantially mitigate high-fat diet risks. Socioeconomic disparities are evident, with rural and poor individuals more likely to adopt high-fat diets under hot or cold weather. Projections indicate that more extreme temperatures due to climate change may increase the prevalence of high-fat diets nationally, while substantial regional heterogeneity emerges, with declines in northeast China and increases in southern China. These results highlight a crucial but overlooked pathway linking climate change to dietary health inequality.</content>

    <title>Quality Upgrading in Global Supply Chains: Evidence from Colombian Coffee</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do the returns to quality upgrading pass through supply chains to primary producers? We explore this question in the context of Colombia’s coffee sector, in which market outcomes depend on interactions between farmers, exporters (which operate mills), and international buyers, and contracts are for the most part not legally enforceable. We formalize the hypothesis that quality upgrading is subject to a key hold-up problem: producing high-quality beans requires long-term investments by farmers, but there is no guarantee that an exporter will pay a quality premium when the beans arrive at its mills. An international buyer with sufficient demand for high-quality coffee can solve this problem by imposing a vertical restraint on the exporter, requiring the exporter to pay a quality premium to farmers. Combining internal records from two exporters, comprehensive administrative data, and the staggered rollout of a buyer-driven quality-upgrading program, we find empirical support for the key theoretical predictions, both the lack of pass-through of quality premia under normal circumstances and the possibility of a buyer-driven solution through a vertical restraint. Calibration of the model suggests that one-third to two-thirds of the (substantial) gains from the program accrue to farmers, with the vertical restraint playing a critical role. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that quality upgrading can provide a path to higher incomes for farmers, but also that it is unlikely to be viable under standard market conditions in the sector.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effects of the first metro rail line in Mumbai using administrative data on assessed property prices from 2011-18 for 723 subzones in the city. Comparing areas within 1 km of the metro with those beyond 1 km but within 3 km, we estimate the effects on property values for commercial, industrial, and residential properties. We find a significant and persistent increase in prices of 6-8% for residential and commercial land use categories in treated areas relative to control areas after Metro Line 1 opens. We show that commute time savings and improvements in employment accessibility are plausible mechanisms underlying these effects.</content>

    <title>One Instrument, Many Treatments: Instrumental Variables Identification of Multiple Causal Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many instrumental variables applications specify a single Bernoulli treatment. But instruments may change outcomes through multiple pathways or by varying treatment intensity. Lottery instruments that boost charter school enrollment, for instance, may affect outcomes by lengthening time enrolled in a charter school and by moving students between charter schools of different types. We analyze the identification problem such scenarios present in a framework that generalizes the always-taker/never-taker/complier partition of treatment response types to cover a wide range of multinomial and ordered treatments with heterogenous potential outcomes. This framework yields novel estimators in which a single randomly assigned instrument identifies (i) causal effects averaged over complier types and (ii) a causal conditional expectation function that captures effects for each element in a set of response types. Three empirical applications demonstrate the utility of these results. The first extends an earlier analysis of the Head Start Impact Study allowing for multiple fallbacks. The second examines two causal channels for the impact of post-secondary financial aid on degree completion. The third estimates effects of additional births (an ordered treatment) on mothers’ earnings.</content>

    <title>How In-School Supervised Ed-Tech Support Produces Massive Learning Gains: A Khan Academy Field Experiment in India</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Computer-assisted learning (CAL) platforms frequently underperform at scale not because the technology is ineffective, but because schools face substantial implementation frictions: teachers and administrators must overcome initial technical hurdles, reorganize instructional routines, manage competing scheduling pressures, and do so while uncertain about the technology’s effectiveness—conditions that often lead to low and unproductive student engagement. This study explores whether strengthening implementation structure can raise both the quantity and quality of CAL usage in 83 residential government middle schools in Uttar Pradesh, India and, in turn, learning gains. All schools had access to Khan Academy, but randomly selected treatment schools received on-the-ground lab-in-charges whose sole responsibility was to ensure high-fidelity implementation by securing reliable connectivity, simplifying student rostering, protecting weekly practice time, supervising in-class use, coordinating content with teachers, and monitoring progress. The intervention increased platform usage from 7.2 to 47.4 minutes per week. Mathematics achievement rose by almost half a standard deviation over 31 weeks, with gains broad-based across achievement levels and question difficulty. These results show that the central constraint on effective and scalable CAL is not technology or content, but the presence of organizational structures that ensure sustained, productive instructional use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature has documented widespread variation in health care spending per capita across areas of the United States without correspondingly better health outcomes. Recent work has used mover designs to estimate the causal impact of place on both health care spending and mortality. In this paper, we investigate whether places that increase health care spending also tend to be places that increase health. We find that they do not and discuss the implications.</content>

    <title>Platform Work: Evidence from Drivers in India, Indonesia, and Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using surveys and administrative data from representative samples of drivers working on three leading gig platforms in India, Indonesia, and Kenya, we document the composition, economic experiences, and labor market trajectories of platform workers. Combining platform-based earnings with operating cost data, we estimate earnings net of costs (in PPP-adjusted terms) in each context. We find that the flexible nature of platform work enables drivers to work substantially more than the full-time equivalent, generating higher monthly net earnings than low-skill or casual employment, despite comparable or lower hourly net earnings relative to these outside options. Drivers who exit platform work in India and Indonesia do so to take up better-paying full-time positions. In contrast, Kenyan drivers often exit involuntarily, returning to offline driving with adverse financial consequences. One-third of drivers across countries rely on platform work to supplement earnings during emergencies or slow work periods, suggesting that platform work may play an important role as a financial safety net.</content>

    <title>Transformed Intermediation: Credit Risk to NBFIs, Liquidity Risk to Banks</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that the rapid asset growth of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) relative to banks is the outcome of transformations of risks between banks and NBFIs that increase the interconnectedness of the two sectors. These transformations are consistent with avoiding tighter, post-GFC bank regulation while harnessing the funding and liquidity advantages of bank deposit franchises and access to safety nets. Specifically, we show that banks fund NBFIs through senior loans and credit lines, which NBFIs use for acquiring junior credit claims, warehouse financing, and liquidity management. We empirically demonstrate that shocks experienced by NBFIs spillover to the banks that provide them with credit lines, particularly in times of stress. We then describe a number of policy approaches that are consistent with our transformation view and conclude with suggestions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do banks help or hamper green transition? To answer this question, we analyze the dynamics of bank lending to firms in the US, EU, and separately Denmark in relation to the borrowers' emissions of CO2. We evaluate the allocation of bank loans across industries and within industries across firms, allowing for heterogeneity of firm emissions and changes in these emissions. To facilitate green transition, bank lending needs to flow to greener and greening firms, but not out of high-emission industries that need funding to transition to cleaner production methods. Using syndicated loan data, we find that for US borrowers, bank lending was likely hampering green transition, while in the EU bank lending is more likely to facilitate it. Zooming in on Denmark, for which we have data on the full universe of firms and banks, we find more significant credit reallocation to greener firms, especially within industries. However, the reallocation of funds to green firms is, to a large extent, a byproduct of green firms becoming bigger. We do not find any evidence consistent with banks active stewardship of green transition.</content>

    <title>Do GLP-1 Medications Pay for Themselves?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) represent a major improvement in treatment of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk reduction, but they are also among the most expensive drugs in widespread use and the subject of significant policy debate. The high price of these drugs may overstate their net cost if the health improvements they produce lead to reduced downstream health care use and medical spending, that is, cost offsets. We estimate such offsets using insurance claims data, examining the effects of GLP-1 initiation on subsequent GLP-1 use and spending, and on other non-GLP-1 spending. We use a stacked difference-in-differences design, comparing patients initiating GLP-1 medication to not-yet-treated controls who initiate GLP-1s several months or years later, allowing us to control for underlying time trends and baseline characteristics. Overall, we do not find a reduction in downstream medical spending. Although GLP-1 initiation reduces spending on other diabetes medications, total non-GLP-1 spending increases, driven by higher outpatient health care use; GLP- 1 drug spending rises mechanically. For health care payers, the relevant cost of GLP-1 initiation therefore extends beyond the sticker price of the drug. We find similar results across subgroups of GLP1 initiators including those with prior cardiovascular disease and those without diabetes (consistent with obesity indication). Our main results examine spending responses over the first year after initiation. However, we also estimate longer run effects in a smaller sample and find no cost offsets even five years after GLP-1 initiation. Taken together, these results suggest that payers facing the costs of GLP-1 coverage are unlikely to see large savings from reduced spending on other care. If GLP-1 therapies ultimately yield cost savings, they are likely to occur only over longer horizons or through non-medical channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that preschools facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of conditions that can hinder learning. Low-income children born shortly before their state's school-entry cutoff date are 16.9, 9.3, and 14.8 percent more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a speech or language disorder, and a hearing or vision condition at ages three and four, compared to children born after the cutoff. They are also more likely to receive downstream services. Findings emphasize the role of earlier and longer exposure to public preschool in driving diagnostic gaps previously attributed to elementary school-entry and within-grade peer comparisons.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do investors care about why a firm behaves responsibly, over and above what the firm does and how much cash it earns? In our main experiment, participants value shares in companies that reduce pollution relative to peers, while CEOs articulate the company’s intentions: prosocial or for-profit. Investors are willing to pay more for shares in a company that takes a given prosocial action if it is motivated by social concern rather than profit maximization. This "intention premium" is distinct from the valuation effects of cash flows and environmental externalities. Respondents who are deontological, politically liberal, female, or less individualistic value the company’s intent the most. Additionally, and somewhat surprisingly, respondents view favorably firms that embrace both profit and social objectives, without ranking them. Overall, our findings temper claims that when there is no financial trade-off between doing good and doing well, shareholder value and stakeholder value maximization are equivalent.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In models with subjective beliefs, the dynamics of investor beliefs are central to explaining asset price movements. Allowing subjective beliefs to deviate from full-information rational expectations requires a model of how investors form beliefs. I review recent research that explores experience-based belief formation. The experience-based model closely resembles Bayesian updating but allows individuals to overweight data observed during their own lifetimes when forming beliefs about the parameters of the data-generating process. Because individuals of different age learn from different histories, the model predicts heterogeneity between age groups that evolves over time with the path of realized data individuals have experienced, closely mirroring the age-related variation observed in survey microdata. At the aggregate level, experience-based expectations formation can explain asset price dynamics. In the stock market, learning from experience about long-run cash flow growth generates valuation cycles and return predictability. Experience-based formation of long-term inflation expectations can explain secular changes of real interest rates. I conclude by outlining directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Weighing the Impacts of GLP-1s: Quasi-Experimental Evidence From Provider Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The arrival of GLP-1 medications has been described as one of the most important health care innovations in recent years. We provide large-scale quasi-experimental evidence on their real-world impacts by exploiting variation in the eventual prescribing propensities of patients’ pre-existing primary care providers. Using a panel intent-to-treat design, we compare outcomes for 1.4 million diabetic or obese veterans based on their 2018 provider’s eventual propensity to adopt GLP-1s, leveraging comprehensive electronic health records and biomarker data from the Veterans Health Administration, a setting with minimal insurance attrition and low-cost access to these drugs. Patients whose providers become higher propensity adopters experience substantial improvements in glycemic control and clinically meaningful weight loss; our treatment-on-the-treated estimates closely match estimates from clinical trials. Despite these metabolic benefits, we find no statistically significant effects on emergency department utilization, mental health and substance use outcomes, or non–GLP-1 medical spending through 2024.</content>

    <title>State and Time-Dependent Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new evidence on how firms set prices using direct questions from a large, economy-wide survey of UK firms. Since 2023, 54% of firms report setting prices in a state-dependent manner, as opposed to changing prices at fixed intervals. In contrast, 44% of firms used state-dependent pricing in 2019. Smaller firms, those with a higher share of non-labour costs, and those reporting higher subjective uncertainty around sales and prices are more likely to be state-dependent. We then analyse the implications of price-setting behaviour for inflation dynamics. State-dependent firms experienced a sharper increase in price growth over 2022-2023, and also a faster subsequent decline. Using evidence from a randomised survey experiment, firm-level forecast errors, and local projections, we show that prices of state-dependent firms respond faster to cost shocks. The difference between state-dependent and time-dependent firms is furthermore larger for bigger shocks, consistent with theoretical predictions.</content>

    <title>Brexit and UK Migration: Germany-Benchmarked Evidence on Structural and Reallocation Shifts</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how Brexit reshaped the volume and composition of UK migration flows. To address the inherent endogeneity of migration responses to political change, the study employs a Difference-in-Differences design that benchmarks the United Kingdom against Germany, a stable EU member unaffected by Brexit-related institutional shocks. Treating the 2016 referendum and the 2021 end of free movement as sequential shocks, the results show that migration volume increased after both shocks, but through different channels: the referendum reduced emigration relative to Germany, while the post-2021 points-based system triggered a reallocation of inflows away from EU free-movement migrants toward non-EU migrants from the rest of the world, with a markedly stronger skill-selective profile. The paper analyzes how Brexit reshaped migration flows into and out of the United Kingdom by exploiting the 2016 referendum and the 2021 termination of free movement as sequential institutional shocks. Using a Difference-in-Differences design with Germany as a stable EU benchmark, the results show that Brexit acted as a structural regime shock, not a border-tightening event. Net migration into the UK rose after both shocks—first due to a sharp post-referendum decline in emigration relative to Germany, and later due to a substantial expansion of non-EU immigration under the new points-based system. Immigration patterns exhibit a clear regime shift, with EU inflows contracting sharply after 2016 and globally sourced, skill-selective inflows rising after 2021. In the later period, a modest but notable increase in UK-born emigration relative to Germany also emerges, reflecting frictions in post-Brexit mobility. Overall, Brexit reoriented—rather than reduced—UK migration flows, transforming both their scale and composition.</content>

    <title>Global Stratification Economics (GSE): A Primer - Definitions and Research Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We coin the term Global Stratification Economics (GSE) to extend Stratification Economics (SE) to international contexts where mechanisms emerge that can be identified as (1) universal but matched to positioning along a country’s development path or (2) context-specific and historically dependent in ways different from the United States and other international environments. Building on SE’s core insight that groups compete over scarce resources and that dominant groups shape rules to preserve advantage, we define GSE as an approach that foregrounds historical genesis (e.g., settler colonialism, slavery, caste, extractive governance, military intervention), local institutions that structure dominance and resistance, and transnational mechanisms (e.g., imported stratification and the lateral mobility hypothesis) that link origin- and destination-country hierarchies. Drawing on evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the global macroeconomy, we synthesize research on intergenerational mobility, wealth and asset inequality, labor-market segmentation, colorism, caste and ethnicity, gendered and intersectional constraints, spatial inequality and property regimes, and global value chains. We conclude by outlining how GSE reshapes measurement and international policy evaluation by centering group-differentiated outcomes, institutional transformation, and pillars of recognition, redistribution, and repair and by offering a checklist for researchers to apply GSE.</content>

    <title>Nuclear Operations with a High Penetration of Renewables: The Case of France</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nuclear and intermittent renewables (wind and solar) are generally regarded as the only scalable technologies producing low-carbon electricity. However, the extent to which these technologies can co-exist in a reliable power system depends on whether nuclear units can adjust their operations to renewable output fluctuations. Using hourly data from the French power system, we find that nuclear units are operated quite flexibly, and that the foregone energy production due to “load following” actions (relative to the counterfactual of operating at full capacity during load following events) is currently limited. However, we find that an additional load following event is associated with a slightly higher likelihood of a unit failure. We also find that unit-level minimum output constraints are binding more frequently as system-wide renewable generation increases, especially so for units most exposed to solar generation. In 2024, hours during which available nuclear flexibility was exhausted are associated with non-positive hourly day-ahead prices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We deployed large language model (LLM) decision support for health workers at two outpatient clinics in Nigeria. For each patient, health workers drafted care plans that were optionally revised after LLM feedback. We compared unassisted and assisted plans using blinded randomized assessments by on-site physicians who evaluated and treated the same patients, as well as results from laboratory tests for common conditions. Academic physicians performed blinded retrospective reviews of a subset of notes. In response to LLM feedback, health workers changed their prescribing for more than half of the patients and reported high satisfaction with the recommendations, and retrospective academic reviewers rated LLM-assisted plans more favorably.  However, on-site physicians observed little to no improvement in diagnostic alignment or treatment decisions. Laboratory testing showed mixed effects of LLM-assistance, which removed negative tests for malaria but added them for urinary tract infection and anemia, with no significant increase in the detection rates for the tested conditions.</content>

    <title>Macroeconomic Impacts of Microeconomic Damages in General Equilibrium: Productivity and Capital Losses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The full economic costs and macroeconomic effects of microeconomic damages associated with pollution damages, climate impacts, and similar negative shocks are not well understood. Beyond the direct damages, market distortions, supply chains, changes in capital and labor costs, etc. can potentially magnify (or diminish) the costs of these shocks. In this paper, we use analytical and numerical general equilibrium models to investigate the channels through which microeconomic shocks affect the macroeconomy. We model different types of shocks, evaluate how anticipation affects the macroeconomic implications of shocks, and measure the overall welfare costs relative to the value of direct damages. We find that preexisting taxes magnify the overall welfare costs relative to direct damages, that savings and investment decisions driven by anticipations of certain types of shocks can interact with tax distortions to lower welfare costs, and that the ratio of welfare cost to direct damages varies substantially across sectors of the economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing evidence suggests that wealth may decline before dementia onset, but the mechanisms underlying these reductions are poorly understood. Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we compare household finance trajectories for individuals who later develop dementia and those who do not. We find that wealth divergence between the two groups is not explained by reduced earnings, higher healthcare spending, intentional “spend-down” to qualify for Medicaid coverage, state-dependent utility, or reverse causation by which wealth declines cause dementia. Instead, our results point to impaired financial decision-making beginning about six years prior to clinically recognizable dementia.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Scaling Early Childhood Programs: Lessons from The Chicago School</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many ideas show remarkable returns in small-scale trials but often disappoint when scaled to broader populations and contexts. Using early childhood investment as a case study, this study develops a dynamic human capital formation model that integrates complementary skill investment with “Option C thinking” on scaling challenges. The model is stylized in the Chicago tradition: micro-founded with optimizing agents, dynamic skill production, and a policymaker evaluating scaling decisions. It formalizes how naive extrapolation from pilot studies systematically overestimates policy efficacy by ignoring “voltage drops,” declining treatment effects due to unrepresentativeness at scale. The model demonstrates that optimal scaling policy requires mechanism-based design that anticipates these failures through backward induction from implementation realities. The scientific insights from a set of recent studies provide valuable perspectives on the model.</content>

    <title>World Trading System For Whom? Evidence from Global Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use global tariffs to reveal the weights that nations implicitly place on the welfare of their trading partners relative to their own. Our estimated welfare weights suggest that formal and informal rules of the world trading system make countries internalize the impact of their policies onto others to a substantial extent, though not fully. On average, countries place 25% less value on transfers to foreigners than transfers to their own residents. Across nations, we find that countries that put higher welfare weights on the welfare of foreigners also tend to receive higher weights from them, consistent with a general form of reciprocity among nations. Using our estimated welfare weights, we provide a first look at what countries stand to lose, or gain, from the dissolution of the world trading system as we know it.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Older home sellers receive lower returns than younger home sellers. Homes sold by older people have fewer major renovations but higher rates of poor upkeep. Older sellers are also more likely to sell off-MLS (“pocket listings”) and to sell to investors, leading to lower prices. These patterns suggest that older sellers may be disproportionately disadvantaged by agents’ incentive to maximize fees through generating high sales volume instead of maximizing sale prices. Age-related cognitive decline makes the elderly more vulnerable. For causal evidence, we show that reforms making pocket listings more transparent reduced both the prevalence of pocket listings and the magnitude of the age gap in returns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the United States. Though cannabis possession and consumption are prohibited federally, states are increasingly implementing laws that legalize this substance, initially for medical use and, more recently, for recreational use. We study the impact of recreational cannabis laws (RCLs) that allow all adults 21 years and older to legally consume and possess this substance on reports of child maltreatment and post-investigation service use. To do so, we combine difference-in-differences methods with administrative data on child maltreatment reports 2010-2022. Overall, we find no evidence that child maltreatment reports or service use are influenced by RCL adoption, though we find that physical abuse reports decline. Our findings indicate that recent efforts to legalize cannabis for recreational consumption have not led to an increase in child maltreatment reports.</content>

    <title>Does Advertising Expand the Market for Hospital Services? Evidence from Medicare</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Direct-to-consumer advertising is pervasive in US healthcare markets, but little evidence exists on the effects of advertising by hospitals, second only to drug manufacturers in medical marketing. Advertising may help facilities increase market share by stealing existing patients, expand the market for hospital care, or do both. Regardless, it has important public finance implications due to the large sums of taxpayer funds spent by federal and state governments to subsidize hospital operations and finance care through public insurance programs. This paper provides the first causal evidence, to our knowledge, on the market expansion effects of hospital advertising. To obtain causal estimates, we leverage the fact that spikes in political advertising significantly crowd out hospital advertising in the same market, motivating an instrumental variables design. Using claims data on the universe of Traditional Medicare beneficiaries, we find that advertising expands aggregate patient volume and spending on inpatient care – though to a modest degree (implied elasticities of 0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Although the overall effect of advertising on hospital outpatient care is muted, for-profit hospitals obtain higher outpatient Medicare volume and revenue with greater advertising. Across both care settings, therefore, Medicare spending increases with hospital advertising.</content>

    <title>How Globalization Unravels: A Ricardian Model of Endogenous Trade Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how uneven gains from globalization can endogenously generate protectionism as a political equilibrium. Using U.S. data, we document that regions more exposed to import competition display stronger opposition to globalization, especially among households with little financial wealth, and that firms in trade-exposed sectors sharply increase lobbying expenditures. To interpret these patterns, we develop and quantify a general equilibrium Ricardian model with heterogeneous households, input-output linkages, and endogenous trade policy shaped by voting and lobbying. Distributional shocks reallocate political support among voters, while lobbying propagates through production networks, generating strategic complementarities that sustain protectionism. Calibrated to U.S.-China sectoral data from 1991--2019, the model accounts for rising inequality, declining support for globalization, and key aggregate trends in consumption and trade.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Parole Supervision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impacts of a reform to parole supervision in Illinois. The reform reduced the term of supervision for some parolees from 12 months to 6 months while many similar parolees continued to receive 12 months of supervision. We evaluate the impact of the reform using a standard difference-in-differences estimator, and we find clear evidence that the reform reduced prison re-entry rates. Sharp drops in rates of technical revocations drove these reductions. Rates of prison re-admissions linked to new crimes did not change. We merge data from Cook County Courts with our data on state prison admissions and releases, and we find no evidence that the reform increased crime rates among parolees. The reform reduced both the cost of incarceration and the cost of parolee supervision without creating harms to public safety.</content>

    <title>With or Without U? Binning Bias and the Causal Effects of Temperature Extremes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Estimates of climate impacts show that extreme temperatures have large and wide-spread effects. To estimate these effects, a common approach counts days in different temperature ranges and considers how exposure to these distinct 'bins' affects outcomes. This often produces non-linear, U-shaped results, in which high and low temperatures have the largest effects. We show that non-linear approaches like these can generate spurious findings. Specifically, global warming induces trends in extreme temperature exposure that correlate mechanically with a location's baseline temperature. Substantial bias emerges if trends in the outcome variable also correlate with baseline temperature for any reason. We demonstrate this problem theoretically, in simulations, and with real outcomes. We then develop solutions. In applications using US data, some results in the literature are unaffected by these corrections, while other results change substantially.</content>

    <title>Effective Protection with Global Value Chains</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effective rate of protection (ERP) is a widely-used tool to evaluate the joint impact of input and output tariffs on the net protection offered to individual sectors. Nonetheless, the theoretical foundations underlying the traditional ERP are decades out of date. In this paper, we provide fresh guidance for policy analysts that seek to measure effective protection, with two core elements. First, we develop a new ERP concept, which measures how much tariffs shift the derived demand for real value added at the sector level. The ERP then has an intuitive interpretation: it is the effective subsidy to buyers of sectoral value added that replicates the impact of the tariff structure on demand. Second, we demonstrate how to compute our ERP index accounting for global value chain linkages. The result is an ERP for the GVC age, in which effective protection depends on the structure of value chains across countries and sectors, and the structure of all tariffs applied globally. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by analyzing how recent tariff changes have altered effective protection in the United States and the rest of the world.</content>

    <title>Price Discrimination with Costless Resale</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that income effects create an endogenous barrier to arbitrage, allowing price discrimination to survive costless resale. A monopolist sells an indivisible good to consumers with heterogeneous incomes who can freely resell. When the good is strictly normal, a consumer's reservation price to resell increases as the purchase price decreases—lower prices leave buyers wealthier and raise their valuation of the good. The monopolist exploits this by subsidising low-income consumers to raise their reservation prices to a target that high-income consumers must also pay. The optimal schedule increases dollar-for-dollar with income in the subsidised segment, weakly dominates uniform pricing, and achieves the first-best allocation when the entire market is served. We show the mechanism extends beyond income effects: low substitutability with market alternatives generates large reservation-price responses even when income sensitivity is modest. Sustaining discrimination requires market power at the individual level—consumer-specific quantity limits—not merely aggregate output restrictions. Extensions examine multiple monopolists and endogenous privacy choices.</content>

    <title>Automation Experiments and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many experiments study the productivity effects of automation technologies such as generative algorithms. A key test in these experiments relates to inequality: does the technology increase output more for high- or low-skill workers? However, the theoretical content of this empirical test has been unclear. Here, we formalize a theory that describes the experimental effect of automation technologies on worker-level output and, therefore, inequality. Worker-level output depends on a task-level production function, and workers are heterogeneous in their task-level skills. Workers perform a task themselves or delegate it to the automation technology. The inequality effect of improved automation depends on the interaction of two factors: (i) the correlation in task-level skills across workers, and (ii) workers' skills relative to the technology's effective skill. In many cases we study, the inequality effect is non-monotonic --- as technologies improve, inequality decreases then increases. The model and descriptive statistics of skill correlations generally suggest that the diversity of automation technologies will play an important role in the evolution of inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we explore whether the recent pension reforms enacted in Italy had an impact on the inequality in health among individuals. We construct a set of indexes measuring several health outcomes (both physical and mental) and analyze their evolution along time (across SHARE waves) from 2004 to 2022, by relating them to the households’ income. While we can observe some differences in the health-income gradient between genders, we do not find evidence of a positive relationship between the introduction of the pension reforms and an increase in inequality.</content>

    <title>The first 1000 days and beyond: The process of child development.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews recent developments in the economics of human development, focusing on the early years of life as a critical period for shaping long-term outcomes. Early childhood development is inherently multidimensional: cognitive and socioemotional skills evolve dynamically and interact with health, nutrition, and environmental influences. Economists have contributed to this field by providing a conceptual unifying framework that highlights how key drivers of development reflect the choices of individuals operating under incentives and constraints. Within this framework, the paper emphasizes two central challenges: understanding the interactions among multiple dimensions of development and identifying causal links - particularly the effects of different inputs at different ages. Measurement issues are a recurring theme, given the difficulty of assessing young children and the need for comparability across contexts. The paper also stresses these issues’ policy relevance for poverty reduction and social mobility by discussing early childhood interventions in both developed and developing countries.</content>
