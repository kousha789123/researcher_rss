    <title>One Instrument, Many Treatments: Instrumental Variables Identification of Multiple Causal Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many instrumental variables applications specify a single Bernoulli treatment. But instruments may change outcomes through multiple pathways or by varying treatment intensity. Lottery instruments that boost charter school enrollment, for instance, may affect outcomes by lengthening time enrolled in a charter school and by moving students between charter schools of different types. We analyze the identification problem such scenarios present in a framework that generalizes the always-taker/never-taker/complier partition of treatment response types to cover a wide range of multinomial and ordered treatments with heterogenous potential outcomes. This framework yields novel estimators in which a single randomly assigned instrument identifies (i) causal effects averaged over complier types and (ii) a causal conditional expectation function that captures effects for each element in a set of response types. Three empirical applications demonstrate the utility of these results. The first extends an earlier analysis of the Head Start Impact Study allowing for multiple fallbacks. The second examines two causal channels for the impact of post-secondary financial aid on degree completion. The third estimates effects of additional births (an ordered treatment) on mothers’ earnings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We deployed large language model (LLM) decision support for health workers at two outpatient clinics in Nigeria. For each patient, health workers drafted care plans that were optionally revised after LLM feedback. We compared unassisted and assisted plans using blinded randomized assessments by on-site physicians who evaluated and treated the same patients, as well as results from laboratory tests for common conditions. Academic physicians performed blinded retrospective reviews of a subset of notes. In response to LLM feedback, health workers changed their prescribing for more than half of the patients and reported high satisfaction with the recommendations, and retrospective academic reviewers rated LLM-assisted plans more favorably.  However, on-site physicians observed little to no improvement in diagnostic alignment or treatment decisions. Laboratory testing showed mixed effects of LLM-assistance, which removed negative tests for malaria but added them for urinary tract infection and anemia, with no significant increase in the detection rates for the tested conditions.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Scaling Early Childhood Programs: Lessons from The Chicago School</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many ideas show remarkable returns in small-scale trials but often disappoint when scaled to broader populations and contexts. Using early childhood investment as a case study, this study develops a dynamic human capital formation model that integrates complementary skill investment with “Option C thinking” on scaling challenges. The model is stylized in the Chicago tradition: micro-founded with optimizing agents, dynamic skill production, and a policymaker evaluating scaling decisions. It formalizes how naive extrapolation from pilot studies systematically overestimates policy efficacy by ignoring “voltage drops,” declining treatment effects due to unrepresentativeness at scale. The model demonstrates that optimal scaling policy requires mechanism-based design that anticipates these failures through backward induction from implementation realities. The scientific insights from a set of recent studies provide valuable perspectives on the model.</content>

    <title>How In-School Supervised Ed-Tech Support Produces Massive Learning Gains: A Khan Academy Field Experiment in India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Computer-assisted learning (CAL) platforms frequently underperform at scale not because the technology is ineffective, but because schools face substantial implementation frictions: teachers and administrators must overcome initial technical hurdles, reorganize instructional routines, manage competing scheduling pressures, and do so while uncertain about the technology’s effectiveness—conditions that often lead to low and unproductive student engagement. This study explores whether strengthening implementation structure can raise both the quantity and quality of CAL usage in 83 residential government middle schools in Uttar Pradesh, India and, in turn, learning gains. All schools had access to Khan Academy, but randomly selected treatment schools received on-the-ground lab-in-charges whose sole responsibility was to ensure high-fidelity implementation by securing reliable connectivity, simplifying student rostering, protecting weekly practice time, supervising in-class use, coordinating content with teachers, and monitoring progress. The intervention increased platform usage from 7.2 to 47.4 minutes per week. Mathematics achievement rose by almost half a standard deviation over 31 weeks, with gains broad-based across achievement levels and question difficulty. These results show that the central constraint on effective and scalable CAL is not technology or content, but the presence of organizational structures that ensure sustained, productive instructional use.</content>

    <title>Re-Examining Geographic Variation in Health and Health Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature has documented widespread variation in health care spending per capita across areas of the United States without correspondingly better health outcomes. Recent work has used mover designs to estimate the causal impact of place on both health care spending and mortality. In this paper, we investigate whether places that increase health care spending also tend to be places that increase health. We find that they do not and discuss the implications.</content>

    <title>Platform Work: Evidence from Drivers in India, Indonesia, and Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using surveys and administrative data from representative samples of drivers working on three leading gig platforms in India, Indonesia, and Kenya, we document the composition, economic experiences, and labor market trajectories of platform workers. Combining platform-based earnings with operating cost data, we estimate earnings net of costs (in PPP-adjusted terms) in each context. We find that the flexible nature of platform work enables drivers to work substantially more than the full-time equivalent, generating higher monthly net earnings than low-skill or casual employment, despite comparable or lower hourly net earnings relative to these outside options. Drivers who exit platform work in India and Indonesia do so to take up better-paying full-time positions. In contrast, Kenyan drivers often exit involuntarily, returning to offline driving with adverse financial consequences. One-third of drivers across countries rely on platform work to supplement earnings during emergencies or slow work periods, suggesting that platform work may play an important role as a financial safety net.</content>

    <title>Transformed Intermediation: Credit Risk to NBFIs, Liquidity Risk to Banks</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that the rapid asset growth of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) relative to banks is the outcome of transformations of risks between banks and NBFIs that increase the interconnectedness of the two sectors. These transformations are consistent with avoiding tighter, post-GFC bank regulation while harnessing the funding and liquidity advantages of bank deposit franchises and access to safety nets. Specifically, we show that banks fund NBFIs through senior loans and credit lines, which NBFIs use for acquiring junior credit claims, warehouse financing, and liquidity management. We empirically demonstrate that shocks experienced by NBFIs spillover to the banks that provide them with credit lines, particularly in times of stress. We then describe a number of policy approaches that are consistent with our transformation view and conclude with suggestions for future research.</content>

    <title>Firm Emissions and Credit Allocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do banks help or hamper green transition? To answer this question, we analyze the dynamics of bank lending to firms in the US, EU, and separately Denmark in relation to the borrowers' emissions of CO2. We evaluate the allocation of bank loans across industries and within industries across firms, allowing for heterogeneity of firm emissions and changes in these emissions. To facilitate green transition, bank lending needs to flow to greener and greening firms, but not out of high-emission industries that need funding to transition to cleaner production methods. Using syndicated loan data, we find that for US borrowers, bank lending was likely hampering green transition, while in the EU bank lending is more likely to facilitate it. Zooming in on Denmark, for which we have data on the full universe of firms and banks, we find more significant credit reallocation to greener firms, especially within industries. However, the reallocation of funds to green firms is, to a large extent, a byproduct of green firms becoming bigger. We do not find any evidence consistent with banks active stewardship of green transition.</content>

    <title>Do GLP-1 Medications Pay for Themselves?</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) represent a major improvement in treatment of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk reduction, but they are also among the most expensive drugs in widespread use and the subject of significant policy debate. The high price of these drugs may overstate their net cost if the health improvements they produce lead to reduced downstream health care use and medical spending, that is, cost offsets. We estimate such offsets using insurance claims data, examining the effects of GLP-1 initiation on subsequent GLP-1 use and spending, and on other non-GLP-1 spending. We use a stacked difference-in-differences design, comparing patients initiating GLP-1 medication to not-yet-treated controls who initiate GLP-1s several months or years later, allowing us to control for underlying time trends and baseline characteristics. Overall, we do not find a reduction in downstream medical spending. Although GLP-1 initiation reduces spending on other diabetes medications, total non-GLP-1 spending increases, driven by higher outpatient health care use; GLP- 1 drug spending rises mechanically. For health care payers, the relevant cost of GLP-1 initiation therefore extends beyond the sticker price of the drug. We find similar results across subgroups of GLP1 initiators including those with prior cardiovascular disease and those without diabetes (consistent with obesity indication). Our main results examine spending responses over the first year after initiation. However, we also estimate longer run effects in a smaller sample and find no cost offsets even five years after GLP-1 initiation. Taken together, these results suggest that payers facing the costs of GLP-1 coverage are unlikely to see large savings from reduced spending on other care. If GLP-1 therapies ultimately yield cost savings, they are likely to occur only over longer horizons or through non-medical channels.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Preschool Entry Age on Children’s Behavioral and Developmental Health in Medicaid</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that preschools facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of conditions that can hinder learning. Low-income children born shortly before their state's school-entry cutoff date are 16.9, 9.3, and 14.8 percent more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a speech or language disorder, and a hearing or vision condition at ages three and four, compared to children born after the cutoff. They are also more likely to receive downstream services. Findings emphasize the role of earlier and longer exposure to public preschool in driving diagnostic gaps previously attributed to elementary school-entry and within-grade peer comparisons.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do investors care about why a firm behaves responsibly, over and above what the firm does and how much cash it earns? In our main experiment, participants value shares in companies that reduce pollution relative to peers, while CEOs articulate the company’s intentions: prosocial or for-profit. Investors are willing to pay more for shares in a company that takes a given prosocial action if it is motivated by social concern rather than profit maximization. This "intention premium" is distinct from the valuation effects of cash flows and environmental externalities. Respondents who are deontological, politically liberal, female, or less individualistic value the company’s intent the most. Additionally, and somewhat surprisingly, respondents view favorably firms that embrace both profit and social objectives, without ranking them. Overall, our findings temper claims that when there is no financial trade-off between doing good and doing well, shareholder value and stakeholder value maximization are equivalent.</content>

    <title>Experiences, Expectations, and Asset Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In models with subjective beliefs, the dynamics of investor beliefs are central to explaining asset price movements. Allowing subjective beliefs to deviate from full-information rational expectations requires a model of how investors form beliefs. I review recent research that explores experience-based belief formation. The experience-based model closely resembles Bayesian updating but allows individuals to overweight data observed during their own lifetimes when forming beliefs about the parameters of the data-generating process. Because individuals of different age learn from different histories, the model predicts heterogeneity between age groups that evolves over time with the path of realized data individuals have experienced, closely mirroring the age-related variation observed in survey microdata. At the aggregate level, experience-based expectations formation can explain asset price dynamics. In the stock market, learning from experience about long-run cash flow growth generates valuation cycles and return predictability. Experience-based formation of long-term inflation expectations can explain secular changes of real interest rates. I conclude by outlining directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Weighing the Impacts of GLP-1s: Quasi-Experimental Evidence From Provider Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The arrival of GLP-1 medications has been described as one of the most important health care innovations in recent years. We provide large-scale quasi-experimental evidence on their real-world impacts by exploiting variation in the eventual prescribing propensities of patients’ pre-existing primary care providers. Using a panel intent-to-treat design, we compare outcomes for 1.4 million diabetic or obese veterans based on their 2018 provider’s eventual propensity to adopt GLP-1s, leveraging comprehensive electronic health records and biomarker data from the Veterans Health Administration, a setting with minimal insurance attrition and low-cost access to these drugs. Patients whose providers become higher propensity adopters experience substantial improvements in glycemic control and clinically meaningful weight loss; our treatment-on-the-treated estimates closely match estimates from clinical trials. Despite these metabolic benefits, we find no statistically significant effects on emergency department utilization, mental health and substance use outcomes, or non–GLP-1 medical spending through 2024.</content>

    <title>State and Time-Dependent Pricing</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new evidence on how firms set prices using direct questions from a large, economy-wide survey of UK firms. Since 2023, 54% of firms report setting prices in a state-dependent manner, as opposed to changing prices at fixed intervals. In contrast, 44% of firms used state-dependent pricing in 2019. Smaller firms, those with a higher share of non-labour costs, and those reporting higher subjective uncertainty around sales and prices are more likely to be state-dependent. We then analyse the implications of price-setting behaviour for inflation dynamics. State-dependent firms experienced a sharper increase in price growth over 2022-2023, and also a faster subsequent decline. Using evidence from a randomised survey experiment, firm-level forecast errors, and local projections, we show that prices of state-dependent firms respond faster to cost shocks. The difference between state-dependent and time-dependent firms is furthermore larger for bigger shocks, consistent with theoretical predictions.</content>

    <title>Brexit and UK Migration: Germany-Benchmarked Evidence on Structural and Reallocation Shifts</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Assaf Razin</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how Brexit reshaped the volume and composition of UK migration flows. To address the inherent endogeneity of migration responses to political change, the study employs a Difference-in-Differences design that benchmarks the United Kingdom against Germany, a stable EU member unaffected by Brexit-related institutional shocks. Treating the 2016 referendum and the 2021 end of free movement as sequential shocks, the results show that migration volume increased after both shocks, but through different channels: the referendum reduced emigration relative to Germany, while the post-2021 points-based system triggered a reallocation of inflows away from EU free-movement migrants toward non-EU migrants from the rest of the world, with a markedly stronger skill-selective profile. The paper analyzes how Brexit reshaped migration flows into and out of the United Kingdom by exploiting the 2016 referendum and the 2021 termination of free movement as sequential institutional shocks. Using a Difference-in-Differences design with Germany as a stable EU benchmark, the results show that Brexit acted as a structural regime shock, not a border-tightening event. Net migration into the UK rose after both shocks—first due to a sharp post-referendum decline in emigration relative to Germany, and later due to a substantial expansion of non-EU immigration under the new points-based system. Immigration patterns exhibit a clear regime shift, with EU inflows contracting sharply after 2016 and globally sourced, skill-selective inflows rising after 2021. In the later period, a modest but notable increase in UK-born emigration relative to Germany also emerges, reflecting frictions in post-Brexit mobility. Overall, Brexit reoriented—rather than reduced—UK migration flows, transforming both their scale and composition.</content>

    <title>Global Stratification Economics (GSE): A Primer - Definitions and Research Implications</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We coin the term Global Stratification Economics (GSE) to extend Stratification Economics (SE) to international contexts where mechanisms emerge that can be identified as (1) universal but matched to positioning along a country’s development path or (2) context-specific and historically dependent in ways different from the United States and other international environments. Building on SE’s core insight that groups compete over scarce resources and that dominant groups shape rules to preserve advantage, we define GSE as an approach that foregrounds historical genesis (e.g., settler colonialism, slavery, caste, extractive governance, military intervention), local institutions that structure dominance and resistance, and transnational mechanisms (e.g., imported stratification and the lateral mobility hypothesis) that link origin- and destination-country hierarchies. Drawing on evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the global macroeconomy, we synthesize research on intergenerational mobility, wealth and asset inequality, labor-market segmentation, colorism, caste and ethnicity, gendered and intersectional constraints, spatial inequality and property regimes, and global value chains. We conclude by outlining how GSE reshapes measurement and international policy evaluation by centering group-differentiated outcomes, institutional transformation, and pillars of recognition, redistribution, and repair and by offering a checklist for researchers to apply GSE.</content>

    <title>Nuclear Operations with a High Penetration of Renewables: The Case of France</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nuclear and intermittent renewables (wind and solar) are generally regarded as the only scalable technologies producing low-carbon electricity. However, the extent to which these technologies can co-exist in a reliable power system depends on whether nuclear units can adjust their operations to renewable output fluctuations. Using hourly data from the French power system, we find that nuclear units are operated quite flexibly, and that the foregone energy production due to “load following” actions (relative to the counterfactual of operating at full capacity during load following events) is currently limited. However, we find that an additional load following event is associated with a slightly higher likelihood of a unit failure. We also find that unit-level minimum output constraints are binding more frequently as system-wide renewable generation increases, especially so for units most exposed to solar generation.

    <title>Macroeconomic Impacts of Microeconomic Damages in General Equilibrium: Productivity and Capital Losses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The full economic costs and macroeconomic effects of microeconomic damages associated with pollution damages, climate impacts, and similar negative shocks are not well understood. Beyond the direct damages, market distortions, supply chains, changes in capital and labor costs, etc. can potentially magnify (or diminish) the costs of these shocks. In this paper, we use analytical and numerical general equilibrium models to investigate the channels through which microeconomic shocks affect the macroeconomy. We model different types of shocks, evaluate how anticipation affects the macroeconomic implications of shocks, and measure the overall welfare costs relative to the value of direct damages. We find that preexisting taxes magnify the overall welfare costs relative to direct damages, that savings and investment decisions driven by anticipations of certain types of shocks can interact with tax distortions to lower welfare costs, and that the ratio of welfare cost to direct damages varies substantially across sectors of the economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing evidence suggests that wealth may decline before dementia onset, but the mechanisms underlying these reductions are poorly understood. Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we compare household finance trajectories for individuals who later develop dementia and those who do not. We find that wealth divergence between the two groups is not explained by reduced earnings, higher healthcare spending, intentional “spend-down” to qualify for Medicaid coverage, state-dependent utility, or reverse causation by which wealth declines cause dementia. Instead, our results point to impaired financial decision-making beginning about six years prior to clinically recognizable dementia.</content>

    <title>World Trading System For Whom? Evidence from Global Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use global tariffs to reveal the weights that nations implicitly place on the welfare of their trading partners relative to their own. Our estimated welfare weights suggest that formal and informal rules of the world trading system make countries internalize the impact of their policies onto others to a substantial extent, though not fully. On average, countries place 25% less value on transfers to foreigners than transfers to their own residents. Across nations, we find that countries that put higher welfare weights on the welfare of foreigners also tend to receive higher weights from them, consistent with a general form of reciprocity among nations. Using our estimated welfare weights, we provide a first look at what countries stand to lose, or gain, from the dissolution of the world trading system as we know it.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Older home sellers receive lower returns than younger home sellers. Homes sold by older people have fewer major renovations but higher rates of poor upkeep. Older sellers are also more likely to sell off-MLS (“pocket listings”) and to sell to investors, leading to lower prices. These patterns suggest that older sellers may be disproportionately disadvantaged by agents’ incentive to maximize fees through generating high sales volume instead of maximizing sale prices. Age-related cognitive decline makes the elderly more vulnerable. For causal evidence, we show that reforms making pocket listings more transparent reduced both the prevalence of pocket listings and the magnitude of the age gap in returns.</content>

    <title>Legalizing Cannabis: Implications for Child Maltreatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the United States. Though cannabis possession and consumption are prohibited federally, states are increasingly implementing laws that legalize this substance, initially for medical use and, more recently, for recreational use. We study the impact of recreational cannabis laws (RCLs) that allow all adults 21 years and older to legally consume and possess this substance on reports of child maltreatment and post-investigation service use. To do so, we combine difference-in-differences methods with administrative data on child maltreatment reports 2010-2022. Overall, we find no evidence that child maltreatment reports or service use are influenced by RCL adoption, though we find that physical abuse reports decline. Our findings indicate that recent efforts to legalize cannabis for recreational consumption have not led to an increase in child maltreatment reports.</content>

    <title>Does Advertising Expand the Market for Hospital Services? Evidence from Medicare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Direct-to-consumer advertising is pervasive in US healthcare markets, but little evidence exists on the effects of advertising by hospitals, second only to drug manufacturers in medical marketing. Advertising may help facilities increase market share by stealing existing patients, expand the market for hospital care, or do both. Regardless, it has important public finance implications due to the large sums of taxpayer funds spent by federal and state governments to subsidize hospital operations and finance care through public insurance programs. This paper provides the first causal evidence, to our knowledge, on the market expansion effects of hospital advertising. To obtain causal estimates, we leverage the fact that spikes in political advertising significantly crowd out hospital advertising in the same market, motivating an instrumental variables design. Using claims data on the universe of Traditional Medicare beneficiaries, we find that advertising expands aggregate patient volume and spending on inpatient care – though to a modest degree (implied elasticities of 0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Although the overall effect of advertising on hospital outpatient care is muted, for-profit hospitals obtain higher outpatient Medicare volume and revenue with greater advertising. Across both care settings, therefore, Medicare spending increases with hospital advertising.</content>

    <title>How Globalization Unravels: A Ricardian Model of Endogenous Trade Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how uneven gains from globalization can endogenously generate protectionism as a political equilibrium. Using U.S. data, we document that regions more exposed to import competition display stronger opposition to globalization, especially among households with little financial wealth, and that firms in trade-exposed sectors sharply increase lobbying expenditures. To interpret these patterns, we develop and quantify a general equilibrium Ricardian model with heterogeneous households, input-output linkages, and endogenous trade policy shaped by voting and lobbying. Distributional shocks reallocate political support among voters, while lobbying propagates through production networks, generating strategic complementarities that sustain protectionism. Calibrated to U.S.-China sectoral data from 1991--2019, the model accounts for rising inequality, declining support for globalization, and key aggregate trends in consumption and trade.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Parole Supervision</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impacts of a reform to parole supervision in Illinois. The reform reduced the term of supervision for some parolees from 12 months to 6 months while many similar parolees continued to receive 12 months of supervision. We evaluate the impact of the reform using a standard difference-in-differences estimator, and we find clear evidence that the reform reduced prison re-entry rates. Sharp drops in rates of technical revocations drove these reductions. Rates of prison re-admissions linked to new crimes did not change. We merge data from Cook County Courts with our data on state prison admissions and releases, and we find no evidence that the reform increased crime rates among parolees. The reform reduced both the cost of incarceration and the cost of parolee supervision without creating harms to public safety.</content>

    <title>With or Without U? Binning Bias and the Causal Effects of Temperature Extremes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Estimates of climate impacts show that extreme temperatures have large and wide-spread effects. To estimate these effects, a common approach counts days in different temperature ranges and considers how exposure to these distinct 'bins' affects outcomes. This often produces non-linear, U-shaped results, in which high and low temperatures have the largest effects. We show that non-linear approaches like these can generate spurious findings. Specifically, global warming induces trends in extreme temperature exposure that correlate mechanically with a location's baseline temperature. Substantial bias emerges if trends in the outcome variable also correlate with baseline temperature for any reason. We demonstrate this problem theoretically, in simulations, and with real outcomes. We then develop solutions. In applications using US data, some results in the literature are unaffected by these corrections, while other results change substantially.</content>

    <title>Effective Protection with Global Value Chains</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Emily J. Blanchard, Mitchell W. Boice &amp; Robert C. Johnson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effective rate of protection (ERP) is a widely-used tool to evaluate the joint impact of input and output tariffs on the net protection offered to individual sectors. Nonetheless, the theoretical foundations underlying the traditional ERP are decades out of date. In this paper, we provide fresh guidance for policy analysts that seek to measure effective protection, with two core elements. First, we develop a new ERP concept, which measures how much tariffs shift the derived demand for real value added at the sector level. The ERP then has an intuitive interpretation: it is the effective subsidy to buyers of sectoral value added that replicates the impact of the tariff structure on demand. Second, we demonstrate how to compute our ERP index accounting for global value chain linkages. The result is an ERP for the GVC age, in which effective protection depends on the structure of value chains across countries and sectors, and the structure of all tariffs applied globally. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by analyzing how recent tariff changes have altered effective protection in the United States and the rest of the world.</content>

    <title>Price Discrimination with Costless Resale</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that income effects create an endogenous barrier to arbitrage, allowing price discrimination to survive costless resale. A monopolist sells an indivisible good to consumers with heterogeneous incomes who can freely resell. When the good is strictly normal, a consumer's reservation price to resell increases as the purchase price decreases—lower prices leave buyers wealthier and raise their valuation of the good. The monopolist exploits this by subsidising low-income consumers to raise their reservation prices to a target that high-income consumers must also pay. The optimal schedule increases dollar-for-dollar with income in the subsidised segment, weakly dominates uniform pricing, and achieves the first-best allocation when the entire market is served. We show the mechanism extends beyond income effects: low substitutability with market alternatives generates large reservation-price responses even when income sensitivity is modest. Sustaining discrimination requires market power at the individual level—consumer-specific quantity limits—not merely aggregate output restrictions. Extensions examine multiple monopolists and endogenous privacy choices.</content>

    <title>Automation Experiments and Inequality</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many experiments study the productivity effects of automation technologies such as generative algorithms. A key test in these experiments relates to inequality: does the technology increase output more for high- or low-skill workers? However, the theoretical content of this empirical test has been unclear. Here, we formalize a theory that describes the experimental effect of automation technologies on worker-level output and, therefore, inequality. Worker-level output depends on a task-level production function, and workers are heterogeneous in their task-level skills. Workers perform a task themselves or delegate it to the automation technology. The inequality effect of improved automation depends on the interaction of two factors: (i) the correlation in task-level skills across workers, and (ii) workers' skills relative to the technology's effective skill. In many cases we study, the inequality effect is non-monotonic --- as technologies improve, inequality decreases then increases. The model and descriptive statistics of skill correlations generally suggest that the diversity of automation technologies will play an important role in the evolution of inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we explore whether the recent pension reforms enacted in Italy had an impact on the inequality in health among individuals. We construct a set of indexes measuring several health outcomes (both physical and mental) and analyze their evolution along time (across SHARE waves) from 2004 to 2022, by relating them to the households’ income. While we can observe some differences in the health-income gradient between genders, we do not find evidence of a positive relationship between the introduction of the pension reforms and an increase in inequality.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews recent developments in the economics of human development, focusing on the early years of life as a critical period for shaping long-term outcomes. Early childhood development is inherently multidimensional: cognitive and socioemotional skills evolve dynamically and interact with health, nutrition, and environmental influences. Economists have contributed to this field by providing a conceptual unifying framework that highlights how key drivers of development reflect the choices of individuals operating under incentives and constraints. Within this framework, the paper emphasizes two central challenges: understanding the interactions among multiple dimensions of development and identifying causal links - particularly the effects of different inputs at different ages. Measurement issues are a recurring theme, given the difficulty of assessing young children and the need for comparability across contexts. The paper also stresses these issues’ policy relevance for poverty reduction and social mobility by discussing early childhood interventions in both developed and developing countries.</content>

    <title>Monopsony, Markdowns, and Minimum Wages</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents the first direct test of two interlinked predictions at the core of the monopsony theory of the labor market: (i) that firms exploit wage-setting power by marking down wages below the marginal revenue product of labor, and (ii) that exogenous wage constraints, if binding, eliminate markdowns. Our research design revisits the 2015 introduction of a high minimum wage in Germany. Drawing on a monopsony model, we derive an empirically tractable difference-in-differences specification that provides a quantitative benchmark for the firm-level markdown response. Our main result is that empirical markdowns respond only 0–25% as much as the monopsony model would have predicted. Hence, at least for the labor market segment we study, (i) markdowns largely reflect other distortions than monopsony, (ii) markdowns are mismeasured, (iii) minimum wages induce widespread labor shortages, or (iv) the standard monopsony model does not provide a full, realistic account of the labor market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure how frontier research frames what is normatively at stake along the efficiency and equity dimension. We develop and validate an LLM-based measurement pipeline and apply it to 27,464 full-text journal articles from 1950 to 2021. Efficiency focused framing rises through the late 1980s, then declines as equity related framing expands after 1990, especially in applied work and policy evaluations. By 2021, papers with an equity component are about as common as papers framed purely around efficiency. President transmittal letters in the Economic Report of the President show a similar post 1990 shift toward equity, providing an external benchmark.</content>

    <title>A Model of Artificial Jagged Intelligence</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI systems often display highly uneven performance across tasks that appear “nearby”: they can be excellent on one prompt and confidently wrong on another with only small changes in wording or context. We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about local reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model “knows” scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering “where the model works” is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Structural economic models, while parsimonious and interpretable, often exhibit poor data fit and limited forecasting performance. Machine learning models, by contrast, offer substantial flexibility but are prone to overfitting and weak out-of-distribution generalization. We propose a theory-guided transfer learning framework that integrates structural restrictions from economic theory into machine learning models. The approach pre-trains a neural network on synthetic data generated by a structural model and then fine-tunes it using empirical data, allowing potentially misspecified economic restrictions to inform and regularize learning on empirical data. Applied to option pricing, our model substantially outperforms both structural and purely data-driven benchmarks, with especially large gains in small samples, under unstable market conditions, and when model misspecification is limited. Beyond performance, the framework provides diagnostics for improving structural models and introduces a new model-comparison metric based on data-model complementarity.</content>

Higher investment by FinTech firms is not accounted for by sectoral focus or differences in firm age. Reasons for higher customer capital investment are explored, including the need to build trust with customers, the focus on downstream segments of the financial marketplace, the operation of platform-based business models, and a heavier reliance on valuable customer data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the promising opportunities offered by AI to support the decarbonization of electricity grids is to align demand with low-carbon supply. We evaluated the effects of one of the world’s largest AI managed EV charging tariffs (a retail electricity pricing plan) using a large-scale natural field experiment. The tariff dynamically controlled vehicle charging to follow real-time wholesale electricity prices and coordinate and optimize charging for the grid and the consumer through AI. We randomized financial incentives to encourage enrollment onto the tariff. Over more than a year, we found that the tariff led to a 42% reduction in household electricity demand during peak hours, with 100% of this demand shifted to lower-cost and lower-carbon-intensity periods. The tariff generated substantial consumer savings, while demonstrating potential to lower producer costs, energy system costs, and carbon emissions through significant load shifting. Overrides of the AI algorithm were low, suggesting that this tariff was likely more efficient than a real-time-pricing tariff without AI, given our theoretical framework. We found similar plug-in and override behavior in several markets, including the UK, US, Germany, and Spain, implying the potential for comparable demand and welfare effects. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable AI managed charging and its substantial welfare gains for the electricity system and society. We also show that experimental estimates differed meaningfully from those obtained via non-randomized difference-in-differences analysis, due to differences in the samples in the two evaluation strategies, although we can reconcile the estimates with observables.</content>

    <title>Pricing Residential Mortgage Credit Risk in the Post-GFC Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), the Credit Risk Transfer (CRT) bond market emerged as a new asset class in U.S.  mortgage market. We develop an asset pricing framework for CRTs consistent with Treasury, corporate bond, and housing markets. Our analysis reveals that the Government-Sponsored Enterprises compensate investors approximately fairly on average, though they overpay for low-risk tranches and underpay for high-risk ones. Additionally, the post-GFC guarantee fee increases broadly align with underlying credit risk. We find significant reverse cross-subsidization, where high-credit-risk borrowers subsidize low-risk ones. The 2023 reform partially corrected this cross-subsidization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We collect new data to document the long-run evolution of the firm size distribution in ten market-based economies in Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania, where we can obtain comprehensive coverage of the population of firms. Around the world, we observe prevalent increases in the concentration of sales, net income, and equity capital over the past century. These trends hold in the aggregate and at the industry level. Meanwhile, employment concentration has been stable over the long run in most cases. The evidence shows that the rising dominance of large firms is a pervasive phenomenon, not limited to the recent decades or the United States, and that large firms often achieve greater scale without proportionally more workers.</content>

    <title>Never Enough: Dynamic Status Incentives in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the ability of a firm to elicit repeated effort from workers by creating a “rat race” of hierarchical status-based incentives. We examine performance using data on over 5,000 German air force pilots during World War II. Pilots’ effort is hard to monitor; motivation is key to success. Fighter pilot performance increases markedly as they approach eligibility for a medal before falling off upon receipt of the award. The same effort path repeats itself as the pilot nears the next higher-prestige medal. Status-conscious pilots also exert more effort when new medals are introduced. We show that medals serve as substitutes for other forms of status. Medal cachet declines over time as lower-ability pilots receive them, making the introduction of new medals desirable. These results suggest that a tiered, expanding system of status-based incentives can repeatedly leverage worker status concerns to extract effort.</content>

    <title>Marginal Admission to Elite High Schools: Long-run Effects on Labor Market Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-run effects of marginal admission to elite public high schools on students' labor supply in the context of Mexico City's centralized high school admission system. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we compare students whose placement exam scores are just above and just below the elite admission threshold. We find that five and ten years after the admission exam, marginally admitted students are less likely to be employed in the formal private sector, and, if employed, they earn lower wages. However, these employment and wage gaps close after 15 years. Moreover, we find that marginal admission to elite high schools leads to delayed entry into the formal labor market, and, at least in the short run, students in elite high schools seem to sort into lower-productivity firms and industries.</content>

    <title>How Adaptable Are American Workers to AI-Induced Job Displacement?</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sam J. Manning &amp; Tomás Aguirre</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct an occupation-level adaptive capacity index that measures a set of worker characteristics relevant for navigating job transitions if displaced, covering 356 occupations that represent 95.9% of the U.S. workforce. We find that AI exposure and adaptive capacity are positively correlated: many occupations highly exposed to AI contain workers with relatively strong means to manage a job transition. Of the 37.1 million workers in the top quartile of AI exposure, 26.5 million are in occupations that also have above-median adaptive capacity, leaving them comparatively well-equipped to handle job transitions if displacement occurs. At the same time, 6.1 million workers (4.2% of the workforce in our sample) work in occupations that are both highly exposed and where workers have low expected adaptive capacity. These workers are concentrated in clerical and administrative roles. Importantly, AI exposure reflects potential changes to work tasks, not inevitable displacement; only some of the changes brought on by AI will result in job loss. By distinguishing between highly exposed workers with relatively strong means to adjust and those with limited adaptive capacity, our analysis shows that exposure measures alone can obscure both areas of resilience to technological change and concentrated pockets of elevated vulnerability if displacement were to occur.</content>

    <title>Tenure-Dependent Severance Costs and Labor Market Dynamics over the Life Cycle</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the labor market effects of tenure-dependent severance pay systems that tie firing costs to workers’ accumulated earnings histories. We develop an overlapping-generations search-and-matching model in which firms face increasing separation costs over the employment relationship. Using administrative employer–employee data from Brazil, we estimate the model and show that tenure-dependent severance costs induce labor hoarding among low-productivity, long-tenured workers who would not be hired if unemployed. These distortions are strongest late in the life cycle, when firms optimally delay separation to avoid severance obligations, while simultaneously imposing higher hiring thresholds on older unemployed workers with shorter continuation values. These forces imply that tenure-based severance policies protect employment histories rather than productivity, shaping labor market dynamics over the life cycle and generating allocative inefficiencies.</content>

    <title>Aggregate Productivity with Discrete Choice</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies aggregate productivity in general equilibrium economies where agents with heterogeneous preferences make discrete choices between locations and occupations. We show how the conventional tools of welfare economics, like cost-benefit analysis, can be extended to these settings. Following Debreu (1951), we measure the change in aggregate productivity as the maximum reduction in total factor productivity such that it is possible to make every household at least indifferent to their status quo allocation. Aggregate productivity rises if primary factors can be saved while keeping every household at least indifferent. We characterize this measure of efficiency in terms of compensated supply and demand curves. We show that, to a first-order approximation, the elasticity of aggregate productivity to productivity shocks is given by sales shares (regardless of preferences and technologies). We also provide second-order approximations in terms of elasticities of uncompensated supply and demand curves. We contrast our approach with some popular alternative measures of aggregate efficiency and welfare: real GDP, the cross-sectional average of utilities, and the sum of compensating variations, and show that these alternative measures have serious flaws.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prediction markets offer a new market-based approach to measuring macroeconomic expectations in real-time. We evaluate the accuracy of prediction market-implied forecasts from Kalshi, the largest federally regulated prediction market overseen by the CFTC. We compare Kalshi with more traditional survey and market-implied forecasts, examine how expectations respond to macroeconomic and financial news, and how policy signals are interpreted by market participants. Our results suggest that Kalshi markets provide a high-frequency, continuously updated, distributionally rich benchmark that is valuable to both researchers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>Research to Improve the Quality, Impact, and Value of Home and Community-Based Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly eight million Americans use Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) to support long-term services and supports for people with disabilities. Recent legislative changes to Medicaid will require states to make difficult choices about how best to meet these long-term services and supports needs. This paper first characterizes the unique goals of HCBS, which differ from those of traditional medical care services, and the state-federal financing and administrative structure of HCBS. Next, based on a review of the literature and input from a panel of experts in HCBS policy and research, we summarize existing evidence and knowledge gaps regarding the quality and cost implications of HCBS at the federal, state, and direct service provision levels. Based on gaps in the evidence, we propose a research agenda related to state-federal incentives, state program choices regarding HCBS financing and delivery models, and the settings and supports for direct service provision. Finally, we describe existing and novel data sources and other opportunities that could accelerate research to fill these evidence gaps and support states and others in designing, implementing, and delivering sustainable, high-quality HCBS.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work requirements are often criticized for imposing administrative burdens that reduce access to benefits, yet prior research has struggled to isolate this mechanism from other sources of disenrollment. This paper provides direct evidence by examining procedural denials in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We study work requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) and exploit age-based exemptions that apply to individuals aged 50 and older. Using administrative data and difference-in-differences models leveraging waiver periods, we find that work requirements significantly increase procedural and overall denials. Our results indicate that these policies deter participation through imposed administrative burdens.</content>

    <title>The Distributional Effects of Cost-Sharing in a Universal Healthcare System</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Patient cost-sharing is used as a tool to limit over-utilization of insured healthcare services in almost all high-income countries. We study its distributional consequences in the context of a publicly-funded universal health insurance system, where consumers (as tax-payers) are residual claimants on insurer spending. We highlight the distinction between consumers' elasticity of demand for healthcare services—which moderates how cost-sharing rules affect healthcare utilization—and their baseline level of demand—which moderates how cost-sharing rules affect out-of-pocket costs. Using detailed administrative data on the Norwegian national health insurance scheme, we study a 2010 policy change that raised the age threshold for cost-sharing exemption, thereby increasing patient cost-sharing substantially for adolescents. We find that females and native-born Norwegians have higher average utilization and thus have more at stake financially from cost-sharing, but are relatively less responsive to cost-sharing. In contrast, lower-income individuals as well as individuals with a chronic health condition have both higher average healthcare utilization as well as higher responsiveness. Cost-sharing therefore places a larger burden on these groups both in terms of the financial cost of out-of-pocket spending and in terms of reduced quantities of healthcare used.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how political parties affect representation in the U.S. House. To do so, I account for party pressure on the votes of members in an otherwise standard spatial model that uses roll call voting patterns to identify member ideologies. I simultaneously estimate voter ideologies from survey responses, leveraging their responses on issues before Congress to bridge voters and members into the same ideological space. I find that, relative to a model without party pressure, member ideologies and those of their constituents are much more closely aligned. The results imply that, in terms of actual votes, parties drive a wedge between members and those they represent. I provide evidence that parties do so strategically, balancing the need for legislative wins and the electoral concerns of their members.</content>

    <title>Why is the Mental Health of the Youngest American Workers in Decline?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The worsening mental health of young workers in the United States drives the disappearance of the U-shape in wellbeing and the hump-shape in illbeing in the last decade.  Illbeing declines in age among workers but is hump-shaped among non-workers across all US states. This has been the case for some time and is apparent in our analyses of two large US datasets with long time runs - the Behavioral Risk Survey System 1993-2025 and the National Health Interview Survey of 1997-2024. Although the mental health of workers and non-workers has been declining it has been deteriorating most quickly among young workers, leading to a steepening in the age gradient of mental illbeing for workers. Improvements in worker wellbeing (and declines in worker illbeing) with age are mirrored in age differences in reported working conditions in the American Job Quality Survey of 2025: six measures of job quality rise with age.  Declines in mental health are most pronounced among the youngest workers ages 18-22 who are likely drawn from lower socio-economic classes and report the greatest difficulties making ends meet.</content>

    <title>Hitting Rock Bottom: Economic Hardship and Cheating</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates whether economic hardship undermines preferences for honesty. We use controlled, high-stake measures of cheating for private benefit in a large sample of 5,664 Kenyans, exploiting three complementary sources of variation: experimentally manipulated monetary incentives to cheat, a randomized increase in the salience of one’s own financial situation, and the Covid‐19 income shock (exploiting randomized survey timing, with respondents interviewed before vs. during the crisis). We find that cheating behavior is highly responsive to financial incentives in the experiment. Covid-19 economic hardship—marked by a 51% drop in monthly earnings—leads to a sharp increase in the prevalence of cheating, and the effect increases gradually with prolonged hardship. The effects are largest among the most economically impacted and are amplified when the salience of one’s own financial situation is experimentally increased. The results demonstrate that while most individuals exhibit a strong preference against cheating under normal conditions (in line with the existing body of work), economic forces can account for a substantial share of variation in dishonesty: the estimated cheating rate rises from 29% under low stakes in normal times to 86% under high stakes during the crisis.</content>

    <title>The Geography of Science</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Science has long been concentrated in the Western world, but the global research landscape is undergoing a profound reorganization. Using data on 44 million publications from 1980 to 2022, we document the geography of science in terms of who produces it, what it studies, and where it diffuses. The share of publications produced in the United States has fallen from 40% in 1980 to 15% in 2022, while China’s share has risen from near-zero to 32%. This pattern extends even to elite outlets, with China now producing over 35% of top-journal publications. Notably, this is driven not only by an expanding researcher base but also—to a large extent—by increases in individual productivity. This growth varies by fields: China leads in the Engineering and Physical Sciences (such as Chemistry), while the US retains its lead in Biomedical and Health Sciences. Moreover, China’s expanding leadership in scientific production has not translated into a commensurate shift in global diffusion and integration. Elite research remains disproportionately focused on US topics (40% of breakthrough publications), and citations to Chinese research disproportionately come from within China rather than from other regions, even for top-tier science. Similar to China, other middle- and low-income countries (including India, Russia, and Brazil) have also expanded output producing as much research as high-income European Union countries combined (about 21% overall) but they remain underrepresented in top-tier journals. Overall, our findings highlight both the democratization and fragmentation of global science, raising important questions about the future of the global scientific enterprise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We define the concept of customer overlap of product j with product k as the share of j's customers who buy k. We then argue that, in appropriate contexts, customer overlaps are an excellent proxy for diversion ratios, a useful and popular way to summarize competition between sellers of substitute products. Unlike diversion ratios, which are often challenging to estimate, customer overlaps are straightforwardly observed in many data sets. We show theoretically, and then validate empirically, the close connection between customer overlaps and diversion ratios. We then illustrate the potential use of customer overlap in contexts where estimation of diversion ratios could be prohibitive.</content>

The largest rise in service employment has occurred in non-tradable consumer services, such as retail and hospitality, especially in urban areas, where many cities resemble consumer hubs built around local demand. These patterns of growth raise fundamental questions: Can service-led growth sustain a growth of living standards over time? Is service-led growth inherently biased toward affluent urban consumers? What role should policy play? We propose a parsimonious general equilibrium framework that incorporates non-homothetic preferences and locally non-tradable consumer services. Our framework bridges macro and micro perspectives, and enables counterfactual and welfare analysis that accounts for both individual and spatial heterogeneity. We relate our framework to the recent literature and suggest several extensions and directions of future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents new survey evidence on how household spending changes in response to fiscal transfers. Our key finding is that the planned propensity to spend out of transfers equals the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). This result implies that households do not incorporate future tax liabilities into their spending plans. The canonical HANK model cannot account for our survey results because people in that model are overly sensitive to future tax liabilities. We develop an extended HANK model in which households are partially inattentive to future tax liabilities and to the general-equilibrium consequences of fiscal policy. This inattention dampens forward-looking intertemporal MPCs, bringing the model into line with our survey evidence. We use the model to analyze the aggregate effects of fiscal policy changes and find that both transfer and government spending multipliers are larger in the inattentive HANK model than in the canonical HANK framework.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efforts to move care out of hospitals and into the community face a hard constraint: while most medications can be delivered anywhere, diagnosis is still mostly trapped inside the formal health system—clinics, hospitals, and the people and machines inside them. This is especially binding in low- and middle-income countries due to distance, cost, and limited health system capacity. Low-cost data collection devices (e.g., handheld electrocardiograms (ECGs), retinal cameras) are promising, but do not solve the bottleneck: their outputs still require expert interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) could turn these raw signals into actionable outputs at scale, but most medical AI is trained in high-income settings and deteriorates in different populations and settings. We assemble a new dataset in rural Tamil Nadu, India that links low-cost device signals to hospital-grade reference testing. We use it to build a proof-of-concept screening tool: an algorithm that predicts the result of a hospital-based reference-standard test (regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography), using only data from a handheld ECG device (cost: $60). This would allow targeting of secondary prevention medications—high-dose statins, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers—proven to be cost-effective in both high- and low-resource settings. We evaluate predictive performance and cost-effectiveness of such screening, benchmarking against common clinical risk scores (including the American Heart Association 10-year risk score). In a held-out test set, our model identifies subgroups with rates high enough to make screening very cost-effective: the top 2.5% have a 9.3% rate of evidence consistent with prior heart attack—about six times the base rate—delivering benefits at US$1,999 per life-year saved. The model also flags high-yield patients who would be missed by standard clinical scores, underscoring the limits of transporting Western-derived risk tools to low- and middle-income settings. To enable extensions to other conditions in the dataset, we make all data freely available for research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the increased cross-country ownership of financial assets between advanced and emerging economies impacted their financial and macroeconomic volatility. While cross-country ownership improved risk-sharing and reduced volatility associated with financial crises, it also increased the exposure of countries to foreign crises, leading to higher international co-movement. Through quantitative applications of a two-region model representative of advanced and emerging economies, we find that financial globalization reduced volatility worldwide, but significantly more in emerging economies.</content>

    <title>Capital Flows in a World Starved for Liquidity: Analysis and Policy Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a framework for studying financial and macroeconomic dynamics in an environment where liquid assets have a productive use but their supply is limited (i.e., the economy is starved for liquidity). The private demand for financial assets arises from the need to hold them for production. The private supply of financial assets is limited and unstable because of borrowing constraints and default risk. We discuss open-economy applications that analyze the accumulation of foreign reserves by emerging economies, the increase in public debt issued by advanced economies, the rapid growth of emerging economies, structural changes in financial markets, and financial globalization. A key result is that most of these developments led to a decline in interest rates and an increase in global macroeconomic volatility, driven by riskier borrower portfolios.</content>

    <title>How Restrictive is U.S. Trade Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This short note computes Trade Restrictiveness Index measures for current U.S. trade policy. Building on the ideas of Anderson and Neary (1996, 2005), the Trade Restrictiveness Index is the uniform tariff that leaves the U.S. consumer as well off as under actual policy. As of October 2025, U.S. trade policy is twice as restrictive as headline tariff numbers suggest. The Trade Restrictiveness Index is 23 percent, which stands in contrast to the 11 percent average tariff rate. Trade policy towards Canada and Mexico is two to three times more restrictive than average tariff rates suggest. Sectoral analysis shows that the restrictiveness is concentrated in vehicles, machinery, and electrical equipment.</content>

    <title>Unlocking Occupational Opportunity: The Labor Market Effects of DACA</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U.S. laws make it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented migrants. This legal constraint affects which firms will employ unauthorized workers and what jobs undocumented migrants can expect to get. As a result, unauthorized migrants are more likely to end up in jobs that have a lower risk of detection of immigration status and are less desirable. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which began in August 2012, gave temporary legal authorization to work in the U.S. to a subset of undocumented migrants – those who arrived in the U.S. as children meeting certain other eligibility criteria. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the effect of DACA on the occupational outcomes of young adults who arrived in the U.S. as children. Applying this strategy to individual-level data from the American Community Survey, we find that DACA eligibility decreases the likelihood that noncitizen childhood immigrants hold traditional immigrant jobs or jobs with a high risk of injury, and increases the likelihood of holding a government job or jobs that require occupational licensing. On the whole, DACA eligibility shifts noncitizen childhood immigrants to occupations that are higher-paying and employ more educated workers. These findings are consistent with legal barriers constraining undocumented childhood migrants from taking the jobs they are interested in and have the skills for. These workers are shunted to jobs they find less desirable and there are societal losses from the misallocation of talent.</content>

    <title>Community College Bachelor’s Degrees: How CCB Graduates’ Earnings Compare to AAs and BAs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first descriptive analysis of the economic value of Community College Baccalaureate (CCB) degrees by examining graduates’ early-career earnings, the costs of completing these programs, and the alignment between field of study and subsequent employment. Using administrative data and controlling for institution and field, we find that CCB graduates earn $4,000 to $9,000 more annually than Associate’s (AA) degree holders one year after graduation but experience average earnings penalties of roughly $2,000 relative to traditional Bachelor’s (BA) recipients. These averages mask substantial heterogeneity: penalties are largest in Computer and Information Technology and Engineering Technology, whereas CCB graduates in Nursing, other Healthcare fields, Business, and Criminal Justice exhibit minimal or no penalties. To contextualize these returns, we analyze tuition and fee structures across CCB-granting institutions and identify two dominant pricing models—constant and escalating. Total CCB program costs fall between those of AA and BA degrees, with escalating structures increasing upper-division prices by about 40 percent. Finally, we examine field-to-industry match patterns and find that CCB graduates in fields with well-defined occupational pathways, such as Health Professions and Education, are highly concentrated in aligned industries, while graduates in more diffuse fields, such as Computer Science, are more broadly dispersed.</content>

    <title>Subcontracting in Federal Spending: Micro and Macro Implications</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the critical but underexplored role of subcontracting in shaping the spatial and firm-level effects of federal government spending. Using newly available data on defense subcontract awards linked to establishment-level data from NETS, we examine prime–subcontractor relationships across regions, industries, and over time. We document three key facts. First, subcontracting reallocates a substantial share of federal dollars across geographic areas, weakening the link between the location of prime contracts and where spending ultimately occurs. Second, subcontracting shifts spending across industries, notably from service-sector primes to manufacturing subcontractors. Third, large firms dominate subcontracting networks, including by receiving subcontracts from smaller primes. Accounting for geographic reallocation implies that conventional estimates understate local fiscal multipliers by about 20%. Furthermore, local multipliers are smaller for subcontracting than for prime contracting, partly because subcontracted spending is concentrated among large manufacturing firms that exhibit more muted employment responses. Establishment-level evidence further shows that subcontracting generates weaker employment effects, even conditional on firm size and industry, reflecting the less stable nature of subcontracting relationships. Overall, our findings show that subcontracting fundamentally reshapes the transmission of procurement spending through the private sector, with important implications for the local and aggregate effects of federal spending.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on 100 million transactions, we show how speculators, hedgers, and market makers interact in the world’s largest FX derivatives market, and that derivatives trading can affect exchange rates. Firms in the largest client sectors—pension and investment funds, insurers, and nonfinancials—use FX derivatives primarily to hedge currency risk, with dealer banks providing the liquidity. Hedge funds, with comparatively smaller net exposures, trade speculatively, whereas dealer banks insulate themselves from changes in speculative demand by taking offsetting positions with hedgers, especially nonfinancials. Non-bank market makers, instead, take residual exchange-rate exposures “on the margin”. Hedge funds’ speculative flows help transmit monetary policy shocks to exchange rates, while investment funds' unwinding of hedges contribute to dollar appreciations when credit risk rises. Our results highlight that exchange rates depend on the composition of trading activities in FX derivatives markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We outline a research agenda for behavioral development economics that seeks to understand the role of psychological channels in: (i) impeding individuals' ability to climb out of poverty, and (ii) shaping the organization of production, functioning of markets, and role of informal institutions in developing countries.  We apply a missing markets lens to rationalize why tools, products and services that help individuals overcome their biases will be under-supplied by the market and why behavioral biases can have large impacts in steady state, even among highly experienced agents. We argue that these biases are especially likely to matter for the field of development because core features of poverty---proximity to subsistence, high volatility,  market failures,  weak formal institutions, and reliance on social ties---amplify the impact of psychological constraints. We organize our review around a core set of psychological constructs: self-control, cognitive constraints, self-beliefs, mental health, and social norms. For each construct, we highlight places where there is only a proof of concept versus evidence of meaningful impacts, and the resultant implications for future research. We also highlight where social capital can be deployed to mitigate the impacts of missing markets. The field research to date has only begun to scratch the surface in document how psychological mechanisms affect behavior and decision-making, and substantial scope remains for future work to determine whether these constraints play a first-order role in shaping poverty.</content>

    <title>Understanding Latin America’s Fertility Decline: Age, Education, and Cohort Dynamics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the sharp decline in fertility across Latin America using both period and cohort measures. Combining Vital Statistics, Census microdata, and UN population data, we decompose changes in fertility by age, education, and joint age–education groups. We show that the decline in period fertility between 2000 and 2022 is driven primarily by reductions in within-group birth rates rather than by changes in population composition, with the largest contributions coming from younger and less-educated women. Comparing the cohort born in the mid 1950s and the one born in the mid 1970s, we find that the decline in completed fertility reflects not only delayed childbearing but also substantial reductions in the average number of children per woman. This is driven primarily by lower fertility among mothers rather than by rising childlessness. Our findings provide new evidence on the nature of Latin America’s transition to below-replacement fertility and highlight several open questions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When do people identify with their class? Evidence from social psychology shows that individuals are more likely to identify with a group if they are similar to its members. We study early 20th century Britain and show that regional cultural heterogeneity combined with internal migration influenced class identity. We develop and validate a measure of class identity using naming decisions. Exploiting within-household variation, we show that migration patterns that increased the local share of culturally-distant workers reduced working class identification. Where migration increased the cultural distance of the working class, workers were less likely to join unions, voters were less likely to support the nascent Labour Party, and parliamentary candidates were less likely to target working class voters. By 1911, slower in-migration and rising local population growth reduced working class distance in urban areas, which also became strongholds of support for Labour. Migration alters social identity and creates political cleavages.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic development relies on and transforms the environment. The transformation is evident in the poor environmental quality in many developing countries. For example, air quality in Southeast Asia is three times worse than in the United States, in sub-Saharan Africa four times worse and in South Asia more than six times worse. We model how environmental quality affects health, productivity and well-being and how individuals privately adapt to environmental hazards. We also model how collective action and formal regulation contribute to environmental quality. We draw three main findings from a review of empirical research on these mechanisms. First, individual adaptation to environmental hazards is both inadequate as a remedy and inefficiently low. Second, collective action, without the state, to manage resources or address externalities has been outstripped by the scale of environmental problems. Third, state action through formal regulation works better than it looks. Many formal regulations are coarse, poorly targeted and inefficient, but nonetheless yield benefits in excess of their costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first global, long-run evidence on how war reshapes democratic institutions. Using data on all conflicts since 1948, we show that the onset of conflict causes a large and persistent decline in democracy: institutions weaken immediately, continue to erode for nearly a decade, and do not recover. Yet this deterioration is highly selective. It appears only in first-time conflicts, intrastate wars, highly fractionalized societies, and conflicts that governments win. The decline operates through political channels – media censorship, judicial purges, curtailed civil liberties, irregular leadership turnover, and constitutional suspensions - rather than through any functional requirement of war-making. Autocratization does not increase the probability of victory, and institutional instability reduces it. Taken together, the findings show that war does not require autocracy; it enables executives to expand their authority and implement institutional changes that would be difficult to enact in peacetime.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive dataset of posts from a major platform for anime- and manga-style artwork, we study the impact of the launch of a prominent text-to-image generative AI. Focusing on the majority of incumbent creators who do not adopt AI as a primary tool, we show that the AI launch led to a significant decline in post uploads by illustrators, whereas comic artists were less affected, reflecting the need for tight stylistic alignment across sequential images in comics. We present empirical evidence for two underlying mechanisms. First, illustration posts experience a loss of viewer attention, measured by bookmarks, following the AI launch, which can significantly harm creators’ business models. Second, direct competition from AI-generated content plays an important role: illustrators working on intellectual properties (IPs, such as Pokémon) that are more heavily invaded by AI reduce their uploads disproportionately more. We further examine creators’ responses and show that illustrators with greater exposure to AI avoid using tags favored by AI-generated content after the AI launch and broaden the range of IPs they work on, consistent with a risk-hedging response to AI invasion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate nearly steady trends from 1973-2023 in the U.S. in the timing of when people work for pay, away from evening and night hours toward “usual” daytime hours. The trend is related to changes in rising educational attainment, to increased real incomes, and the increased wage premium for undesirable work times—evenings and nights—that we document. The trend exists in all major industries except retail, in which changes in technology biased work away from daytime hours. The trend was accelerated by the sharp increase in telework that occurred after the Covid pandemic, an increase that was especially concentrated during daytime hours. While we observe the same phenomenon in France from 1966 to 2010, we do not in the U.K. from 1974-2015, arguably because of the very sharp decline in unionization in the U.K. and the changes in retailing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate heterogeneous responses to top-bracket tax reforms using a triple-difference design that exploits variation in tax rate changes and the thresholds at which they apply. This strategy identifies behavioral responses even in the presence of unobservable shocks to the income distribution. Higher-income taxpayers respond more to top-rate changes, but our results indicate that this reflects the salience of the reforms—the larger mechanical change in average tax rates at higher incomes—rather than heterogeneity in substitution elasticities. We discuss implications for the revenue and distributional effects of top-bracket tax reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How borrowers respond to future changes in the interest rate on their debt matters for the transmission of monetary policy and for household financial stability. Combining bank data, a letter RCT, and a survey, we study this question in the context of the German mortgage market, where since 2022 borrowers have faced high interest rates when their rate fixation period ends. We find that borrower actions substantially reduce the impact of higher rates on monthly payments. Survey responses corroborate high informedness and a strong propensity to prepare for rate changes. The letter intervention does not affect rate beliefs but increases awareness of available options and refinancing among borrowers close to expiration of their rate fixation.</content>

    <title>Industrial Activity, State Capacity, and Deforestation: Evidence from Brazil</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does industrial activity drive deforestation and land degradation, and can limited state capacity be overcome to decouple economic growth from environmental harm? We examine these questions in the context of slaughterhouse plant openings in Brazil from 1994 to 2019. Guided by a simple conceptual framework and using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that plant openings increase livestock production while reducing forest cover and degrading pastureland. However, following the introduction of legally enforceable, incentive-compatible agreements between slaughterhouses and federal prosecutors—which penalize purchases of livestock from illegally deforested areas but act as a green certification mechanism—plant openings increase productivity without driving deforestation. Our findings suggest that tying firm performance to environmental goals through market-aligned legal mechanisms can generate economic and environmental gains at low cost to the government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional valuation metrics for the U.S. stock market based on a comparison of the aggregate market value of U.S. corporations to measures of dividends, earnings, output, and the replacement cost of measured capital have been above historical norms for the past 25–30 years. Will they return to their historical means? We use macroeconomic data to argue that the observed decline in labor’s share of corporate output in conjunction with relatively weak corporate investment mechanically generates a persistent rise in the ratio of corporate valuation relative to corporate earnings, even absent any changes in expected returns or growth rates.</content>

    <title>A Few Bad Apples? Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.</content>

    <title>Effective and Scalable Programs to Facilitate Labor Market Transitions for Women in Technology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate two interventions facilitating technology-sector transitions for women in Poland: Mentoring, focused on expanding professional networks, and Challenges, focused on building credible skill signals. Randomizing oversubscribed admissions, we find both programs substantially increase technology employment at twelve months-by 15 percentage points for Mentoring and 11 p.p. for Challenges. The distinct mechanisms through which the programs operate translate to heterogeneous treatment effects across geography, career stage, and baseline credentials. These differential effects create scope for improved allocation: algorithmic targeting across programs outperforms random assignment by 86% and outperforms experts' selection into Mentoring by 11%.</content>

    <title>Scaling Sustainable Investing in Emerging and Developing Economies: Frictions and Opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mobilizing private capital at scale is critical for financing sustainable development, particularly in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), where capital is most needed. We conduct a global survey of senior investment decision-makers across a broad spectrum of capital providers, including asset managers, pension and sovereign wealth funds, development finance institutions, philanthropic investors, and others. The survey provides novel evidence on investors’ risk-return expectations, risk perceptions, and investment practices in EMDEs and in blended finance structures. We document four main findings. First, conditional on investor type, return expectations in EMDEs are comparable to those in developed markets, suggesting that categorical exclusions of EMDE assets might be inefficient. Second, investors’ dominant risk perceptions—particularly currency and political risks—are poorly aligned with the de-risking tools commonly employed in blended finance. Third, prevailing approaches to evaluating blended finance rely on both input- and outcome-based metrics, yet with limited measurement of financial and impact additionality. Fourth, our results highlight organizational and informational frictions, rather than unattractive financial fundamentals, as key barriers to scaling sustainable investing in EMDEs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), exhibit systematic behavioral biases in economic and financial decisions? If so, how can these biases be mitigated? Drawing on the cognitive psychology and experimental economics literatures, we conduct the most comprehensive set of experiments to date—originally designed to document human biases—on prominent LLM families across model versions and  scales. We document systematic patterns in LLM behavior. In preference-based tasks, responses become more human-like as models become more advanced or larger, while in belief-based tasks, advanced large-scale models frequently generate rational responses. Prompting LLMs to make rational decisions reduces biases.</content>

    <title>The United States as an Active Industrial Policy Nation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document and characterize a new history of U.S. federal-level industrial policies by scanning all 12,167 Congressional Acts and 6,030 Presidential Orders from 1973 through 2022. We find several interesting patterns. First, contrary to a common perception, the United States has always been an active industrial policy nation throughout the period, regardless of which party is in power, with 5.4 laws and 3.4 Presidential Orders per year on average containing new industrial policies. Second, we identify roughly 300% more instances of industrial policies than those in the Global Trade Alert (GTA) database during 2008-2022, despite using essentially the same definition. Third, industrial policies in practice are as likely to be justified by national security as by economic competitiveness. Fourth, many U.S. industrial policies incorporate design features that help mitigate potential drawbacks, such as explicit expiration dates and pilot programs for emerging technologies. Finally, based on stock market reactions and firm performance, the identified policies are recognized as economically significant in shifting resource allocations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage Becker’s time allocation theory to examine consumer demand and market competition for time-intensive goods. The Beckerian model predicts higher diversion ratios for goods with substantial time shares and those with high time costs relative to monetary prices. Applying this model to data from two field experiments, we analyze demand for Facebook and Instagram, focusing on substitution patterns across online activities and offline time use. Our findings indicate that users exhibit low elasticity to ad load, the primary user cost, and that time shares and time costs significantly influence diversion ratios. We explore the implications for user costs and benefits on these platforms and assess the potential impact of a Federal Trade Commission-proposed de-merger of Facebook and Instagram.</content>

    <title>The Demand for Grandchildren: Children as Family Public Goods and Implications for Cooperative Bargaining</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The title says it all. Well, almost all. To economists, the situation suggests bargaining between parents and grandparents, where the grandparents can "bribe" the parents to have more children or to have children sooner than they otherwise would. Because cash transfers seem inappropriate, bribes are likely to take the form of promises of child care or down payments on houses. Coasian bargaining or, more generally, cooperative bargaining models with their explicit assumption of Pareto efficiency offer accessible off-the shelf models. Larger family size (e.g., the participation of both pairs of grandparents) and family complexity (e.g., resulting from divorce and repartnering in the parents' generation or the grandparents' generation) threaten the assumption of zero or low transaction costs. Low transaction costs, explicit in the Coasian analysis and implicit in cooperative game theory's assumption of Pareto efficiency, play a crucial role. The generalization of family economics from the analysis of bargaining between spouses to include family members beyond the household will at some point require replacing Coasian and cooperative bargaining with models of noncooperative bargaining.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Retail Deposit Balances</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the dynamics of household deposits using account-level data from 12 million accounts across 154 U.S. credit unions. Significant skewness in the retail deposit distribution–with 10% of depositors controlling 70% of total deposits–means large-balance accounts drive aggregate retail deposit flows. On average, high-balance accounts become large after significant one-time inflows and are more likely to experience large, idiosyncratic drawdowns. Unlike low-balance households, high-balance retail depositors are not sensitive to interest rate shocks. Additional evidence suggests that overall retail deposit stickiness is driven by high-balance accounts that are used as medium-run liquidity stores rather than for interest income.</content>

    <title>The Informational Role of Emission Markets: Prices vs Quantities with Dispersed Information About Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study asymmetric information about the social cost of an externality, as opposed to asymmetric information about private costs of abatement. I show that quantity regulation with bankable permits has an informational advantage because the permit market aggregates dispersed information about social costs. It has the disadvantage of making private costs more uncertain ex ante. I analytically derive the expression for the (dis)advantage of prices over quantities in this setting. I show that a quantity policy can dominate a price policy for any slope of marginal private costs and always dominates when marginal private costs are sufficiently flat.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper discusses a fundamental problem in measuring the growth of knowledge and comparing the skills of people. New skills emerge that are not just more of the previously acquired skills. Psychometric convention forces these skills into arbitrarily constructed scales, which can severely distort measurement. To formally address this problem, we measure skills using a novel measurement scheme, estimate a stochastic learning process and reject the common scale assumption across levels for language and cognitive skills. Furthermore, we estimate dynamic complementarity without imposing arbitrary scales for skills.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how college major choices shape earnings and fertility outcomes. Using administrative data that link students' preferences, random assignment to majors, and post-college outcomes, we estimate the causal pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to different fields of study. We document substantial heterogeneity in these returns across majors and show that such variation helps explain gender gaps in labor market outcomes: women place greater weight on balancing career and family in their major choices, and these preference differences account for about 30% of the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Last, we use our causal estimates to evaluate the effects of counterfactual assignment rules that target representation gaps in settings with centralized assignment systems. We find that gender quotas in high-return fields can significantly reduce representation and earnings gaps with minimal impacts on efficiency and aggregate fertility.</content>

    <title>No Taxation Without Administration: Bringing The State Back Into The Public Finance Of Developing Countries</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The empirical economics literature on taxation in developing countries has centered on the importance of third-party information for enforcement. Yet, while surely a long-run objective, leveraging such information remains out of reach in many developing countries due to largely informal economies and low state capacity. This article examines an emerging complementary literature focused on strengthening the 'sinews' of state capacity: tax administration. We argue that reforms to the organizational structure, personnel management, and task management of tax authorities have potential to raise tax capacity in developing countries. We also argue that efforts to improve the state's legitimacy – popular acceptance of its right to tax – can increase capacity and may complement investments in tax administration. Our approach bridges a long-standing divide between how scholars in public finance and political economy approach tax capacity building in developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how tariff uncertainty affects exchange rates, motivated by the U.S. dollar’s depreciation after the 2025 tariff announcements. Standard macro-trade models predict that unilateral tariffs appreciate the implementing country’s currency, but we show this result can be overturned by policy uncertainty. We build a two-country general equilibrium model with risk-averse agents and segmented financial markets, where tariff volatility enters uncovered interest parity through a risk-premium wedge. Higher tariff uncertainty increases precautionary savings and risk premia, leading to immediate currency depreciation even as tariffs rise. Quantitatively, the model replicates the size and timing of the observed dollar depreciation episode dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose rational disagreement as a formal framework for analyzing seemingly irrational behavior that can persist despite the wide availability of objective information in a steady-state. Agents are rational in that they correctly anticipate the distribution of aggregate outcomes, yet disagree about which specific individuals perform better than others. Notably, the subjective belief of any individual may be objectively correct.
We illustrate the key concepts with a simple entry game. We show how unordered individual outcome distributions can be identified solely from aggregate statistics. We then characterize the resulting game, define its Nash equilibria, and develop a statistical test for the null hypothesis of agreement. Finally, we situate our framework within the broader literature on Bayesian games, behavioral biases, and the rational expectations hypothesis.</content>

    <title>The Contribution of College Majors to Gender and Racial Earnings Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender and racial/ethnic gaps in labor market earnings remain large, even among college-goers. Cross-gender and race/ethnic differences in choice of and returns to college major are potentially important contributors. Following Texas public high school graduates for up to 20 years through college and the labor market, we assess gender and racial differences in college major choices and the consequences of these choices. Women and underrepresented minorities are less likely than men, Whites, and Asians to major in high earning fields like business, economics, engineering, and computer science, however we also show that they experience lower returns to these majors. Differences in major-specific returns relative to liberal arts explain about one quarter of the gender, White-Black, and White-Hispanic (but not White-Asian) earnings gaps among four-year college students and become larger contributors to earnings gaps than differential major distributions as workers age. We present suggestive evidence that differences in occupation choices within field are a key driver of the differences in returns across groups. The work shines light on the roles that college major choice and returns by gender and race contribute to inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter presents a tractable framework for the study of technology adoption and diffusion in the context of economic development. Firms in countries behind the world technology frontier can rapidly adopt new techniques from the world frontier. Lower absorptive capacity (because of weak education systems, poor management practices, or barriers to technology adoption), institutional distortions, mismatch between frontier technologies and the needs of firms in the country (i.e., “inappropriate technology”), and credit market frictions slow down technology adoption and cause the economy in question to have a greater distance to the frontier and thus lower income per capita—although the long-run growth rate of the country still remains equal to that of the frontier. This framework is extended to study the choice between innovation and imitation, as well as the role of selection for higher-productivity and higher-absorptive capacity firms during the process of economic development. We illustrate the main comparative statics of our framework with a number of correlations based on cross-country and firm-level data. The tractability of the framework makes it amenable to a range of additional extensions.</content>

    <title>Senior Migration, Local Economic Development and Spatial Concentration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that migration flows upon retirement are predominantly from richer, more urban to poorer, more rural regions. In theory, the local economic implications of senior in-migration are ambiguous, while empirically there is little existing evidence on whether attracting mobile seniors can be an effective tool to promote economic development among lagging regions. We combine a unique collection of microdata from France with a new empirical strategy to fill this gap. We find that senior inflows have significant positive effects on the local economy over the course of a decade, including increases in the working-age population, total employment, GDP, average incomes, fiscal revenues and housing construction. These effects are particularly pronounced among initially poorer regions. They are accompanied by an increase in the share of services in the local economy, driven by employment growth in health, food services and retail sectors. Combining these estimates with observed region-to-region net migration flows, we find that mobile seniors have become a significant force for reducing the concentration of employment and GDP across regions.</content>

    <title>Missing Black Men? The Impact of Non-Reporting on Estimates of Labor Market Outcomes for Black Men</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adult Black men persistently do not report to household-based surveys, with demographers estimating non-reporting rates of 7-14% from 1970-2020. We derive a method to account for incomplete data and show that non-reporting rates are up to 5.5 percentage points (pp) larger than prior estimates, with significant heterogeneity by year. We then show that Black men at risk of incarceration drive non-reporting. We use state-year variation in incarceration rates to estimate that 35-83% of the incarcerated population would have been non-reporting if not incarcerated. Adjusting for previously uncorrected non-reporting shows that the Black-white gap in high-school completion is 20-39% (3.0-5.9 pp) larger, college attendance is 8-18% (3.1-6.1 pp) larger, and earnings is 10-20% (2.8-5.7 pp) larger. In contrast, the gap in  employment is 4-8% (0.6-1.6 pp) smaller than previously thought.</content>

    <title>Speculative Growth and the AI "Bubble"</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;AI technology can generate speculative-growth equilibria. These are rational but fragile: elevated valuations support rapid capital accumulation, yet persist only as long as beliefs remain coordinated. Because AI capital is labor-like, it expands effective labor and dampens the normal decline in the marginal product of capital as the capital stock grows. The gains from this expansion accrue disproportionately to capitalists, whose saving rate rises with wealth, raising aggregate saving.  Building on Caballero et al (2006), I show that these features generate a funding feedback—rising capitalist wealth lowers the required return—that can produce multiple equilibria. With intermediate adjustment costs, elevated valuations are the mechanism that sustains a transition toward a high-capital equilibrium; a loss of confidence can precipitate a self-fulfilling crash and reversal.</content>

    <title>Modeling the Labor Implications of the Energy Transition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The energy transition away from fossil fuels toward alternative energy sources will, like every significant economic transition, disrupt existing economic relationships and markets. Disruption in the labor market is of particular concern due to the distributional and political importance of energy jobs and the potential concentration of risks on workers in carbon-intensive sectors and regions that are particularly reliant on fossil-fuel industries. We look at modeling the labor implications of the energy transition. We outline a conceptual framework for analyzing the labor-market risks, focusing on obstacles to labor-market adjustments during the transition. We then review empirical research on such barriers to labor-market adjustments, with a focus on evidence that can inform modeling efforts. We also survey the literature on ex-ante modeling of the effects of the energy transition on labor markets, identifying both the challenges and opportunities for new research in this field.</content>

    <title>Financial Crises: History, Theory and New Insights</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review essay discusses the history, causes and consequences of financial crises. In recent years scholars have assembled new sources of data and utilized new empirical designs to analyze crises, shedding light on old questions and producing new insights. This essay highlights those new insights, and uses the historical record of crises in the United States to put those insights into perspective. I begin with a discussion of the defining characteristics of financial crises and their evolution, both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. I then revisit the chronology of crises in the U.S. since 1870. Data on bank failure rates and large-bank equity losses suggest that some panics were not full-blown financial crises, and also identify episodes when no panic occurred that could potentially be considered crises. I then turn to two categories of theoretical models developed to analyze the mechanisms responsible for crises. The first focuses on asset price bubbles, which have been associated with many crises. The second is focused on the dynamics of bank runs and panics, which have been especially common in the United States. Finally, I present an overview of the effects of crises and the mechanisms transmitting financial distress in the banking system into the rest of the economy.</content>

    <title>Structural Change and Jobless Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Benchmark models of structural transformation focus on the reallocation of employment across sectors while assuming that overall employment stays constant. We show that this assumption does not match facts for developing economies. We study a panel of 48 mostly developing economies over the period 1990--2018 and document a strong positive relationship between the share of the population employed in agriculture and the overall employment rate. That is, the early part of the development process is associated with a substantial decline in the total employment rate. Motivated by this finding, we extend a benchmark model of structural change featuring Stone-Geary preferences to allow for endogenous labor supply. We show that this model can account for the patterns we document in the data both qualitatively and quantitatively. We use a calibrated version of our model to study the employment dynamics in several developing economies and show that structural change is a quantitatively important source of employment changes during the early stages of development.</content>

    <title>Current Account Deficits and the Welfare of Future Generations</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the effects of one nation's  taxation of consumption on the welfare of future generations of other countries. To do this, it presents an otherwise standard one-good, two-country optimal growth model with free capital markets, but where each date represents the lifetime of a generation which cares not only about its own consumption and leisure, but also that of its descendants.
Relative to a no tax benchmark, a policy of one country taxing consumption of its initial generations has ambiguous welfare effects for future generations of the other country, as long as those future generations are not too far in the future.   Higher initial savings in the first country raises capital levels, and thus wages, in both countries, raising welfare of future generations in the second country, but also induces lower bequests in the second country, lowering the welfare of its future generations.  In the long run, or for generations born near the steady state, the welfare effects of the first country inducing lower consumption of its initial generations are unambiguous: future generations of the second country are made worse off.  Households born in the second country will regret that their ancestors allowed such policy-induced intertemporal trade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite substantial convergence in men’s and women’s economic roles, gender gaps in labor market outcomes persist across countries. This article provides a unified framework for understanding how gender norms shape economic behavior, distinguishing between internalized norms—preferences and beliefs tied to gender identity—and external norms arising from peer pressure and social coordination. We first document cross-country and within-country variation in gender attitudes, alongside gradual but uneven shifts toward more egalitarian views. We then review empirical evidence on the origins, persistence, and transmission of gender norms, and their effects on human capital accumulation, labor supply, wages, and policy take-up. The review highlights both the durability of gender norms and the mechanisms through which policies, institutions, and media can induce norm change, with implications for the design of effective interventions.</content>

    <title>You Only Live Twice: Financial Inflows and Growth in a Westward-Facing Ukraine</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The monumental task of rebuilding postwar Ukraine requires early planning and identification of growth strategies. The earlier accession of Eastern European countries to the European Union and NATO offers a template that relies on massive foreign direct investment and public structural funds. This approach helps to raise incomes directly and can create a virtuous circle where capital deepening facilitates technological upgrades and repatriation of war refugees, which in turn stimulate more investment. We show theoretically that the government can refine this strategy by internalizing positive externalities from having a higher capital stock: Investment in physical capital relaxes borrowing constraints (thus allowing more capital inflows) and raises wages (thus encouraging more Ukrainian refugees to return home).</content>
