    <title>Portfolio Choice and Settlement Frictions: A Theory of Endogenous Convenience Yields</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study settlement frictions that arise from the need to finance negative balances through an over-the-counter (OTC) market. We derive a closed-form expression for the endogenous convenience yield and show how it can be incorporated into a canonical portfolio problem. Using this framework, we examine how shifts in settlement frictions affect liquidity premia, the volume of overnight funding, the dispersion of market rates, and optimal portfolio allocations. From a normative perspective, we show that in the competitive equilibrium, investors may either over- or under-invest in liquid assets; moreover, both higher risk aversion and tighter aggregate liquidity increase the likelihood of under-accumulation.</content>

    <title>A Note on Factors Influencing Trust in Government</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Responses to surveys eliciting evaluations of trust in government, both generally and in specific areas, have varied over time and across countries. Using consistent survey data for 34 OECD countries from 2007-2023, we estimate a model of factors determining levels of trust. We employ a series of econometric techniques of increasing sophistication. The level and growth rate of real income per capita, social spending per capita, the degree of decentralization, and economic freedom all exert positive effects on trust. Inflation, unemployment, and debt per capita negatively affect trust. Additionally, higher levels of human capital and the elderly share of the population negatively affect trust. In the context of trust in government, the estimates suggest a heavier weight on inflation than on unemployment when compared to Okun’s misery index, which weights them equally. Additionally, the estimates are used to evaluate combinations of policies, e.g. debt-financed increases in social spending that affect inflation and/or unemployment, to determine the net effect on trust in government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Continuation funds (CFs) are private equity structures in which a manager raises a new fund to purchase assets from their existing fund. This structure has surged in popularity, from five funds in 2018 to 130 in 2024. We use a hand-collected sample of 472 CFs to test a model in which heterogeneous preferences drive CFs. Consistent with the model’s predictions, CFs emerge when LPs are more heterogeneous and managers have earned carried interest that they can roll. LPs typically choose to exit rather than invest, with this decision driven by both LP-level frictions and time varying LP liquidity demands.</content>

    <title>Rating Government Procurement Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel, scalable method for assessing the quality of public procurement systems using standard administrative data. Our approach compares the distribution of procurement opportunities to the distribution of contract awards across firms. We first derive a simple theoretical benchmark that relates the expected distribution of contract value winning firms, measured as a Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), to the distribution of auction values, measured as a respective HHI, and the number of winning firms. Significant deviations of winning firms’ HHI from this benchmark indicate potential governance failures such as corruption or unchecked collusion. Our method requires no subjective input, is transparent and reproducible, and allows for meaningful comparisons across countries, industry sectors, and over time. We use procurement data from Ukraine and EU member states in 2018–2021 to assess the performance of five large sectors. Results indicate that Ukraine’s procurement performance in four of the five sectors is comparable to many other European countries. However, Ukraine’s construction sector consistently displays the largest excess concentration among all countries considered, consistent with anecdotal evidence of corruption in this sector. Overall, with minimal data requirements, our method offers a practical tool for cross-sector and cross-country assessment of procurement systems.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Pay Transparency in Job Postings on the Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the labor market effects of recent state-level policies that require employers to disclose salary information in job postings. Leveraging a difference-in-differences design, we show that employers increased the fraction of postings with salary information by 30 percentage points. Across three datasets, we find consistent evidence of an increase in wages of 1.3-3.6%. We find no impacts on pay dispersion, employment, the number of postings, or skill and education requirements. Our evidence is consistent with pay transparency increasing competition in the labor market, leading to positive spillovers on incumbent workers and always-posting firms.</content>

    <title>Disentangling Sources of Variation in C-Section Rates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cesarean section rates vary widely across U.S. counties, yet it remains unclear how much of this variation reflects demand-side factors (such as patient risk or preferences) versus supply-side factors (such as physician practices or hospital incentives). We develop a new empirical strategy to isolate the influence of supply-side forces. Exploiting hospital obstetric unit closures from 1989–2019 that reallocate some mothers to counties with different C-section rates, we find that a one–percentage-point increase in the delivery county’s rate raises a mother’s likelihood of a C-section by roughly one point. The results point to a dominant role for provider behavior and local practice norms in driving geographic variation in C-section use, the most common major surgery in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document some underappreciated aspects of the recent evolution of the international reserve system. These include the growing share of gold in global central bank reserves, the continuing emergence of nontraditional reserve currencies, and the stalling share of renminbi in reserves. These trends are consistent with our findings in our earlier papers. In addition we look to the future, pondering the potential implications of dollar-linked stablecoins, the expansion of the BRICS grouping of countries and their de- dollarization plans, the development of blockchain-based platforms such as Project mBridge for the direct exchange of central bank digital currencies, and questions about the dollar’s safe-haven status.</content>

    <title>Middlemen in Search Equilibrium: A Survey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This essay surveys the literature on middlemen—i.e., intermediation in exchange—reviewing, extending and consolidating key developments in the field. This is important because intermediated trade is common in reality but absent in standard general equilibrium theory. We focus on research using search theory. In various models, agents may act as middlemen when they are good at search, bargaining, recognizing quality, storing inventories, using credit, etc. The theory applies to markets for goods, inputs or assets. We discuss versions with indivisible or divisible goods, fixed or endogenous participation, stationary and dynamic equilibria, and some implications for efficiency and volatility.</content>

    <title>Leniency Designs: An Operator’s Manual</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a step-by-step guide to leniency (a.k.a. judge or examiner instrument) designs, drawing on recent econometric literatures. The unbiased jackknife instrumental variables estimator (UJIVE) is purpose-built for leveraging exogenous leniency variation, avoiding subtle biases even in the presence of many decision-makers or controls. We show how UJIVE can also be used to assess key assumptions underlying leniency designs, including quasi-random assignment and average first-stage monotonicity, and to probe the external validity of treatment effect estimates. We further discuss statistical inference, arguing that non-clustered standard errors are often appropriate. A reanalysis of Farre-Mensa et al. (2020), using quasi-random examiner assignment to estimate the value of patents to startups, illustrates our checklist.</content>

    <title>The Race Between Asset Supply and Asset Demand</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce an asset supply-and-demand approach to analyze the trajectory of US aggregate wealth, real interest rates, and fiscal sustainability. Our framework uses micro-founded and easy-to-implement sufficient statistics to quantify how shifts in demographics, inequality, and other forces affect asset market equilibrium. From 1950 to the present, rapid population aging, rising income inequality, increasing foreign demand for US assets, and declining productivity growth all contributed to a surge in asset demand. Asset supply initially fell, then turned around sharply, mainly driven by increases in government debt and the value of capitalized profits. Overall, asset demand won the race, and interest rates fell. Looking ahead to 2100, population aging will continue to strongly push up asset demand, but at current tax and benefit levels, asset supply will win the race, as rising entitlement costs push up government debt even more. While rising asset demand creates space for debt to eventually reach 250% of GDP without higher interest rates, stabilizing debt at any level requires a permanent fiscal adjustment of at least 10% of GDP.</content>

    <title>Internal vs. External Shocks in Weakening Democracies: Evidence on Migration and Foreign Investment</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the consequences of regime change for both migration and foreign direct investment (FDI) by employing quasi-natural experiments that exploit external and internal shocks to democratic institutions. It compares evidence from Europe, which was afflicted by the “Syrian Shock”—an external institutional stress testing administrative and fiscal capacity—and Israel, which experienced the “Corruption Shock”—an internal credibility crisis that eroded judicial independence and policy predictability. These two shocks provide a natural experiment to examine how weakening democratic institutions influence both capital mobility and people mobility, using a unified econometric framework.
The analysis applies Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation to OECD panel data spanning 1995–2023 to isolate the causal effects of institutional deterioration on FDI inflows and migration flows. The DiD approach, complemented by fixed effects at the country and year levels, captures both the short-term disruptions caused by exogenous humanitarian pressures and the long-term persistence of governance-driven uncertainty. The results demonstrate that internal shocks—such as Israel’s judicial and corruption crises—generate large and durable declines in FDI and sustained outward migration, while external shocks—such as Europe’s refugee crisis—produce more transient effect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a large-scale randomized evaluation of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program in 531 Peruvian rural primary schools. We use administrative data on academic performance and grade progression over 10 years to estimate the long-run effects of increased computer access on (i) school performance over time and (ii) students’ educational trajectories. Following schools over time, we find no significant effects on academic performance but some evidence of negative effects on grade progression. Following students over time, we find no significant effects on primary and secondary completion, academic performance in secondary school, or university enrollment. Survey data indicate that computer access significantly improved students’ computer skills but not their cognitive skills; treated teachers received some training but did not improve their digital skills and showed limited use of technology in classrooms, suggesting the need for additional pedagogical support.</content>

    <title>Dilution vs. Risk Taking: Capital Gains Taxes and Entrepreneurship</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent proposals to tax unrealized capital gains or wealth have sparked a debate about their impact on entrepreneurship. We show that accrual-based taxation creates two opposing effects: successful founders face greater dilution from advance tax payments, whereas unsuccessful founders receive tax credits that effectively provide insurance. Using comprehensive new data on U.S. venture capital deals, we find that founder returns remain extremely skewed, with 84% receiving zero exit value while the top 2% capture 80% of total value. Moving from current realization-based to accrual-based taxation would reduce founder ownership at exit by 25% on average but would also increase the fraction receiving positive payoffs from 16% to 47% when tax credits are refunded. Embedding these distributions in a dynamic career choice model, we find that founders with no or moderate risk aversion prefer the current realization-based tax system, while more risk-averse founders prefer accrual-based taxation. We estimate that a 2% annual wealth tax has a similar impact on dilution as taxing unrealized capital gains but produces no risk-sharing benefits due to the absence of tax credits in case of down rounds.</content>

    <title>Unraveling the Drivers of Energy-saving Technical Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the increasing divergence between economic growth and energy consumption through energy-saving technical progress. Proposing a new measure of energy-saving technology, we study the underlying drivers in a semi-structural model of the U.S. economy.  Our analysis shows that energy price shocks reduce consumption and stimulate energy-saving innovation, but also cause economic downturns and crowd out other innovations. Only energy-saving technology shocks can explain the negative co-movement between output and energy use. These sudden efficiency gains emerge as the primary driver of energy-saving technical change. Our findings highlight the importance of fostering energy-saving innovations in transitioning to a low-carbon economy.</content>

    <title>Shutting Down Japantown: The Effects of WWII Internment on Japanese American Enclaves</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During World War II, the U.S. government incarcerated all West Coast Japanese Americans in internment camps. We ask how this forced displacement affected Japanese American enclaves. Using the recently digitized 1940 and 1950 full-count censuses, we measure changes in the racial composition of neighborhoods across 14 major cities. We find that internment reduced the Japanese American population of enumeration districts within the exclusion zone by 25–50% relative to their 1940 levels, and that these individuals were replaced by African American in-movers in a nearly 1-to-1 fashion. Outside the exclusion zone, new Japanese American enclaves formed, but did not approach the scale of their historic West Coast counterparts.</content>

    <title>Target Allocation Funds, Strategic Complementarities, and Market Fragility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Target allocation funds (TAFs) make predictable rebalancing trades to maintain portfolio weights across asset classes. During the COVID-19 stock market crash, TAFs sold $59 billion of bond fund shares and simultaneously purchased a similar amount of equity fund shares. We show that TAF rebalancing triggers strategic complementarity: bond mutual funds facing larger rebalancing-induced sales by TAFs experienced greater outflows from other non-TAF investors. This effect was particularly pronounced for illiquid bond funds and amplified total bond fund outflows during COVID-19 by an additional $27 billion. Rebalancing by TAFs, together with the strategic amplification by other investors, transmits equity market shocks to bond returns, accounting for 17% of the rise in stock-bond correlation over the past decade.</content>

    <title>The Local-Area Incidence of Exporting</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a new algorithm to map confidential firm-level export transactions to their underlying establishments that can be implemented on U.S. microdata. Using this procedure, we construct a novel micro-dataset of U.S. exports at the plant level. Aggregation of these data permits more accurate measurement of exporting at the subnational level (e.g., county, MSA, etc.) than was previously possible. The data reveal exports to be much more geographically concentrated than both employment and manufacturing sales, implying that some regions are heavily reliant on foreign demand. To illustrate the consequences of such exposure, we study the effects of the trade collapse during the Great Recession on local labor markets. Counties experiencing greater declines in foreign demand performed worse in terms of employment, pay, and wages during the Great Recession. A similar analysis implemented with publicly available imputed export data—a common practice in the literature—fails to replicate these estimates.</content>

    <title>Linear Regressions with Combined Data</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study linear regressions in a context where the outcome of interest and some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets that cannot be matched. Traditional approaches obtain point identification by relying, often implicitly, on exclusion restrictions. We show that without such restrictions, coefficients of interest can still be partially identified, with the sharp bounds taking a simple form. We obtain tighter bounds when variables observed in both datasets, but not included in the regression of interest, are available, even if these variables are not subject to specific restrictions. We develop computationally simple and asymptotically normal estimators of the bounds. Finally, we apply our methodology to estimate racial disparities in patent approval rates and to evaluate the effect of patience and risk-taking on educational performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate and compare impacts of cash and in-kind transfers on the consumption of temptation goods in the same population, and explore normative implications. We use two decades of data from South Carolina on cash benefits from Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and in-kind benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) linked to detailed data on adults’ health care use. Our empirical strategy examines outcome changes in the several days following each transfer’s scheduled monthly payout. Emergency department visits for drug and alcohol use increase by 20-30 percent following SSI receipt, but do not respond to SNAP receipt. Fills of prescription drugs for new illnesses also increase following SSI receipt but do not respond to SNAP receipt. Motivated by these non-fungibility results, we develop a model of a paternalistic social planner choosing the mix of cash and SNAP for a fixed-budget transfer program when consumers have self-control problems and may engage in mental accounting. We show that the planner’s optimal SNAP share is strictly positive and weakly increasing as self-control worsens. Moreover, with heterogeneity in self-control and mental accounting, the planner may choose to use SNAP even when they have access to a uniform Pigouvian tax on the temptation good.</content>

    <title>The Spatial Distribution of Income in Cities: New Global Evidence and Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the spatial distribution of income and commuting patterns within cities vary across the development spectrum, drawing on new granular data from 50,000 neighborhoods in 121 cities across developed and developing countries. We document that in developing countries, poorer urban households are significantly more likely to live far from city centers, in hilly terrain, and near rivers. These patterns are absent or reversed in developed cities. Commuting shares decline more sharply with distance in less developed countries, indicating higher commuting costs that exacerbate spatial inequality in job access. Job-access measures are considerably worse for the urban poor than for the urban rich in developing countries, while the opposite is true in developed countries. We interpret these findings in a quantitative urban model and show that a parsimonious set of factors—nonhomothetic preferences over amenities, commuting costs, and the spatial concentration of jobs—helps explain most of the cross-country patterns we document.</content>

    <title>Misaligned by Design: Incentive Failures in Machine Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The cost of error in many high-stakes settings is asymmetric: misdiagnosing pneumonia when absent is an inconvenience, but failing to detect it when present can be life-threatening. Accordingly, artificial intelligence (AI) models used to assist such decisions are frequently trained with asymmetric loss functions that incorporate human decision-makers' trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. In two focal applications, we show that this standard alignment practice can backfire. In both cases, it would be better to train the machine learning model with a loss function that ignores the human’s objective and then adjust predictions ex post according to that objective. We rationalize this result using an economic model of incentive design with endogenous information acquisition. The key insight from our theoretical framework is that machine classifiers perform not one but two incentivized tasks: choosing how to classify and learning how to classify. We show that while the adjustments engineers use correctly incentivize choosing, they can simultaneously reduce the incentives to learn. Our formal treatment of the problem reveals that methods embraced for their intuitive appeal can in fact misalign human and machine objectives in predictable ways.</content>

    <title>The Global Value of Cities</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the economic value of cities worldwide, using detailed job histories for 513 million workers in 220,000 cities across 191 countries. These estimates allow us to identify why some cities are more productive than others and to quantify the earnings gains from migration throughout the development process. Our data contain job spells—with start and end dates, establishment names, locations, job titles, and effective salaries—enabling an event-study movers design with individual and time fixed effects. Moving to higher-value cities leads to immediate increases in job seniority, shifts into better-paid industries and occupations, and large overall earnings gains. The global scope of the data lets us compare internal and international moves and assess how the productivity advantages of cities differ by country income level. Across borders, 93% of wage changes reflect city effects, while within countries this share ranges from 45–73%. High-income countries exhibit stronger ability-based sorting, reducing the proportion attributable to place. City effects rise with industrial diversity and population, consistent with agglomeration economies, and more productive cities allocate workers to higher-productivity firms. The wide dispersion of city effects within countries highlights substantial potential gains from migration, particularly in low-income, less-urbanized economies. Reallocating workers to match the US distribution yields sizable wage gains in developing countries.</content>

    <title>Playing Catch-up with Health Savings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use comprehensive tax data to study how saving behavior responds to the Health Savings Account (HSA) “catch-up” contribution provision, which raises HSA contribution limits for individuals aged 55 and older. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find a sharp increase in contributions among those previously near the limit and smaller increases among unconstrained savers. Induced contributions are not immediately withdrawn and do not appear to crowd out retirement savings. Responses are strongest among payroll contributors and long-term savers. However, married couples do not appear to coordinate their HSA behavior to take advantage of the complex spousal rules governing catch-up contributions. Our findings highlight how tax incentives shape HSA saving and suggest that tax-advantaged account design meaningfully affects household financial behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use high-frequency retail microdata to measure the short-run impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs on consumer prices. By matching daily prices from major U.S. retailers to product-level tariff rates and countries of origin, we construct price indices that isolate the direct effects of tariff changes across goods and trading partners. Prices began rising immediately after the broader tariff measures announced in early March and continued to increase gradually over subsequent months, with imported goods rising roughly twice as much as domestic ones. Our estimated retail tariff pass-through is 20 percent, with a cumulative contribution of about 0.7 percentage points to the all-items Consumer Price Index by September 2025. Our results show that tariff costs were gradually but steadily transmitted to U.S. consumers, with additional spillovers to domestic goods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct representative security-fund-level longitudinal data for the United States using regulatory filings of portfolio holdings from Form N-PORT. We validate our dataset by comparing coverage and composition to official statistics from the Federal Reserve’s Financial Accounts of the United States (formerly known as the Flow of Funds) and Treasury International Capital (TIC) System, and to micro-level commercial datasets. We showcase an application by replicating and updating Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2020) findings on home currency bias using N-PORT instead of commercial fund holdings data. Our results confirm that N-PORT data offer a comprehensive, reliable, and public source for research in macroeconomics and finance. We make all the security-level data on holdings available in a public repository of the GCAP Lab and provide code for updating the data.</content>

    <title>The Logic of State Surveillance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;All states adopt systems to surveil political activists. How do they decide whom to watch and why? We study the logic of state surveillance using the first complete individual-level database of those monitored by a state — 152,000 Italians born between 1816 and 1932, encompassing both democratic and authoritarian regimes. We focus on education: exploiting a discontinuous expansion in primary schooling in municipalities above a population and age threshold, we show that cohorts exposed to more years of school experienced an uptick in surveillance. The effect is largest for working classes, who were monitored for longer periods, subjected to harsher measures, and disproportionately targeted when affiliated with communist ideologies. Yet treated cohorts did not become more politically active, indicating that surveillance expanded not in reaction to increased mobilization, but as a preventive strategy rooted in fears of working-class empowerment. These findings reveal how states view educated yet excluded groups as politically threatening and prioritize their surveillance, potentially generating inequalities in groups' ability to influence political change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We causally test alternative theories of expectation formation. Using a randomized information experiment we show overreaction is a key feature of individuals' return expectations, and individuals' response to the price-earnings ratio is opposite to the academic consensus. Our evidence is inconsistent with standard models of expectation formation but subjective mental models that deviate from objective benchmarks can jointly explain the updating behavior in the experiment, the link between individuals' prior perceptions and expectations, and the heterogeneity of updating. Conditional on their beliefs, individuals' sensitivity of equity shares in a hypothetical portfolio choice experiment is consistent with the standard Merton model.</content>

    <title>Malleable Minds: The Effects of STEM- vs. Humanities-Focused Curricula</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impacts of assignment to STEM vs. humanities-focused curricula in Romania’s high school system. We apply a regression discontinuity design to administrative and survey data to estimate effects on educational pathways, desired careers, and non-cognitive outcomes. An overarching theme of our findings is the malleability of students to what they study. Assignment to STEM increases STEM college enrollment and technology or engineering career intentions by 25 pp. Exploring mechanisms, we find that STEM assignment changes students’ self-perceived academic abilities and their preferences over academic subjects and job tasks. STEM assignment is risky for low-achieving students, reducing their chances of passing a high school exit exam and enrolling in college. A final finding is that STEM makes boys more conservative, while shifting some of girls' views to the left. Our results identify a strategy for promoting STEM higher education and careers, but also highlight potential tradeoffs.</content>

    <title>The Social Rate of Return on Road Infrastructure Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A billion people live more than two kilometers from an all-season road, the vast majority of whom reside in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), where the absence of paved roads hinders growth and development. Consistent with this shortage, we estimate that the median social rate of return to installing an additional kilometer of two-lane highway in EMDEs is 55 percent—roughly eight times the social rate of return on private capital in the US. The size and precision of the estimates vary widely across countries. But the eightfold excess social return on roads is, nevertheless, five times larger than the excess financial return on stocks in developing countries that once catalyzed the creation of emerging market equity as an asset class. The absolute and relative magnitudes of these excess returns thus suggest the possibility of substantial unrealized gains from reallocating developed-country savings toward public capital formation in EMDEs. We document these facts using a production function approach to estimate each country’s marginal product of public capital (MPX). We then pair these estimates with country-specific, hedonic road-construction prices (Px) from the Roads Cost Knowledge System to compute social rates of return (Rx). Because macro estimates face well-known identification and measurement challenges, we interpret our findings alongside complementary evidence on financial and micro-level returns.</content>

    <title>An Anatomy of the Great Reallocation in US Supply Chain Trade</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents stylized facts about the "Great Reallocation" in US supply chain trade following the 2018–2019 tariff shocks and the April 2025 Liberation Day announcements. We find that: (i) The US has decoupled from China but not from the world overall. (ii) US imports diversified mainly among its top-20 partners, rather than expanding to new source countries. (iii) Local linear projections confirm ongoing declines in China's import shares, with compensating increases from Vietnam, Mexico, and Taiwan. (iv) Most of this shift occurred along the product-level intensive margin, though extensive margin adjustments became more pronounced for Vietnam and India from 2021-2024. (v) After a period of "wait and see", the decline in import shares from China spread to contract-intensive and relationship-sticky goods by 2021-2024. (vi) Early 2025 data suggest that trade reallocation has already accelerated after Liberation Day, in favor of trade partners facing lower additional tariffs and with geographically proximate supply networks. Together, these findings show that the US-China tariff shocks have unwound the US' sourcing from China back to where it stood at the time of China's WTO accession.</content>

    <title>The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications: Comment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;De Loecker et al. (2020)  (DEU) estimate that markups increased significantly in the United States from 1955 to 2016. We find this result is sensitive to unreported sample restrictions that drop 27% of the available observations. Applying the methodology as described in the article to the full sample, markup increases are more muted until late in the sample period, and are almost entirely driven by Finance and Insurance firms. If these firms are removed, markup increases are modest. We conclude that the DEU methodology and data, as they are described in the article, do not support the conclusion that broad-based increases in market power have occurred in recent decades.

This paper was motivated by an earlier NBER working paper.  The authors of that paper have posted a response to this paper. The authors of this paper have prepared a rejoinder to the response.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare the lending technology of direct lenders, banks, and finance companies using a unique data set on secured borrowing by the universe of U.S.-based private middle market firms. The borrowers of direct lenders are distinct relative to those of traditional lenders; they are younger, more likely to be in intangible capital industries, and more likely to be located in the biggest cities in the United States. These differences reflect the focus of direct lenders on private equity-owned firms; direct lenders have negligible impact in industries and cities with low private equity presence. The lending technology of direct lenders is distinct from banks: they have almost no branch network, they are geographically distant from borrowers, they write collateral claims more focused on the continuation value of firms after a default, and they have a higher degree of specialization in certain industries. Direct lenders and private equity sponsors match on industry specialization more strongly than geographic proximity. The findings suggest that direct lenders are not a general substitute for traditional lenders in middle market business lending, but they are instead specialized lenders focused on a particular segment of the U.S. economy with a distinct lending technology.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Forecasts about research findings affect critical scientific decisions, such as what treatments an R&amp;D lab invests in, or which papers a researcher decides to write. But what do we know about the accuracy of these forecasts? We analyze a unique data set of all 100 projects posted on the Social Science Prediction Platform from 2020 to 2024, which received 53,298 forecasts in total, including 66 projects for which we also have results. We show that forecasters, on average, over-estimate treatment effects; however, the average forecast is quite predictive of the actual treatment effect. We also examine differences in accuracy across forecasters. Academics have a slightly higher accuracy than non-academics, but expertise in a field does not increase accuracy. A panel of motivated repeat forecasters has higher accuracy, but this does not extend more broadly to all repeat forecasters. Confidence in the accuracy of one's forecasts is perversely associated with lower accuracy. We also document substantial cross-study correlation in accuracy among forecasters and identify a group of "superforecasters". Finally, we relate our findings to results in the literature as well as to expert forecasts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change is already increasing temperatures and raising the frequency of natural disasters in the United States. In this paper, we examine several major vectors through which climate change affects US households, including cost increases associated with home insurance claims and increased cooling, as well as sources of increased mortality. Although we consider only a subset of climate costs over recent decades, we find an aggregate annual cost averaging between $400 and $900 per household; in 10 percent of counties, costs exceed $1,300 per household. Costs vary significantly by geography, with the largest costs occurring in some western regions of the United States, the Gulf Coast, and Florida. Climate costs also typically disproportionately burden lower-income households. Our work suggests the importance of research that looks beyond rising temperatures to extreme weather events; so far, natural disasters account for the bulk of the burden of climate change in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using transaction-level data on US congressional stock trades, we find that lawmakers who later ascend to leadership positions perform similarly to matched peers beforehand but outperform them by 47 percentage points annually after ascension. Leaders’ superior performance arises through two mechanisms. The political influence channel is reflected in higher returns when their party controls the chamber, sales of stocks preceding regulatory actions, and purchase of stocks whose firms receiving more government contracts and favorable party support on bills. The corporate access channel is reflected in stock trades that predict subsequent corporate news and greater returns on donor-owned or home-state firms.</content>

    <title>Effects of WIC on Birth Outcomes: Evidence from Newly Digitized Data from the National Archives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the effect of nutrition—delivered during pregnancy via the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)—on infant health. We contribute to the literature by adding new data on WIC rollout from the National Archives, employing novel methods, investigating new mechanisms, and analyzing previously unexplored infant outcomes, including the distribution of birth weight. We find robust evidence that access to WIC in a woman’s county of residence by the start of their second trimester led to a reduction in the probability of an infant being of low birth weight and to a higher average birth weight, with larger in magnitude effects for infants with Black mothers than for those with White mothers. Our results suggest a lower bound for treatment-on-the-treated effects for low birth weight of -0.9 percentage points and for birth weight of around 33 grams for infants with Black mothers, both economically significant. For White mothers, the effects on low birth weight are much smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant.

    <title>Information Acquisition By Mutual Fund Investors: Evidence from Stock Trading Suspensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mutual funds create liquidity for investors by issuing demandable equity shares while holding illiquid securities. We study the implications of this liquidity creation by examining frequent trading suspensions in China, which temporarily eliminate market liquidity in affected stocks. These suspensions cause significant mispricing of mutual funds due to inaccurate valuations of their illiquid holdings. We find that investors actively acquire information about suspended stocks held by mutual funds, driving flows into underpriced funds. This information is subsequently incorporated into stock prices when trading resumes. Our findings suggest that mutual fund liquidity creation stimulates information acquisition about illiquid, information-sensitive assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Suicide rates among older adults have been rising over time in the United States.  At the same time, more individuals have been suffering with chronic pain and illness, which are often underlying risk factors for suicide.  As self-medication with marijuana has become common, we ask whether access to legal marijuana for medical and recreational purposes reduces suicides rates among older individuals.  We find that suicide rates among older age groups decline following the opening of recreational marijuana dispensaries, especially among older Whites, and middle-aged White males and females with low levels of education.</content>

    <title>Unanticipated Effects of Electronic Benefits Transfer on WIC Stores and Redemptions: Evidence from Administrative Data on Vendors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effects of the nationwide transition in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) from paper vouchers to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on store decisions to seek authorization to accept WIC benefits. We combine novel administrative data from “The Integrity Profile” (USDA administrative data on stores participating in WIC and their WIC reimbursements) with new nationwide policy data on WIC EBT implementation. Using a staggered adoption difference-in-differences approach, we find that the transition had heterogeneous and occasionally unanticipated effects across states. The number of WIC authorized independent vendors declined 10% following WIC EBT implementation. We find no significant effect of WIC EBT implementation on WIC redemptions in a subset of ZIP Codes with sufficient vendors for data sharing. Vendors in states that were early adopters of WIC EBT have more negative effects on the probability of WIC authorization, which may be due to learning effects or improvements in technology over time. Past experience with EBT implementation by financial services providers hired by states to help them implement WIC EBT processing (processors) reduces the magnitude of these negative effects of EBT implementation on store participation in WIC.</content>

    <title>A Sufficient Statistics Approach to Optimal Corporate Taxes</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper characterizes the equity–efficiency tradeoff of corporate taxation using a stylized model that draws on the corporate investment and tax incidence literatures. We derive optimal corporate tax formulas in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities and welfare weights on workers and firm owners. While much empirical work emphasizes investment responses, these elasticities do not feature in optimal tax formulas. The elasticity of taxable profits is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency costs of the corporate tax. Higher corporate tax rates are desirable when firm owners have low welfare weights, and less desirable when taxing profits reduces wages. These empirical objects remain central across extensions, including heterogeneous production technologies, tax sheltering, international capital mobility, monopsony, and linear labor income taxes. We survey the empirical literature and find that existing estimates can support a wide range of optimal tax rates. An inverse-optimum analysis provides combinations of welfare weights of workers and firm owners that would rationalize the post-2017 US corporate tax cut as optimal.</content>

    <title>Ambiguity vs. Risk in Investment Decisions: An Illustration from Green Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) or risk provide a greater discouragement to investment? There is general agreement in the financial press that uncertainty discourages investment, with uncertainty here meaning any situation where important future policy variables (such as tariffs or tax rates) are not known. And it seems intuitively plausible that situations of ambiguity are “more uncertain” than those of risk: under risk, although the outcome is not known, its expected value is, whereas under ambiguity we have a distribution of possible expected values. In this paper we show that under quite general circumstances it is the case that ambiguity deters investment more than an equivalent risk. An equivalent risk is one characterized by a compound lottery reflecting the ambiguous situation, but without ambiguity aversion. We show that there will always be investments opportunities that are rejected when characterized by ambiguity but are accepted when characterized by risk with an equivalent compound lottery, and that the converse is not true: there are no investments that would be made under ambiguity that would not be made under equivalent risk. We develop the analysis in the context of the emerging field of green finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the trauma associated with exposure to racial violence affect economic outcomes? We study this question in the context of lynchings of Black citizens in the American South between 1880 and 1940 and provide systematic evidence of long-run economic impacts of that violence for the broader community and the effects’ persistence across generations. First, using data on averted lynchings and matched placebos as counterfactuals, we show that children indirectly exposed to the racial trauma of lynchings (proxied by close proximity to the victim’s household location) exhibit a reduction in occupational income score and likelihood of holding a white collar occupation, in their prime earning years as adults. We also observe intergenerational effects: children of the individuals who were exposed (as children) to lynchings see, as adults observed in 1940, a reduction in their income relative to counterfactual individuals. By documenting long-run and intergenerational economic effects of exposure to lynchings, we add empirical evidence to an interdisciplinary literature that identifies racial trauma as a distinctive and durable form of psychological harm.</content>

    <title>Moving to Fluidity: Regional Growth and Labor Market Churn</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the connection between regional growth trends and labor market dynamics. New data on manufacturing worker flows for U.S. cities 1969-1981 show more new hires and more voluntary quits in growing cities, but more forced layoffs in shrinking cities. Recessions are special in growing cities in that hires and quits drop, whereas in shrinking cities layoffs rise. A quantitative business cycle model with migration and on-the-job search accounts for a large share of variation in growth and worker flows both over time and across space. Growing cities in the South and West had low job creation costs and only gradual in-migration, so tight labor markets encouraged more on-the-job search. In those cities, aggregate job destruction shocks generated recessions with lower labor market churn. In the shrinking cities of the Rust Belt, in contrast, churn was always low and responded little in recessions.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Widespread Online Education on Market Structure and Enrollment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the rapid expansion of Brazil's private online higher-education sector and its effects on market structure and college enrollment. Exploiting regional and field-specific variation in online education penetration, we find that online programs expand access for older students but divert younger students from higher-quality in-person programs. Greater competition lowers tuition prices but also reduces the supply of in-person degrees. Using an equilibrium model of college education, we show that in the absence of online programs, total enrollment would be 14 percent lower, while in-person enrollment would rise by 33 percent. On net, aggregate labor-market value added declines by 1.4 percent. Online education raises value added for older students, who benefit from increased access, but lowers it for younger students, who shift toward lower-return online options. Counterfactual policies that restrict online enrollment to older cohorts could increase value added for younger students without reducing gains for older cohorts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how a monopolist’s use of consumer data for price discrimination affects welfare. To answer this question, we develop a model of market segmentation subject to residual uncertainty. We fully characterize when data usage monotonically increases or decreases welfare or when the effect is non-monotone. The characterization reduces the problem to one with only two demand curves, and gives a condition for the two-demand-curves case that highlights that information affects welfare in three distinct ways. In the non-monotone case, we provide tight bounds on the welfare effects of information and identify the best local direction for providing additional information.</content>

    <title>Labor Market Strength and Declining Community College Enrollment</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Declining U.S. college enrollments over the past 15 years have triggered questions about the health of the postsecondary sector. Using institution-level data, we make four points. First, such declines are driven not by the four-year sector but by two-year community colleges, which have apparently shrunk by over 30% since the peak of the Great Recession. Second, over one-third of this apparent decline is an artifact of some community colleges being reclassified as offering four-year degrees. Third, pre-Great Recession data shows a 1 percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate increases first-time community college enrollment by 2 percent, suggesting many students are on the margin between community college and job opportunities. For-profit college enrollments are similarly countercyclical, while public and private four-year college enrollments appear acyclical. Our estimates suggest that strengthening labor markets explain about 60% of the post-Great Recession decline in first-time community college enrollment. Fourth, students whose enrollment decisions are most sensitive to labor market conditions appear unlikely to have completed a degree. Though declining community college enrollments are a challenge for postsecondary institutions, it is less clear whether they signal a problem for students on the margin of enrollment.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Guaranteed Basic Income on Crime Perpetration and Victimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first experimental evidence on the impact of providing a guaranteed basic income on criminal perpetration and victimization. We analyze a nationwide randomized controlled trial that provided 2,000 unemployed individuals in Finland with an unconditional monthly payment of 560 Euros for two years (2017-2018), while 173,222 comparable individuals remained under the existing social safety net. Using comprehensive administrative data on police reports and district court trials, we estimate precise zero effects on criminal perpetration and victimization. Point estimates are small and statistically insignificant across all crime categories. Our confidence intervals rule out reductions in perpetration of 5 percent or more for crime reports and 10 percent or more for criminal charges.</content>

    <title>Africa as a Success Story: Political Organization in Pre-Colonial Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an overview of the explanations for the relative lack of state formation historically in Africa. In doing so we systematically document for the first time the extent to which Africa was politically decentralized, calculating that in 1880 there were probably 45,000 independent polities which were rarely organized on ethnic lines. At most 2% of these could be classified as states. We advance a new argument for this extreme political decentralization positing that African societies were deliberately organized to stop centralization emerging. In this they were successful. We point out some key aspects of African societies that helped them to manage this equilibrium. We also emphasize how the organization of the economy was subservient to these political goals.</content>

    <title>Delivering Higher Pay? The Impacts of a Task-Level Pay Standard in the Gig Economy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does a task-level minimum pay requirement for gig workers affect their earnings and employment? We study this question in the context of a January 2024 law in Seattle that establishes a per-task minimum pay standard for app-based delivery workers. Drawing on novel cross-platform, trip-level gig activity data, we compare earnings and employment trajectories around the implementation of the law for workers who were doing delivery work in Seattle before the reform against workers who had been active in other regions of Washington State. We find that the minimum pay law raised delivery pay per task, though the increases in base pay per task were partially offset by a substantial reduction in average tips, a major component of delivery pay. At the same time, the policy led to a reduction in the number of tasks completed by highly attached incumbent drivers (but not an increase in exit from delivery work), completely offsetting increased pay per task and leading to zero effect on monthly earnings. We find evidence that drivers experienced more unpaid idle time and longer distances driven between tasks, but find no evidence that drivers reduced their total time working on delivery apps and only limited evidence of switching from delivery to ride-hailing work. Using a simple model of the labor market for platform delivery drivers, we show that our evidence is consistent with free entry of drivers into the delivery market driving down the task-finding rate until expected earnings return to their pre-reform level. These findings highlight the challenges of raising pay in spot markets for tasks where there is free entry of workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise in nicotine vaping among U.S. teenagers in the late 2010s prompted tobacco control advocates to press for higher electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) taxes to curb their use. This study is the first to explore how the effectiveness of e-cigarette taxation as an anti-vaping policy tool has evolved over time. Using data from several nationally representative data sources and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find that since 2020, the effectiveness of a one dollar increase in ENDS taxes in curbing youth nicotine vaping has declined by over 50 percent. This finding is consistent with the marginal youth vaper becoming more tax inelastic over time. Descriptive evidence shows that the composition of youth ENDS users appears to have shifted toward those with a higher addictive stock and a greater taste for risk, which could make youths less tax responsive. For adults, where nicotine vaping rates are stable or slightly rising and compositional shifts are somewhat less pronounced, we find much less evidence that ENDS tax effectiveness has changed over time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a series of laboratory experiments that implement the Daley and Green (2020) model to examine whether the gradual, exogenous revelation of sellers’ private information influences the occurrence of trades in a bilateral bargaining setting with a static lemon condition. We find that while information does not increase efficiency, it reduces the likelihood that buyers incur losses when trading with low-quality sellers. Anticipating that additional signals will arrive, buyers hesitate to finalize deals immediately and exhibit a “waiting for news” effect, making sizable offer adjustments only when sufficient positive signals have accumulated. In contrast, informed sellers are less sensitive to news but appear to wait for the offer that they deem acceptable.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Paid Sick Leave Mandates on Individuals with Disabilities: Evidence from Social Security Disability Claims</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid sick leave mandates (PSLs), which have been adopted by 18 states and the District of Columbia, require employers to provide regular wages when workers take short-term leave for their own or a family member’s medical needs. This study is the first to explore the effects of PSL adoption on participation in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, as well as the health of persons with disabilities. We find that statewide PSLs are associated with a 6-9 percent increase in initial claims for SSI and joint SSI/SSDI benefits. These applications translate to an increase in beneficiaries, strongest among children under age 18. An exploration of the primary mechanisms likely underlying this result reveals PSL-induced (1) increases in time spent offering informal caregiving of those with disabilities, which may reduce the costs of applying to SS(D)I programs, and (2) increases in health care utilization among children with disabilities. Evidence for negative work hours effects of PSLs is weaker, concentrated among spouses of persons with disabilities. Finally, we find that PSL mandates lead to modest improvements in health among both children and adults with disabilities.</content>

    <title>Medicaid Coverage and Postpartum Opioid Use Disorder Treatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women in the United States has risen more than fourfold since 1999, making substance use a leading cause of maternal mortality. Medicaid finances the majority of births and substance use disorder treatment in the U.S., yet until recently, coverage typically ends 60 days postpartum, potentially disrupting care continuity. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 extends postpartum Medicaid coverage from two months to 12 months, creating a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of coverage on access to medications for OUD (MOUD), the gold-standard treatment. We use linked nationwide all-payer medical and retail pharmacy claims from IQVIA in a difference-in-differences framework comparing postpartum MOUD continuity between Medicaid- and commercially-insured parents with a prenatal history of MOUD use. Extended Medicaid postpartum coverage increases Medicaid-financed MOUD months by 8.55%, the likelihood of continuing MOUD beyond 60 days by 5.12%, and total MOUD supply days by 7.99%. These gains are slightly offset by other payer reductions, yet result in a net 5.10% increase in overall MOUD months and 4.64% rise in treatment adherence. Findings highlight the importance of coverage duration as a practical lever to sustain MOUD treatment in the crucial first year after delivery period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building a cohesive nation-state amid deep ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity is a central challenge for many governments. This paper examines the process of nation building, drawing lessons from the remarkable experience of Indonesia over the past century. I discuss conceptual perspectives on nation building and review Indonesia's historical nation-building trajectory. I then synthesize insights from four studies exploring distinct policy interventions in Indonesia---population resettlement, administrative unit proliferation, land reform, and mass schooling---to understand their effects on social cohesion and national integration. Together, these cases underscore the promise and pitfalls of nation-building efforts in diverse societies, offering guidance for future research and policymaking to support these endeavors in Indonesia and beyond.</content>

    <title>Moral Regulation and Cultural Production: Evidence from Hollywood</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Moral regulation is widespread across societies, yet its consequences have seldom been examined empirically. We study the Hays Code (July 1934–1960s), which imposed systematic moral guidelines on American cinema. Using a regression-discontinuity design, with non-U.S. films providing a comparison group, we find that the moral compliance of U.S. films rose sharply after 1935 and remained high for two decades. The Code also reshaped protagonists and political tone: protagonists became less likely to be women or working class, and political tones grew more conservative. Filmmakers adapted both by increasing compliance within genres and by shifting across them: less-compliant Drama declined while more-compliant Western and Action rose. Companies with a larger market size and immigrant film directors exhibited stronger responses. These findings reveal how moral constraint, market, and identity jointly shape cultural production and how well-intentioned moral regulation can generate broad and often unintended spillovers.</content>

    <title>Financial Returns to Equity Investments in Infrastructure in Emerging-Market and Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the scarcity of infrastructure in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), in the absence of readily accessible data on the historical performance of EMDE infrastructure as an asset class, private investors are reluctant to finance infrastructure projects in these countries. We begin to fill this information gap by computing the financial returns from equity investments in primarily unlisted firms in EMDEs made by the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group. The public market equivalent of 266 equity investments in core infrastructure by the IFC, with starting dates from 1961 to March 2020, was 1.17 using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark, and 1.26 using the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. On average, over the past six decades, equity stakes in emerging-market infrastructure backed by the IFC thus delivered higher returns than investments in portfolios of publicly listed equities. Data from the full sample of IFC equity investments reveal that, on average, a diversified portfolio of investments in infrastructure-related sectors, and indeed, in all sectors more generally, generated significant positive financial returns, albeit with variation across decades.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how differences in financial reporting practices shape firm productivity. Leveraging new audit questions in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), and complementary tax return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and detailed financial records from Sageworks, we find that (i) variation in reporting quality explains 10--20 percent of intra-industry total factor productivity dispersion, and (ii) evidence of complementarity between the effects of financial audits and management practices driving firm productivity. We then examine the underlying mechanisms. First, audits function as a managerial technology, improving the precision of internal information and raising efficiency, with stronger effects in competitive, low-margin industries and among younger firms. Second, exploiting cross-state variation in tax incentives, we show that audits constrain underreporting and mitigate the downward bias in measured productivity. Together, these results highlight the underrated importance of financial reporting quality driving firm productivity.</content>

    <title>Imputation-Powered Inference for Missing Covariates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Missing covariate data is a prevalent problem in empirical research. We provide a novel framework for handling missing covariate data for estimation and inference in downstream tasks. Our general framework provides an automatic and easy-to-use pipeline for empirical researchers: First, missing values are imputed using virtually any imputation method under general observation patterns. Second, we automatically correct for the imputation bias and adaptively weight the imputed values according to their quality. Third, we use all available data, including imputed observations, to obtain more precise point estimates for the downstream task with valid confidence intervals. Our approach ensures valid inference while improving statistical efficiency by leveraging all available data. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under general missing data patterns and a broad class of imputation methods. Through simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over natural benchmarks, as it achieves both lower bias and variance while being robust to imputation quality. In a comprehensive empirical study of the dependence of equity markets on carbon emissions, we show that properly accounting for missing emissions data yields no evidence of correlation between stock returns and emissions directly produced by companies, but a negative correlation with value chain emissions.</content>

    <title>A Model of the Model: Unpacking CGE Results on Carbon Leakage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Computational general equilibrium (CGE) models can evaluate detailed tax reforms, trade restrictions, or environmental policy. These models can capture many complexities, but these complexities can make results difficult to interpret. Analytical general equilibrium (AGE) models provide better intuition and interpretation but cannot capture relevant complexities. We propose a method that employs AGE models to understand CGE models – a “model of the model”. We apply this idea to climate policy and carbon leakage – the increase in emissions elsewhere. Our AGE models identify seven key economic determinants of leakage within any one outcome. We then unpack results from three existing CGE models.</content>

    <title>Tariffs on Medical Goods: Pass-through, Geography, and Aggregate Costs to the US Healthcare System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Have recent tariffs resulted in increased costs for the US healthcare system? We examine US trade data and compile a database of statutory tariff changes. Tariffs on medical goods narrowly defined resulted in $3.4 Billion in duties assessed between February and July 2025—more than 10 times the same period in 2024, with a 55.8 percent rate of pass-through at the US border. We estimate that had medical goods imports observed in 2024 been subject to the statutory tariff levels prevailing in August 2025, assessed duties would have been $15.8 Billion, almost 30 times higher than those observed in real-time. Our aggregates understate imports of medical goods and other imports used in healthcare settings, as data limitations compel us to omit purchases of imported goods for construction, maintenance, and operations of facilities, as well as imports under certain HS10 and HS6 tariff codes that are used when identifying medical goods in many contexts but contain a mixture of imports for medical and non-medical purposes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How has aggregate income and welfare in the United States been affected by globalization and rapid productivity growth in emerging economies? We use the class of constant elasticity trade models to provide quantitative evidence on these questions. We find that reductions in worldwide trade frictions over the period from 1960-2020 reduced the share of the United States in global GDP but raised its aggregate welfare. Similarly, productivity growth in Japan and China led to a decline in the relative income of the United States, but brought aggregate welfare gains from the resulting expansion in global production possibilities. Trade integration and foreign productivity growth have relatively modest effects on domestic income and welfare compared to domestic productivity growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Take-up of means-tested transfer programs in the United States remains incomplete despite their substantial value to eligible households. We contribute to the literature on determinants of program participation by providing the first causal estimates of how proximity to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offices affects program participation. Using administrative data on SNAP receipt in a single state linked to geocoded office locations, we exploit quasi-experimental variation from frequent office openings and closings. Event study estimates show that SNAP participation in a census tract decreases following the closure of an office by 7–9 percent over two years, with suggestive evidence of increases in participation following office openings. These effects are concentrated in urban areas and are robust to alternative specifications and tests of endogeneity in changes in office placement.</content>

    <title>How (Not) to Identify Demand Elasticities in Dynamic Asset Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate approaches to estimating demand elasticities in dynamic asset markets, both theoretically and empirically. We establish strict, necessary conditions that the dynamics of instrumented asset price variation must satisfy for valid identification. We illustrate these insights in a general equilibrium model of dynamic trade and derive the magnitude of biases that arise when these conditions are violated. Estimates based on static IO models are severely biased when the instrumented price variation is persistent or predictable. Empirically, we show that commonly used instruments yield elasticity estimates that are off by orders of magnitude, or even have the wrong sign. In contrast to standard multiplier calculations, our theory characterizes the dynamic asset market interventions required to sustain a given price path support process, with direct implications for policies such as Quantitative Easing (QE).</content>

    <title>California’s Firearm Excise Tax is Almost Fully Passed on to Consumers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effect of California's 11 percent excise tax on firearms, introduced in July 2024, on retail prices. Using price quotes for 48 popular firearms from over 2,200 licensed dealers, we compare California prices to those in other states and to pre-tax trends. We find that prices in California increase by about 10% in response to the 11% tax. Results are consistent across gun types and show no evidence of border spillovers. These findings indicate that firearm excise taxes can effectively raise consumer prices.</content>

    <title>Avoiding Prejudice: Islamophobia and the Labor Supply of Arabs and Muslims in the U.S.</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides direct evidence that members of a disfavored group adjust their economic behavior in response to prejudice. We exploit plausibly exogenous, localized increases in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment generated by combat fatalities of U.S. service members from a given state during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. Linking detailed records on military fatalities with survey data, we estimate the causal effect of these shocks on the labor supply of Arab and Muslim men residing in the affected states. Following a home-state fatality, Arab and Muslim men reduce their weekly hours of work by approximately one percent relative to the baseline sample mean. The reduction is twice as large among the self-employed and concentrated in occupations requiring frequent customer or co-worker interaction. These patterns are consistent with avoidance-based sorting predicted by prejudice-based models of discrimination. The timing of the response coincides with short-lived increases in anti-Muslim hate crimes, confirming that the estimated effects reflect shifts in prejudice rather than broader economic conditions. Our findings provide direct evidence that prejudice can distort market outcomes by inducing targeted individuals to withdraw from interactions with prejudiced market participants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present the first large-scale field experiment test of strategic complementarities in firms’ technology adoption. Our experiment was embedded in a Bank of Italy survey covering around 3,000 firms. We elicited firms’ beliefs about competitors’ adoption of two advanced technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. We randomly provided half of the sample with accurate information about adoption rates. Most firms substantially underestimated competitors’ current adoption, and when provided with information, they updated their expectations about competitors’ future adoption. The information increased firms’ own intended future adoption of robotics, although we do not observe a significant effect on AI adoption. Our findings provide causal evidence on coordination in innovation and illustrate how information frictions shape technology diffusion.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide causal evidence that patient peer effects generate mortality impacts comparable to provider quality differences. Drawing on administrative records covering 2.6 million stays (2000–2010) across 7,200 U.S. nursing homes, we exploit plausibly exogenous roommate assignments identified through unique room identifiers. We estimate that assignment to a roommate diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD), relative to placement in a private room, increases 90-day mortality by 2.1 percentage points (14% of baseline)—equivalent to receiving care at a nursing home one full standard deviation worse in quality. Effects differ sharply by patient type: patients with AD/ADRD benefit substantially from cognitively healthy roommates but not from private rooms, suggesting important peer monitoring and support roles. In contrast, mortality of patients without AD/ADRD does not depend on roommate cognitive health but is reduced in private rooms. A simple assignment rule exploiting this heterogeneity could reduce overall mortality by 0.8 percentage points without additional resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The FDA does not formally regulate representativeness, but if trials under-enroll vulnerable patients, the resulting evidence may understate harm from drugs. We study the relationship between trial participation and the risk of drug-induced adverse events for cancer medications using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program linked to Medicare claims. Initiating treatment with a cancer drug increases the risk of hospitalization due to serious adverse events (SAE) by 2 percentage points per month (a 250% increase). Heterogeneity in SAE treatment effects can be predicted by patient's comorbidities, frailty, and demographic characteristics. Patients at the 90th percentile of the risk distribution experience a 2.5 times greater increase in SAEs after treatment initiation compared to patients at the 10th percentile of the risk distribution yet are 4 times less likely to enroll in trials. The predicted SAE treatment effects for the drug's target population are 15% larger than the predicted SAE treatment effects for trial enrollees, corresponding to 1 additional induced SAE hospitalization for every 25 patients per year of treatment. We formalize conditions under which regulating representativeness of SAE risk will lead to more externally valid trials, and we discuss how our results could inform regulatory requirements.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policymakers at the state and federal levels have argued that restricting online sales of e-cigarettes is a crucial policy tool to curb youth vaping. This study is the first to explore the effectiveness of statewide restrictions on online sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) on teen and young adult ENDS use. Using data from four national datasets (Monitoring the Future, State and Combined Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System surveys, Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey) and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find no evidence that such laws are effective at curbing youth ENDS use. With 95 percent confidence, we can rule out that online sales restrictions reduced prior-month ENDS use by more than 3.6 percent of the pre-treatment mean vaping rate. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that (1) while restrictions on online sales may have a small negative effect on online purchases, youths are able to substitute to other sources for ENDS products to compensate for reduced online access, and (2) online sources are a very rare source of e-cigarettes for youths. Finally, we also find no evidence that online sales restrictions reduce adult ENDS use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a large-scale information randomized controlled trial to study fiscal policy impacts. Surveying approximately 9,000 households across five eurozone countries with varying debt-to-GDP ratios enables a clean cross-country comparison. The key finding is that the fiscal multiplier depends jointly on the financing method and the country’s debt burden: multipliers are smaller in high-debt countries when debt-financed but remain similar across countries when tax-financed. Finally, we develop a New Keynesian model featuring fiscal discipline, which reproduces the empirical patterns observed in the survey and highlights their underlying economic mechanisms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inspections are a common tool for acquiring information and incentivizing compliance. Although inspections are typically unannounced, their timing often follows a predictable schedule. We study how this predictability shapes firm effort and patient outcomes in U.S. nursing homes, leveraging detailed administrative data on staffing, care, and health outcomes. Nursing homes "slack" in the low-risk period following an inspection and ramp up effort as their next inspection approaches. Patient survival mirrors this pattern, suggesting that these fluctuations in effort have meaningful consequences for the quality of patient care. We embed these estimates in a dynamic model capturing how inspection regimes incentivize effort and provide information about quality. Our estimates indicate that moving to unpredictable inspections could induce as much additional effort as increasing the frequency of inspections by 12%, while only minimally reducing their informational value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examined the heterogeneous impacts of social security reforms in Japan over the past 40 years. We utilize a nationwide large-scale micro-dataset to compute individual-level social security wealth (SSW) and mortality rates by lifetime earning groups. We found that SSW declined for all groups after the social security reforms, which aimed to reduce generosity; however, the size of the negative impact was larger for richer individuals. These results indicate that a series of recent social security reforms have reduced inequality in SSW.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the empirical properties of firm-level productivity and distortions across countries using the newly released World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES). Using a standard framework of production heterogeneity, I show that the gap in productivity and distortions between high and low productivity firms is larger in developing countries, generating large aggregate productivity losses from misallocation. A key empirical property of distortions in developing countries is that they systematically weaken the relationship between firm size and firm productivity. I exploit a unique feature of the WBES data to document which specific aspects of the economic environment faced by firms, such as financial constraints, regulation, corruption, and weak infrastructure, are consistent with the empirical pattern of distortions across countries.</content>

    <title>Antitrust Enforcement in Labor Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Until recently, antitrust laws were rarely enforced in labor markets. Although the existence of labor market power has long been recognized, evidence only recently emerged that such market power regularly arises from sources that are actionable under antitrust law. Since 2010, antitrust agencies have substantially increased labor market enforcement actions. However, many questions relevant to enforcement remain unanswered, such as how to conduct market definition for labor markets, and how best to incorporate concentration into models of the labor market. This article reviews how antitrust is beginning to be used in labor markets, the evidence for and against its use, and the remaining evidence gaps standing in the way of more effective use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Joint custody following divorce is widespread, but implementation is costly when individuals live in different states and so affects interstate mobility. Migration of separated fathers has fallen significantly more than that of married fathers. We show the causal effect of joint custody using two strategies. First, we survey separated parents to elicit beliefs about the likelihood of interstate moves. Second, we use the staggered adoption of joint custody laws across US states, and show a reduction in actual migration of 11 percentage points for fathers. For mothers, there is no impact on mobility but suggestive evidence of beneficial labor market outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the years, the Belgian social security system has undergone substantial reform with a prime focus on increasing older worker labor force participation. The paper explores the effect of past reforms on inequality in old age.  We distinguish two separate effects: The mechanical effect considers the change in inequality and expected benefit levels due to the reforms for a fixed retirement age distribution. The behavioral effect accounts for the endogenous change caused by changes in the incentives to work. Our results show that mechanically, reforms have led to losses in expected benefits for all but the lowest income quintile. Behavioral changes had a positive but orders of magnitude smaller effect. Overall, inequality decreased as a result of reforms.</content>

    <title>The State Pension Age and Inequality in Old-age Social Security Wealth in the Netherlands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the early 2010s, the state pension age (SPA) is one of the main public policy instruments in the Netherlands for inducing people to postpone retirement. The SPA has gradually increased from 65 years in 2012 to 66 years and 4 months in 2021. In the context of the Dutch old-age social security system, an increase in the SPA is hypothesized to decrease the retirement probability and to increase inequality in pension benefits entitlements. Empirical support for the two hypotheses is found with data on individuals aged 55–69 over the period 2011-2021. Inequality in old-age social security wealth has increased after 2015 for non-retirees. However, the findings do not support that this increase is because of the SPA increase.</content>

    <title>Lenin's Shadow on the Istanbul Convention: The Legacy of Communism and Attitudes Toward Violence Against Women in Europe</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Istanbul Convention is an international treaty aimed at protecting women against violence. We employ survey datasets and investigate its effect on attitudes toward violence against women in Europe. Using difference-in-differences models we compare individuals in countries that signed and ratified the Convention with those in countries that signed but either never ratified or did so after the surveys were fielded. Entry into the Convention significantly reduced the likelihood that lower-educated individuals view violence against women as acceptable, but only in countries outside the former Eastern Bloc. In former Eastern Bloc countries, the Convention affected attitudes only among younger less-educated individuals who had limited exposure to communism—those who were no older than teenagers when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990. We show that younger cohorts in these countries tend to hold more individualistic and less pro-government attitudes and express greater trust in the courts and the justice system than older individuals. Finally, we find no effect of the Convention on attitudes toward other forms of norm-violating behavior, such as tax evasion, bribery, fare evasion, or drug use. These results indicate that the Convention had a targeted impact, and that its influence on shaping preferences depends on the broader cultural context which is itself shaped by institutions.</content>

    <title>Social Security Reforms and Inequality among Older Workers in Spain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter studies social security reforms and trends in inequalities among older workers over the last decades in Spain. Its main goal is to analyze the redistributive impact of the various pension reforms on older income inequality. Compared to the rules in 1985, recent pension reforms have led to an average increase on Social Security Wealth of approximately 18,000€ for men and 15,000€ for women. This represents a ten and eight percent increase, respectively. This effect is mostly driven by the mechanical or direct effect (e.g. via benefit adjustments), while changes in retirement probability (secondary or behavioral effect) are close to zero. Furthermore, we find striking differences across income quartiles, for both men and women. In both cases, there is a clear income gradient, where the richest quartile has benefitted the most with an increase close to twenty percent, or over €50,000, for both men and women. Conversely, the change for the poorest income quartile for men and the two poorest income quartiles for women is close to zero or even slightly negative. This is likely due to the effect of minimum benefits (that mark the generosity of the system, see Boldrin et al, 1999) that automatically absorb any other effect for low-income individuals.</content>

    <title>Pension Reforms and Inequalities in France</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study analyzes the distributional effects of French pension reforms from 1993 to 2014 across different socioeconomic groups. Using administrative data for individuals born between 1934 and 1950, we examine the impact on social security wealth (SSW) across lifetime earnings deciles and genders. Our methodology incorporates differential life expectancy and exploits the PENSIPP model for counterfactual scenarios. Results show that reforms generally decreased SSW across all income groups, with regressive tendencies. The 1993 reform had the most significant impact, reducing SSW by over 15% for men in the lowest earnings decile compared to 5% for the highest. Subsequent reforms had milder effects. These findings contribute to understanding the long-term consequences of pension reforms on inequality and inform future policy decisions in countries facing similar demographic challenges.</content>

    <title>Financializing the Professions: The Rise of Private Equity in Accounting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private equity (PE) has moved rapidly into professional services, yet its impact on accounting, where licensing regimes, reputational capital, and partnership governance traditionally limit external ownership, remains poorly understood. We examine how PE ownership alters the organization and market structure of accounting firms using data from 1999-2024 that link more than 3,600 PE transactions to detailed information on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), labor markets, and audit pricing. PE investment increases sharply after 2020 and extends to both CPA-licensed audit firms and non-CPA advisory practices, with most activity in large mid-tier PCAOB-registered firms. After PE entry, firms grow faster: non-audit revenues rise, employment expands, and cross-state M&amp;A accelerates, consistent with platform-building and consolidation. These adjustments have market-level implications. PE investment raises labor-market concentration in key accounting occupations and drives up ERISA audit fees in a standardized setting, as confirmed by a synthetic difference-in-differences design. Our results reveal a key tension at the core of professions: preserving independence and competition in a market increasingly driven by financial capital.</content>

    <title>Medium-Term Impacts of Integrated Social Safety Nets: Cash Transfers, Information Meetings, and Home Visits for Child Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cash transfers are a critical part of social safety nets. However, integrated programs combining cash and parenting interventions through either group-based information meetings or home visits are recently being adopted to improve child development. Working with the Burkina Faso government, we conduct a randomized experiment in 225 rural villages to assess the impact of an integrated social safety net over the child’s life cycle. Villages were randomized to a control group or one of the following treatments: cash transfers; cash transfers plus government-run group-based information meetings focused on children’s health and psychosocial development; or cash transfers, information, and home visits reinforcing the information meetings. Fifteen months after treatment ended, households receiving cash, information, and home visits have fewer pregnancies, more medically assisted childbirths, enhanced health behaviors, and better educational outcomes. Adding home visits is essential for improving childhood development, while cash, with or without information, produces no lasting impacts.</content>

    <title>Examining the Effect of Cannabis Legalization on Youth Cannabis Use: Evidence on the Importance of Enforcing Retailer Compliance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies show that U.S. state cannabis legalization has increased adult cannabis use, but the effects on youth use are mixed. This study considers whether omission of enforcement of the minimum legal sales age (MLSA) might help explain prior mixed findings. We combine biennial survey data for 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students from the 2010-2023 Washington Healthy Youth Survey with administrative data on premise and compliance checks from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB). Premise checks educate retailers on any potential violations but do not involve penalties or fines. Compliance checks, on the other hand, involve increasing penalties imposed on retailers if they are found to be noncompliant with sales to minors. We use difference-in-differences (DID) methods that are robust to a staggered policy rollout with dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects and assess impacts of both types of inspections on past month cannabis use. We conduct a series of sensitivity and robustness checks of the impact of both types of inspections based on student’s grade, length of time since inspection, inclusion of alcohol/tobacco retail compliance checks, and alternative measures of cannabis use. Our research suggests that the implementation of regular random compliance checks with stiff penalties on retailers for noncompliance may help reduce the influence of legal markets on youth use. Unobserved heterogeneity within and across states in the enforcement of MLSAs may contribute to mixed findings of the impact of legalization on youth cannabis use.</content>

    <title>Electoral Margins and Political Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we argue that recent trends in party seat margins and election vote margins result from structural changes in the nature of US political competition. We assemble a comprehensive database of electoral results for the House, Senate and presidential contests, from the 19th century until today. Seat margins declined in the recent period, so the margins of control of the House, Senate, and Electoral College by either party have become smaller. However, this was not accompanied by a decline in the margins of victory at the constituency level. We propose a model of electoral competition with multiple districts that can rationalize these trends. We show theoretically that an increase in politicians’ information about voter preferences, together with the growing nationalization of politics, can account for the decrease in seat margins and the concurrent stability in vote margins. As implied by the model, we document that campaign contributions received by House and Senate candidates are increasingly concentrated in a dwindling set of swing constituencies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our analysis of novel data from hundreds of thousands of online auctions on a large platform operating in the Netherlands uncovers a tendency to bid round numbers. Round winning bids are higher than average for a given item and are eschewed by bidders as they gain experience. These findings lead us to hypothesize that, rather than delivering a strategic benefit (say, adding salience to a jump bid), round bidding is a symptom of a behavioral bias. We construct a structural model of behavioral bidding in auctions, estimated for each of a subsample of the most frequently auctioned items. Our median estimate is that 21% of bidders are prone to round-number bias, reducing their expected surplus by nearly 10%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study sequentially evaluates a soft-skills course implemented in Ugandan and Kenyan primary schools that replaced academic review time with lessons on goal-setting and related skills as students prepared for high-stakes primary school-leaving exams. An exploratory evaluation in Uganda provided evidence of positive impacts on girls’ test scores. A confirmatory evaluation in Kenya found that the course led to improvements in self-reported soft skills, especially among girls, although no gains in test scores. The study illustrates the utility of sequential evaluation, with exploratory analysis to identify promising hypotheses, followed by out-of-sample testing, as a tool to uncover heterogeneous effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines monthly earnings volatility and its transmission to household earnings volatility using Norwegian data on the universe of monthly pay histories. We document substantial month-to-month earnings changes: within a job, while over one-quarter of months have no earnings changes, another quarter have at least a 23% change. Accounting for multiple jobs and non-employment increases volatility, while aggregating to households reduces volatility by 12-35%. Event studies around job loss and couple formation, along with decomposition and bounding exercises, show that most of this decline reflects pooling effects rather than sorting or responses to shocks.</content>

    <title>The Role of Insurers in Health Care Spending and Production: Evidence from Utah</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private health insurers play a central role in determining the cost and quantity of health care in the United States. Despite this centrality, there has been limited empirical work studying how insurers differentially affect spending and consumption, especially for expensive and pervasive chronic conditions. We use hundreds of natural experiments involving employers switching their primary health insurer, together with a movers design, to estimate these causal effects. We find meaningful differences in total cost and prices for medical and pharmaceutical spending. Within-person changes in spending caused by forced reassignment across pairs of insurers, holding fixed plan generosity, are as large as 30% of total medical spending and 37% of drug spending. We also find substantial dispersion in insurer causal effects on health care spending and quantities for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions. We find strong evidence for drug offsets as insurers who causally increase drug utilization also reduce medical costs and quantities overall and by condition. Finally, we find that employers do not select plans that reduce costs for their employees based on the match between employee conditions and estimated plan treatment effects, leaving significant cost savings on the table.</content>

    <title>In-situ Upgrading or Population Relocation? Direct Impacts and Spatial Spillovers of Slum Renewal Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Slums are widely viewed as disadvantaged areas characterized by substandard housing and negative neighborhood spillovers that constrain local economic development. Governments typically respond with one of two place-based interventions: (a) in-situ upgrading that improves infrastructure and housing conditions within existing settlements, or (b) relocation of slum households to formal housing elsewhere in the city, freeing valuable urban land for alternative uses. We compare the direct effects and local spatial spillovers of these two approaches in Chile. We construct a 20-year national panel of slum polygons that integrates satellite imagery, census microdata, construction permits, administrative records, crime reports, and property-tax data. Using this dataset, we estimate how each policy affects the physical characteristics of slums and adjacent areas, and whether either intervention shifts the socioeconomic composition of residents. Our empirical strategy relies on Synthetic Difference-in-Differences for causal identification. We find that both policies reduce the share of land devoted to housing within the original slum perimeter — in-situ upgrading by reallocating land toward neighborhood infrastructure, and population relocation by reducing the number of slum households and housing structures. However, only in-situ upgrading generates durable improvements in housing quality and the socioeconomic status of residents. In addition, upgrading produces substantial positive spillovers in nearby neighborhoods, increasing formal housing investment and reducing crime. Moreover, administrative cost data show that in-situ upgrading is roughly one-third less expensive per household than population relocation, underscoring its greater cost-effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many socially desirable policies are not implemented because of their ex-ante unpopularity, but this unpopularity may be overcome through experience with the policy. In this paper, we examine how opposition to carbon pricing in the state of Washington turned into support after voters experienced a cap-and-trade policy with revenues earmarked for environmental purposes – "cap-and-invest." Analyzing voting behavior at the census block group level, we observe that support varies by political affiliation as expected, but experience consistently increases support across the board. Using a proprietary survey, we further show that the increase in support among voters in Washington state is specific to the cap-and invest policy they experienced; support for carbon pricing or climate policies more generally remained unchanged.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is income inequality in the United States primarily driven by disparities between ethnic groups or within them? The evidence reveals a striking pattern: 96% of U.S. income inequality arises from variation within groups sharing common ancestral origins, far overshadowing the comparatively small share attributable to differences between these groups. This pattern remains remarkably stable across time and regions.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Contemporaneous Air Pollution Exposure on Cognitive Performance in Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the short-term cognitive effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure using highly time-resolved, individual-level data collected during cognitive testing in Kenya. By linking real-time portable monitor readings to Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) scores, we identify acute impacts of pollution on general and domain-specific cognition. Higher PM2.5 exposure during testing is associated with lower cognitive performance, particularly in memory, executive function, and visuospatial tasks. Nonlinear models suggest threshold effects, with larger declines at higher exposure levels. Notably, effects are significantly larger among more educated individuals, possibly due to greater task demands or lower chronic exposure that limits physiological adaptation. Given that cognitive impairment is evident even at PM2.5 levels below Kenya’s annual regulatory threshold of 35 μg/m³, the findings suggest that short-term exposure may impose underappreciated human capital costs that current regulatory standards fail to mitigate. The results highlight the potential cognitive and economic returns to interventions that reduce air pollution exposures in low-resource settings.</content>

    <title>The Labor Market and Health Impacts of Reducing Cesarean Section Deliveries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in three births in the United States is delivered by cesarean section (c-section). This paper studies the labor market and health effects of c-sections, using newly linked administrative data that combines the universe of California birth records with mothers’ quarterly earnings. We analyze the impact of an intervention that reduced c-section rates among low-risk first-time births, and find that mothers exposed to the intervention appear to have a higher likelihood of employment in the quarter following birth, as well as a higher likelihood of returning to their pre-birth employer. These impacts attenuate over time—suggesting that a c-section primarily delays return to the labor market following childbirth—but attachment to the pre-birth employer remains higher five quarters post-birth. We find no evidence of significant impacts on maternal or infant health, indicating that the intervention-induced decline in c-sections did not come at the cost of worse outcomes. Further, among mothers who have another child, we find that exposure to the intervention at the first birth leads to a lower likelihood of c-section and preterm delivery at the second one, implying that both the economic and health benefits of reduced c-sections may compound with birth order.</content>

    <title>Default and Interest Rate Shocks: Renegotiation Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a sovereign default model with debt renegotiation in which interest-rate shocks affect default incentives through two mechanisms. Under the standard mechanism, higher interest rates tighten the government’s budget constraint. Under the renegotiation mechanism, higher rates increase lenders’ opportunity cost of holding delinquent debt, which makes lenders accept larger haircuts and makes default more attractive for the government. We argue that our novel renegotiation mechanism reconciles standard sovereign default models with the narrative that the sharp increase in the real interest rate in the United States was a relevant factor in the defaults of the early 1980s.</content>

    <title>Overlapping Policy Interventions: Evidence from Home Health</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments often concurrently deploy multiple policy instruments to tackle a common objective, yet researchers typically analyze each policy's impacts independently. We study interactions across policies and their implications within the context of efforts to reduce Medicare-financed home health services. We consider two geographically targeted policies:  strike force prosecutions of suspected fraud and moratoria on the entry of new home health agencies. Depending on location and time, we observe either both, one, or neither policy in place. Individually, each policy reduced home health use substantially, and was well-targeted to places with higher treatment effects. Although we estimate only a modest interaction between the two policies, we find that optimally allocating them across the areas that received at least one policy could have increased their total impact by about 20% relative to the observed placement. Our exercise highlights the potential gains from coordination across different policy instruments pursuing similar objectives.</content>

    <title>Explaining the Widening Divides in US Midlife Mortality: Is There a Smoking Gun?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The education-mortality gradient has increased sharply in the last three decades, with the life-expectancy gap between people with and without a college degree widening from 2.6 years in 1992 to 6.3 years in 2019 (Case and Deaton 2023). During the same period, mortality inequality across counties rose 30 percent, accompanied by an increasing rural health penalty. Using county- and state-level data from the 1992–2019 period, we demonstrate that these three trends arose due to a fundamental shift in the geographic patterns of mortality among college and non-college populations. First, we find a sharp decline in both mortality rates and geographic inequality for college graduates. Second, the reverse was true for people without a college degree; spatial inequality became amplified. Third, we find that rates of smoking play a key role in explaining all three empirical puzzles, with secondary roles attributed to income, other health behaviors, and state policies. Less well-understood is why “place effects” matter so much for smoking (and mortality) for those without a college degree.</content>

    <title>Long-run Effects of Universal Pre-Primary Education Expansion: Evidence from Argentina</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the long-run effects of a large public expansion of pre-primary educa- tion in Argentina. Between 1993 and 1999 the federal government financed the construction of new preschool classrooms targeted to departments with low base- line enrollment and high poverty, creating roughly 186,000 additional places. We link administrative records on classroom construction to four population censuses and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare treated and untreated cohorts across high- and low-construction departments. An additional preschool seat per child increases post-kindergarten schooling by about 0.5 years, raising the probability of completing secondary school by 11.9 percentage points and of enrolling in post-secondary education by 7.1 percentage points. For women, access to the program also reduces completed fertility: an additional seat lowers the number of live births per woman by 0.18, and we find no evidence that selective migration biases these estimates. We find little impact on labor-market outcomes at the census date, consistent with beneficiaries still being in school or in the early stages of their careers. A benefit-cost analysis based on the estimated schooling gains, standard Mincer returns, and observed construction and operating costs yields a benefit-cost ratio of about 11 and an internal rate of return of 13%. Our findings show that universal at-scale pre-primary expansions in middle-income countries can generate sizable improvements in human capital and demographic outcomes at relatively low fiscal cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper surveys econometric innovations related to differences-in-differences estimators and event-study models with time-varying treatment effects. Our discussion highlights tricky normalization issues, heterogeneous policy effects, the interpretation of exposure designs, pretrends pretesting, and the ever-bothersome question of logs versus levels. Key ideas are illustrated with applications.</content>

    <title>Division of Labor in the Global Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper links globalization, worker efficiency, and wage inequality within plants to internal labor market organization. Using German plant-worker data and information on the task content of occupations, we document that larger plants (i) use more occupations, (ii) assign fewer tasks per occupation, and (iii) exhibit greater wage dispersion. We develop a model where plants endogenously bundle tasks into occupations, improving worker-task matching at the cost of higher fixed span-of-control costs. Embedding this into a Melitz framework, we show that trade increases worker efficiency and wage inequality in exporting plants, whereas non-exporting plants experience the opposite effects. Structural estimation and simulations confirm the model’s predictions and point to non-monotonic economy-wide effects.</content>

    <title>The Consequences of Abortion Funding Bans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do restrictions on public funding create unintended reliance on social assistance? In this paper, we study the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which barred federal funding for abortion. Using county-level data and an event-study design, we show that reduced federal funding for abortion increased fertility among young women by 2%. These effects were concentrated among non-white women, who subsequently experienced greater welfare participation in states with larger abortion funding declines. The consequences extend into the next generation: non-white girls born after Hyde were more likely to rely on public assistance in adulthood. Abortion funding restrictions reinforce long-run economic inequality across generations.</content>
