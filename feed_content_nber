    <title>onetary Economics at 30: A Reexamination of the Relevance of Money in Cashless Limiting Monetary Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The well-known cashless-limiting result in Woodford (1998) has become the theoretical foundation for a large body of work that treats the costs and benefits of holding money as irrelevant for monetary transmission. I reexamine this result and find that it relies on a peculiar credit-market structure consisting of perfectly competitive, zero-interest deferred payment arrangements. I show that the result breaks down when the microstructure is generalized to allow for an endogenous interest rate and market power in credit intermediation. The tenuousness of this influential result should give pause to the widespread practice of basing monetary policy advice on models without money.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate the passthrough of Treasury supply to bank deposits through bank market power. We show that a larger Treasury supply crowds out deposits with disproportionate effects in more competitive deposit markets. A larger Treasury supply further curtails bank lending and affects bank funding structure. The explanatory power of Treasury supply is not driven by other shocks to deposit demand and supply. In comparison, monetary policy rate hikes have a larger impact on deposit funding in more concentrated markets, consistent with the deposits channel of monetary policy. Our empirical findings are rationalized in a model of imperfect deposit competition.</content>

    <title>Military Spending and War</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit the theory of critical deterrence—the idea that military spending may reduce the risk of conflict by increasing its expected costs. To test this theory, we assemble a new cross-national dataset combining information on armed conflicts and defense spending over a 75-year period. We find that increases in military spending have no effect on short-run conflict risk—contrary to concerns that buildups may provoke escalation—but that they do lead to a small and persistent decline in conflict over the long run. Although the effect of spending on conflict is modest, its effect on the cost of war is large: higher military spending raises the scale of battlefield casualties. The effect of military spending on conflict is more pronounced for democracies, which are less likely to use force offensively, and is concentrated in internal conflicts involving nonstate actors. The deterrent power of military spending is strongest in ethnically polarized societies—precisely where the threat of civil war is most acute. Last, using dyadic data, we find that higher military spending causes a decrease in bilateral interstate conflict, and that this effect may be larger than the one we document for intrastate conflict using panel data. Taken together, our results point to a low pass-through from the cost of war to its incidence: even sharp increases in military spending yield only modest gains in deterrence.</content>

    <title>College Application Mistakes and the Design of Information Policies at Scale</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether large-scale information interventions can improve college application outcomes in a centralized admissions system. Using nationwide surveys from Chile, we document widespread information frictions and frequent application mistakes, such as omitting attainable preferred programs or failing to include safety options. To address these frictions, we partnered with the Ministry of Education to implement a large-scale field experiment that provided applicants with personalized information on admission probabilities and program characteristics through customized online platforms. The intervention increased the probability that previously unmatched students received an assignment by 44% and improved placement into higher-ranked programs by 20%. Building on these results, the policy was scaled nationwide, reaching all applicants. The scaled-up version, evaluated via an encouragement design, confirmed substantial gains, including higher admission rates for initially unmatched students and persistent enrollment improvements. Our findings show that low-cost, personalized information policies, when integrated into centralized admissions platforms, can substantially reduce application mistakes and improve student outcomes at scale. The results also highlight how leveraging existing market design infrastructure can enable scalable, cost-effective interventions that enhance efficiency and equity in higher education access.</content>

    <title>Model Uncertainty and Measures of Inequality of Opportunity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inequality of opportunity has great normative importance. This has led to a literature on measuring the part of overall inequality that is due to circumstances outside of a person’s control. We contribute to such studies by evaluating the implications of uncertainty about circumstance variables and linear versus nonlinear transmission of circumstances on inequality of opportunity estimates. Applying linear Bayesian model averaging methods and three ensemble tree-based machine learning approaches to data from 31 European Union countries, we find that ignoring model uncertainty can lead to substantial overstatement of levels of inequality of opportunity.</content>

    <title>Corporate Hierarchy</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Michael Ewens &amp; Xavier Giroud</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel measure of corporate hierarchies for over 2,500 U.S. public firms. This measure is obtained from online resumes of 16 million employees and a network estimation technique that allows us to identify hierarchical layers. Equipped with this measure, we document several facts about corporate hierarchies. Firms have on average ten hierarchical layers and a pyramidal organizational structure. More hierarchical firms have a more educated workforce, higher internal promotion rates, and longer employee tenure. Their operating performance is higher, but they face higher administrative costs. They are more active acquirers and produce more patents, but not higher-quality patents. They exhibit lower stock return volatility and more stable cash flows. We also examine how companies adjust their hierarchies in response to demand and knowledge shocks. We find that biotech companies increased their number of layers following the Covid-19 pandemic, while companies flattened their hierarchies following the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. These findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of existing models of corporate hierarchies.</content>

    <title>General Laws and the Emergence of Durable Political Parties: The Case of Pennsylvania</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In previous work we have highlighted the importance of revisions to state constitutions that mandated that laws be general and uniform throughout the state. Indiana (in 1851) was the first state to adopt a general-law mandate, but most other states followed suit by the end of the century—most of them in the 1870s. This paper focuses on Pennsylvania, one of the states that made the change in the 1870s. We show that the movement to revise the state constitution was led by Republican party bosses seeking to suppress factional strife they thought was threatening their party’s dominance and perhaps even its existence. Their effort succeeded. We argue that it was the shift to general laws in Pennsylvania and other states that led to the emergence of a party system in the United States dominated by two durable political organizations.</content>

    <title>How Much Tax Do US Billionaires Pay? Evidence from Administrative Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate income and taxes for the wealthiest group of US households by matching Forbes 400 data to the individual, business, estate, and gift tax returns of the corresponding group in 2010–2020. In our benchmark estimate, the total effective tax rate—all taxes paid relative to economic income—of the top 0.0002% (approximately the “top 400”) averaged 24% in 2018–2020 compared with 30% for the full population and 45% for top labor income earners. This lower total effective tax rate on the wealthiest is substantially driven by low taxable individual income relative to economic income. First, the C-corporations owned by the wealthiest distributed relatively little in dividends, limiting their individual income tax unless they sell their stocks. Second, top-owned passthrough businesses reported negative taxable income on average in spite of positive book income, further limiting their individual income tax. The top-400 effective tax rate fell from 30% in 2010–2017 to 24% in 2018–2020, explained both by a smaller share of business income being taxed and by that income being subject to lower tax rates. Estate and gift taxes contributed relatively little to their effective tax rate. Top-400 decedents paid 0.8% of their wealth in estate tax when married and 7% when single. Annual charitable contributions equalled 0.6% of wealth and 11% of economic income in 2018–20.</content>

    <title>Hopping on an Earlier Flight: Optimal Waiting with Multiple Flights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When should travellers leave for the airport? This paper develops a model for optimal airport arrival timing when travellers face uncertain travel times and can potentially board earlier flights. We show that access to earlier flights creates a ``recourse option" that fundamentally changes optimal behaviour. While earlier flights always reduce the probability of missing one's scheduled departure, they may paradoxically increase expected waiting time when travellers adjust their arrival strategies. Using renewal theory, we establish that with frequent service, the expected waiting time converges to half the headway between flights—a fundamental limit that cannot be improved through better planning. We connect the problem to newsvendor theory, showing how the fixed penalty for missing flights (rather than linear costs) leads to distinct optimality conditions. Our results explain why rational travellers should occasionally miss flights and provide practical guidelines for airlines designing standby policies and for travellers making departure decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare care for Black versus white patients following pulse oximetry, a widely-used device for measuring blood oxygen levels which over-estimates oxygen saturation in darker-skinned patients. Black patients are therefore medically more appropriate for follow-up care than white patients with the same pulse oximetry reading. Yet, using data from the Veterans Health Administration on 3.5 million emergency department visits between 2014 and 2018, we find that Black patients systematically receive lower rates of follow-up care than white patients with the same reading. Our findings illustrate how bias in a medical screening device is propagated and amplified in downstream care.</content>

    <title>Religion in Emerging and Developing Regions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the evolving relationship between religion and economic development in emerging and developing countries (EDCs). Building on large-scale survey data and recent scholarship,  we document persistent and, in many regions, increasing levels of religiosity. First, we present global trends in religious beliefs and practices, highlighting a religious divergence between EDCs and high-income countries, as well as the continued prevalence of traditional belief systems alongside major world religions. Second, we analyze the determinants and consequences of religious behavior, showing how income volatility, financial insecurity, and cultural transitions sustain demand for religion. Third, we explore the institutional and political dimensions of religion in EDCs, emphasizing the role of religious institutions as public goods providers and as politically influential actors. This discussion offers a framework for understanding religious organizations as adaptive, competing platforms in pluralistic religious marketplaces. Overall, our findings suggest that religious adaptation, rather than decline, is central to understanding the future of religion and its economic implications in the developing world.</content>

    <title>Practical Finance: An Approximate Solution to Lifecycle Portfolio Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on normative household financial choices almost always gives quantitative guidance in one of two forms: a simple formula for an unrealistic setting, or numerical solutions for only a few parameter sets in a realistic setting. We propose a middle-ground approach we call practical finance: analytic approximations to optimal solutions as a function of relevant parameters in realistic settings that are easily computed in a spreadsheet. We provide such an approximation for lifecycle portfolio choice with labor income. Across 5,103 parameter sets, our approximation results in welfare that is on average only 0.06% lower than that of the optimal solution.</content>

    <title>Robinson Meets Roy: Monopsony Power and Comparative Advantage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a number of insights into the nature and consequences of monopsony power through the lens of comparative advantage, where employers’ power in wage setting stems from match-specific rents. Chief among them is that employers will apply larger wage markdowns to workers with greater comparative advantage at their firm. This leads to stronger monopsony power over more productive workers, provided the workers’ comparative advantage aligns with their absolute advantage. Using Brazilian administrative data, we confirm this prediction: monopsony disproportionately affects high-wage workers within firms and workers at high-paying firms. The model, calibrated to our estimates for Brazil, predicts that minimum wages increase both wages and formal employment for more productive workers while pushing less productive workers out of formal employment.</content>

    <title>Reserves, Sanctions and Tariffs in a Time of Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the determinants of individual central bank holdings of international reserves, as shares of gold, dollar, euro, pound, yen and yuan, over the 1999-2022 period.  We augment standard economic determinants of size, exchange rate volatility, currency pegs and bilateral trade with bilateral political/economic variables such as disagreement in UN voting, military alliances, and financial and trade sanctions. These variables augment uncertainty measures such as global Economic Policy Uncertainty, US monetary and trade policy uncertainty, and the VIX. In addition, we investigate whether the US imposition of tariffs in 2018 had any measurable impact on dollar and other holdings. We conclude that financial sanctions and trade policy uncertainty have a statistically and economically significant effect on holdings of the US dollar. US tariffs had an economically – but not statistically – significant impact on shares of foreign exchange reserves: dollar shares fell by 2.1% and other shares rose by 0.8%. These findings can inform the debate regarding some of the benefits and costs of using such geo-economic policies.</content>

    <title>Selection Bias and Racial Disparities in Police Use of Force</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study racial disparities in police use of force. A pervasive issue in studies of policing is that the available data are selected by the police. As a result, disparities computed in the observed sample may be biased if selection into the data differs by race. We develop a framework and econometric strategy for correcting this bias, using variation across officers in enforcement intensity to identify the racial composition of the unobserved population at risk of selection. Using detailed administrative data on arrests and force incidents from Chicago and Seattle, we find that Black civilians comprise 56 percent of arrestees but about 49 percent of potential arrestees. Correcting for sample selection doubles our measure of the racial disparity in force rates. Decompositions of the corrected force disparity reveal that about 70 percent is unexplained by other demographic and incident characteristics, suggesting an important role for officer discrimination. Our selection bias estimates meaningfully impact the conclusions drawn in the existing literature.</content>

    <title>How Retrainable are AI-Exposed Workers?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document the extent to which workers in AI-exposed occupations can successfully retrain for AI-intensive work. We assemble a new workforce development dataset spanning over 1.6 million job training participation spells from all US Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act programs from 2012–2023 linked with occupational measures of AI exposure. Using earnings records observed before and after training, we compare high AI exposure trainees to a matched sample of similar workers who only received job search assistance. We find that the average earnings return to training among AI-exposed workers is high, around $1,470 per quarter. Low-exposure trainees capture higher returns, and trainees who target AI-intensive work face a 29% earnings return penalty relative to their high exposure peers who pursue more general training. We estimate that between 25% to 40% of occupations are “AI retrainable” as measured by its workers receiving higher pay for moving to more AI-intensive occupations—a large magnitude given the relatively low-income sample of displaced workers. Positive earnings returns in all groups are driven by the most recent years when labor markets were tightest, suggesting training programs may have stronger signal value when firms reach deeper into the skill market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether highlighting streaks—instances of repeated and consecutive behavior when completing learning tasks—encourages 4th to 6th grade students in Peru to increase their use of an online math platform and improve learning. 60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders with positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders, or (iv) to a control group. Highlighting streaks and providing personalized reminders significantly increased platform use compared to generic reminders and the control group, with streaks more effective on the intensive margin and personalized reminders more effective on the extensive margin. Highlighting streaks also significantly improved math achievement compared to the control group among the 1,500 students who took an endline test, although differences with other treatment arms were not significant.</content>

    <title>Outsourcing, Labor Market Frictions, and Employment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the labor market impacts of Brazil’s 1993 outsourcing legalization using North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness, and comparing security guards to less-affected occupations. We find that outsourcing legalization persistently reallocated jobs from older incumbent guards to younger entrants. Total employment of guards and their entry from informality persistently increased, while average demographic-adjusted wages remained constant. Meanwhile, a wave of occupational layoffs displaced some incumbent guards from high-wage firms. The evidence suggests that the rise of non-core activity outsourcing reduced labor market frictions, facilitated by firm-level economies of scale in human resources and spillovers to non-adopting firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fake product reviews—and the manipulation of reputation systems by sellers more broadly—are a widespread issue for two-sided platforms. We study two primary channels through which such manipulation can affect market outcomes: (i) creating misinformation about the reviewed product, and (ii) breeding mistrust in ratings system overall. To examine these in the Amazon.com marketplace, we measure misinformation by observing products purchasing fake reviews and measure mistrust by eliciting shoppers’ beliefs about the prevalence of fake reviews on Amazon through an incentivized survey experiment. We incorporate these into a structural model of demand in which consumers form beliefs about product quality based on observed reviews and perceptions about their trustworthiness. Counterfactual policy simulations indicate that fake reviews reduce consumer welfare, shift sales from honest to dishonest sellers, and ultimately harm the platform. Welfare losses arise primarily from misinformation that leads to worse purchases. While mistrust also leads to purchasing mistakes, the consumer harms of mistrust are largely offset by increased price competition under a weakened ratings system. Finally, we identify key limitations in platforms’ incentives to police manipulation and evaluate enforcement alternatives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and test a theory of firm size and scope centered on standardization: the extent to which a firm’s products are similar. Heterogeneous firms choose the number, quality and standardization of their products. Standardizing makes expanding scope less costly, which then increases the return to standardization. Standardized firms have endogenously higher marginal returns to scale—their marginal costs rise less sharply with scale—implying greater responsiveness to demand shifts. We construct a novel measure of standardization using detailed product characteristics and show support for the theory’s main predictions. We show that new product features from standardized firms diffuse more quickly.</content>

    <title>Expecting Harm? The Impact of Rural Hospital Acquisitions on Maternal Health Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While numerous papers document the effects of mergers on cost and quality, the effects of hospital mergers on access to care are less certain. Merging hospitals may limit access by closing one of the affected hospitals or eliminating individual service lines. However, hospital systems may have more resources to improve care delivery. We study the impact of hospital mergers on obstetric care in rural markets, where there may be heightened concern about the availability of local care options. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we find that when rural hospitals are acquired, there are substantial increases in the probability of obstetric unit closures, with resulting large reductions in the number of births at the hospital. We find mixed effects on health outcomes: there are small increases in maternal morbidity, but no changes in newborn outcomes on average. However, there are improvements of newborns with Medicaid coverage. Additionally, we find decreases in maternal transfers and increases in procedures consistent with women delivering in more resourced hospitals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider founders of limited liability firms who previously held jobs in the formal sector of Brazil. Managers are five percent of former job holders but their startups account for 27 percent of new firm employment. Relatively little of their overrepresentation as founders or the larger size of their startups is explained by their previous wages or other standard human capital variables. Among non-managerial former occupations we examined those clearly connected to demand (sales) and to supply (technology, purchasing). Only purchasing was comparable to managerial occupations in entrepreneurship and new firm size. Further examination suggests that a key to greater entrepreneurship and larger initial firm size is that workers’ former jobs entailed building relationships with other businesses: in demand-side occupations, they sold to other businesses; in supply-side occupations, they bought from other businesses.</content>

    <title>Composition Beats Collapse: Insights from the Bisin–Verdier Model on Endogenous Fertility Reversal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fertility rates have fallen below replacement in most countries, fueling predictions of demographic collapse and even human extinction. These forecasts overlook a crucial fact: societies are not homogeneous. Using the Bisin–Verdier model of cultural transmission with endogenous fertility and direct socialization, calibrated to U.S. and global religion data, we identify an evolutionary counterforce. Subpopulations with persistently high fertility survive, expand their share, and push the total fertility rate (TFR) upward over time. Even if every country’s TFR reaches a below-replacement level, the persistence of above-replacement groups makes extinction unlikely. Our simulations point to a future of growth with pronounced compositional change—driven above all by high-fertility religious communities—rather than collapse. In particular, in our baseline ten-generation world calibration, Muslims become the largest tradition by share.</content>

    <title>Openness and Growth: A Comparison of the Experiences of China and Mexico</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the late 1980s, Mexico opened itself to international trade and foreign investment, followed in the early 1990s by China. China and Mexico are still the two countries characterized as middle-income by the World Bank with the highest levels of merchandise exports. Although their measures of openness have been comparable, these two countries have had sharply different economic performances: China has achieved spectacular growth, whereas Mexico’s growth has been disappointingly modest. In this article, we extend the analysis of Kehoe and Ruhl (2010) to account for the differences in these experiences. We show that China opened its economy while it was still achieving rapid growth from shifting employment out of agriculture and into manufacturing while Mexico opened long after its comparable phase of structural transformation. China is only now catching up with Mexico in terms of GDP per working-age person, and it still lags behind in terms of the fraction of its population engaged in agriculture. Furthermore, we argue that China has been able to move up a ladder of quality and technological sophistication in the composition of its exports and production, while Mexico seems to be stuck exporting a fixed set of products to its North American neighbors.</content>

    <title>The Medium Matters: Medical Decision-Making in Telemedicine versus In-person Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The use of telemedicine has been on the rise. Although telemedicine has increased access to health care, little is known about how the medium changes providers’ medical decision-making. To evaluate how telemedicine differs from in-person care, we compare the quality and cost of in-person clinic visits and virtual visits over the phone for common conditions in Rwanda. To control for patient selection, we conduct an audit study with 2,532 standardized patient visits, where individuals portraying real patients presented standardized cases for malaria and upper respiratory infection (URI). We find that the quality of virtual care is higher than that of in-person care for URI and equally as good for malaria. Telemedicine providers also asked more questions about symptoms and medical history and prescribed more optional medicines for symptom management than in-person providers. We further find that telemedicine is more efficient than in-person care: virtual consultations were faster, had shorter wait times, resulted in fewer unnecessary medications and tests, and cost less for patients. Controlling for a rich set of provider characteristics, we show that provider selection does not appear to drive the results. Instead, better provider-patient communication over the phone emerges as a key mechanism. Providers report that it is easier to treat, get information from, and relate to patients over the phone. Providers also report feeling less social pressure during phone consultations. Consistent with survey evidence, we find that providers prescribe unnecessary antibiotics when asked by patients face-to-face, but not over the phone.</content>

    <title>Cumulative Risks of Foster Care Placement for U.S. Children: Comparing Birth Cohort and Synthetic Cohort Approaches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foster care placement is a far-reaching intervention that can have substantial long-term effects on children and families. Lifetime prevalence estimates are based on synthetic cohort life tables, which rely on a stationarity assumption that age-specific rates are stable over time. This paper uses a birth cohort life table approach for the 2000-2002 cohorts, where data from birth to 18 years allows us to observe lifetime prevalence of foster care placement directly. We find that 5.0% of children born in these cohorts were placed in foster care, including 10% of Black children and 12% of Native American children, with considerable heterogeneity across U.S. states. By comparing both methods, we see that synthetic cohort estimates were 17% higher than birth cohort estimates because placement rates for teenagers were higher at the point of synthetic cohort estimation than during their actual teenage years. We extend synthetic cohort estimates to 2019 and find similar placement rates by sex over time, increasing shares of placements due to neglect and substance abuse, decreasing shares due to child behavioral issues, and an increasing share of placements into kinship foster care. These patterns are similar regardless of the approach.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine disparities in acquittal rates and sentencing for Black and White soldiers in the US Civil War using all general courts-martial. We find that Blacks were disproportionately punished for group actions like mutiny and for violent crimes involving group violence, suggesting fears of large-scale rebellion influenced justice. However, we also uncover a system that was fair relative to many modern criminal courts in acquittals and in death sentences. The needs of the Army pushed towards fairness.</content>

    <title>Productivity and Wedges: Economic Convergence and the Real Exchange Rate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and the real exchange rate, specifically focusing on the convergence in price levels in Eastern European countries. While these countries have had significant convergence in GDP per capita (relative to the EU average) since the 1990s, convergence in real exchange rates for these countries stalled after the EU crisis. Using a standard theoretical framework, we estimate the main drivers of real exchange rates and show that a combination of productivity growth (Balassa-Samuelson effects) and labor market distortions help explain real exchange rate trends. We develop a structural two-country model that provides a rich decomposition of the long run determinants of the real exchange rate. Simulations based on observed sectoral productivities and labor market wedges show that the model can accurately account for the historical path of Eastern European real exchange rates, both before and after the EU crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program aims to reduce youth substance use by fostering multi-sector collaboration and implementing locally tailored strategies within the community. This study is among the first to evaluate the program’s impact on youth development outcomes in the United States. Using the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) difference-in-differences (CSDID) estimator, we find that the DFC program significantly reduces drug-related juvenile crime and improves academic performance. The effects are particularly pronounced in communities where coalitions include government agencies, highlighting the critical role of institutional coordination in mobilizing local resources. We also explore behavioral mechanisms, documenting reductions in marijuana use and opioid-related inpatient hospitalizations. A cost-benefit analysis indicates substantial welfare gains, suggesting that early-life prevention represents a cost-effective investment in public health.</content>

    <title>Labor and Product Market Power, Endogenous Quality, and the Consolidation of the US Hospital Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing structural analyses of the harmful effects of market consolidation focus on either product or labor markets in isolation, ignoring that product market competitors often compete for workers as well. This paper develops a unified framework for merger evaluation, finding that firms' simultaneous exercise of oligopoly power in the product market and oligopsony power in the labor market amplifies the harm from mergers to both consumers and workers. The model also demonstrates how merger-induced gains in labor market power incentivize firms to reduce product quality, highlighting an additional channel for consumer harm. The model's predictions are tested and quantified in the context of the recent consolidation of the US hospital industry. Linking panel data from several sources on all US hospitals from 1996-2022, a difference-in-differences design is estimated for nearly 150 high-concentration within-market mergers. Hospital mergers significantly reduce patient volume, increase prices, reduce employment, lower wages, and deteriorate quality of care, resulting in higher patient mortality. After recovering the structural parameters, the estimated model replicates observed merger impacts. Counterfactual exercises reveal that ignoring increased labor (product) concentration would lead one to under-predict the harm of mergers to consumers (workers).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how parental income and family structure during childhood and adolescence affect adult income, emphasizing the timing of these effects. Using an ordered multinomial probability model with functional covariates, we find that these familial influences are strongest in middle childhood and adolescence. We also uncover a complementary relationship in the effects of income and family structure trajectories during key developmental periods. By flexibly controlling for personal and family characteristics using nonparametric methods, our approach effectively handles high-dimensional covariates. The results advance the understanding of intergenerational income mobility and highlight the long-term importance of familial conditions for adult economic success.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine serial acquisitions in the technology sector from 2010 to 2023. Defining serial acquisitions based on a granular S&amp;P industry taxonomy, we find that they account for 24–37% of majority-control tech M&amp;A, with over half completed by public firms. Followon targets in a series are generally larger and older than the initial acquisition, and among public acquirers, starting a series is associated with higher market value and greater innovation value, but not with significant changes in market competitiveness. Among deals with valid transaction values, over half of serial deals exceed the reporting threshold of the U.S. Hart–Scott–Rodino (HSR) Act. However, in below-threshold acquisitions, acquirers primarily target their core business category. Accounting for the cumulative value of a series would, in most cases, keep the timing of HSR review unchanged or modestly accelerate it, but when it does accelerate it, review could occur several deals or years earlier, potentially yielding important benefits in markets with long acquisition sequences. Finally, while Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM) stand out from the rest of the sample for more frequent serial acquisitions, some other large acquirers display similar patterns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using novel scenario-based survey questions that randomize the expected duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Middle East conflict, we examine the causal impact of geopolitical risk on consumers’ beliefs about aggregate economic conditions and their own financial outlook. Expecting a longer conflict leads European households to anticipate a worsening of the aggregate economy, with higher inflation, lower economic growth, and lower stock prices. They also perceive negative fiscal implications, anticipating higher government debt and higher taxes. Ultimately, households view the geopolitical conflict as making them worse off financially and it leads them to reduce their consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new facts about the largest American companies over the past century. In manufacturing, top firms in the 1910s, 1950s, and 2010s predominantly date back to around 1900. Even as this special generation persists, turnover among top firms has been substantial. In contrast, in retail and wholesale, we do not observe a special generation among top firms. We show in a model of firm dynamics that a special generation can arise from an industrial revolution, through the adoption of a scalable technology and learning-by-doing. Top firm turnover is matched by standard idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Time-varying market size growth rates or entry costs are not sufficient to explain the facts. Among retailers and wholesalers, learning appears absent, so a special generation would be harder to sustain. Our results highlight the potential for lasting nonstationarity among the dynamics of top firms, which can result from the long echoes of technological change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the simplest OLG models with capital accumulation, demonstrating three results that stand in marked contrast to those of the standard model: first, the possibility of multiple steady states; second, the possibility of multiple momentary equilibria under rational expectations; third, one of implications of multiple momentary equilibria is that dynamics may be marked by complex fluctuations (lacking even periodicity), but still within well-defined bounds. We provide quite general conditions (with general utility and production functions) under which in the simplest of OLG models, there can be multiple steady states, multiple momentary equilibria, and complex dynamics. Furthermore, we present a simple illustration of wobbly growth by incorporating credit friction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm price-cost markups may reflect (a) bigger step sizes from quality innovations that confer significant knowledge spillovers onto other firms, and/or (b) higher process efficiency than competing firms or other factors which bear no obvious knowledge externality. We write down an endogenous growth model with innovation step size and process efficiency as alternative sources of markup heterogeneity. Compared with the laissez-faire equilibrium, the social planner wants to reallocate research towards high step size firms but not high process efficiency firms. We then use price and productivity data across firms in French manufacturing to infer firm step sizes and process efficiency. We find that the planner could achieve faster growth by reallocating research toward high step size firms, and more so if high step size firms could freely license their innovations to high process efficiency firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Millions of people lose access to safety-net programs each year because they do not complete the required administrative processes. In a large-scale field experiment, we randomized outreach offering personalized assistance during the Medicaid renewal window to identify the impact of transaction costs on coverage loss. Our intervention – which provided information and assistance – simplified the renewal process without affecting eligibility, ensuring that avoidable coverage loss among eligible beneficiaries accounts for any effects we find. Sending pre-recorded calls offering free one-on-one assistance from health insurance navigators increased Medicaid renewal by 1 percentage point, a 1.5% increase relative to the control arm. However, the phone number on file was likely no longer valid for at least one-fifth of beneficiaries, suggesting some people did not receive their calls. Receiving the call increased successful renewals the most for tribal members (by 8 percentage points or 13%) and children (by 3 percentage points or 4%); receiving the call also increased renewals for people with income below the sample median (by 2 percentage points or 4%) and people with chronic disease (by 3 percentage points or 4%). Together, these data suggest that some eligible people, including those who need care, lose Medicaid because they struggle with the required administrative processes. The findings do not support the typical rationale for allowing barriers or costs to enrollment—namely, that they efficiently discourage participation by those who do not need or value the benefits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign trade has significantly contributed to global improvements in living standards, a reduction in global inequality since the mid-1990s, and the lifting of millions out of extreme poverty. These gains were supported by the rules-based international order established after World War II. However, these achievements are now under threat. Escalating trade wars risk not only causing significant economic harm to both the United States and low-income countries, but also exacerbating geopolitical tensions.</content>

    <title>Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Firm Wage Premia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper leverages a large minimum wage reform in Uruguay to study the effects of minimum wages on the distribution of firm wage premia. Wage inequality decreased substantially after the reform, with almost all of the decrease attributed to a reduction in between-firm inequality. AKM variance decompositions show that the relative variance of firm fixed effects substantially decreased after the reform. A time-varying AKM model reveals that this pattern was driven by a compression in the distribution of firm fixed effects, with low-paying firms increasing their fixed effect after the minimum wage increase. Both firm-level and worker-level difference-in-differences analyses show that the minimum wage reform had a causal effect on the compression in the distribution of firm wage premia. The results suggest that minimum wages can increase the supply of "good jobs" by "making bad jobs better", in addition to reallocating workers towards "good jobs".</content>

    <title>Endogenous Firm Ownership in General Equilibrium</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines firm ownership structures in competitive general equilibrium by introducing a model where ownership rights emerge endogenously rather than being assumed. By embedding the property rights theory of the firm into general equilibrium analysis, the model demonstrates how market forces determine both initial firm formation by entrepreneurs and subsequent trading of ownership rights. The key finding is that, in equilibrium, firms are created by managers who have long-term importance to performance, but these founder-managers then sell ownership to outside investors. This pattern emerges because managers can capture value through both the sale price and their ongoing employment relationship, while outside owners can only benefit through ownership. The model thus provides a novel theoretical foundation for observed patterns of entrepreneurial exit and reconciles competing approaches to firm ownership in general equilibrium theory. Additionally, it identifies a distinct economic definition of an entrepreneur as an agent whose human capital is valuable for firms even when they do not remain long-term owners. The framework generates insights into firm formation, ownership dynamics, and the nature of entrepreneurship while maintaining the core structure of competitive general equilibrium analysis.</content>

    <title>Union Bargaining Power and the Amenity-Wage Tradeoff</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how collective bargaining affects both wages and amenities. By merging collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) to linked employer-employee data in Brazil, I combine rich contracted amenities with wage information. I implement a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits a court ruling enforcing CBA continuation (i.e., ultractivity) to estimate the effects of union bargaining power. Strengthening unions raises wages and amenities without reducing employment—increasing retention despite some labor-labor substitution. A revealed preference approach shows that amenities account for 45% of total compensation gains. These findings suggest that collective bargaining can offset monopsony power, but employers retain the right-to-manage workforce composition.</content>

    <title>Tariffs, Trade Wars, and the Natural Rate of Interest</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the effects of tariff changes and trade conflicts on the natural rate of interest? This article investigates this question, using a multicountry, heterogeneous-agent trade model in which the natural rate of interest is determined by firms’ demand for capital and households’ supply of assets through their savings behavior. We analyze how the equilibrium interest rate evolves during the transition to higher unilateral tariffs and a global trade war. In the short run, tariffs reduce capital demand, and so the natural rate of interest must fall for households’ asset supply to line up with capital demand. In the long run, both asset supply and capital demand fall by similar amounts, which leads to little change in the long-run natural rate of interest.</content>

    <title>Firm Ownership and Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a theoretical micro foundation for how much pollution (negative externalities) a firm will internalize based on the ownership distribution of its shareholders. Small shareholders, compared to large ones, want the firm to spend more on avoiding pollution since they suffer less profit loss for the same environmental benefit. In particular, if a shareholder holds a share of 1/N, where N is the population in society, that shareholder's preferences align with a social planner's. Three theoretical predictions arise. First, small shareholders will systematically vote for a greener corporate profile. Second, firms with a smaller weighted median shareholder will pollute less. Third, countries with concentrated corporate wealth holdings and/or more individualized firm ownership pollute more. This implies that standard models of externalities in environmental economics and macroeconomics containing representative agents are either internally inconsistent or not fully specified.</content>

    <title>A Discrete Choice Analysis of Consumer Decisions: Nicotine Products in an Illicit Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates consumer stated preferences for manufactured cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, and vapes in Türkiye, with a focus on how product attributes shape choices of adult consumers. A discrete choice experiment embedded in an online survey examines the role of prices of these products, flavor availability, and most importantly the legal status of vapes. Results indicate strong price sensitivity, both to own prices and to the prices of substitutes. In addition, legal status emerges as a critical factor that shapes stated preferences: consumers exhibit a marked aversion to products that are banned or sold illegally. However, scenario analyses suggest that vapes would capture a substantial market share even under strict prohibition. The hypothetical scenario of a complete ban would likely have a modest effect on the cessation of nicotine products while shifting choices toward traditional combustible tobacco products.  These findings highlight the limits of prohibition and underscore the importance of regulatory design. In particular, the treatment of legal status, together with pricing and taxation policies, plays a decisive role in shaping consumer behavior and public health outcomes.</content>

    <title>AI Agents for Economic Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The objective of this paper is to demystify AI agents - autonomous LLM-based systems that plan, use tools, and execute multi-step research tasks - and to provide hands-on instructions for economists to build their own, even if they do not have programming expertise. As AI has evolved from simple chatbots to reasoning models and now to autonomous agents, the main focus of this paper is to make these powerful tools accessible to all researchers. Through working examples and step-by-step code, it shows how economists can create agents that autonomously conduct literature reviews across myriads of sources, write and debug econometric code, fetch and analyze economic data, and coordinate complex research workflows. The paper demonstrates that by "vibe coding" (programming through natural language) and building on modern agentic frameworks like LangGraph, any economist can build sophisticated research assistants and other autonomous tools in minutes. By providing complete, working implementations alongside conceptual frameworks, this guide demonstrates how to employ AI agents in every stage of the research process, from initial investigation to final analysis.</content>

    <title>Beyond the Taylor Rule</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve partially "looked through" the post-Covid rise in inflation and ultimately managed to bring about an "immaculate disinflation." The Fed's policy deviated strongly from the Taylor rule during this period. More generally, central banks with strong inflation-fighting credentials looked through post-Covid inflationary shocks yet experienced less inflation than more hawkish but less credible central banks. In light of this episode, we assess the degree to which the Taylor rule is descriptive, and the degree to which it should be viewed as prescriptive. While the Taylor rule (generally) fits well during the Greenspan period, it (generally) fits poorly in the early 1980s and after the early 2000s. Academic work has emphasized the role of the Taylor rule in preventing self-fulfilling fluctuations (guaranteeing determinacy). These concerns can be addressed with a shock-contingent commitment and are fragile to deviations from fully rational expectations. We discuss three reasons why optimal policy may not always imply a one-for-one response of interest rates to inflation (forward guidance, correlated shocks, and "long and variable lags"). The main challenge arising from such policies is not indeterminacy but erosion of inflation-fighting credibility and potential deanchoring of long-run inflation expectations. Only central banks with strongly anchored inflation expectations and large amounts of inflation-fighting credibility are likely to be able to look through inflationary shocks.</content>

    <title>In Money, We Survive: The Effects of Social Security Retirement Income on Longevity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An old and debated line of research examines the income-mortality relationship and finds mixed evidence. In this paper, we re-evaluate previous studies using a new dataset and implementing a difference-in-difference model based on a Notch in Social Security retirement benefits to overcome selection and endogeneity issues. We employ Social Security Administration death records and find a positive income-longevity relationship. Moreover, we find more pronounced effects among low-educated individuals and people from low socioeconomic status families. Analyses using census data suggest that part of the reductions in retirement income are offset by wage income due to post-retirement labor force participation. Past age 80, the net adverse effects of the policy on both income and longevity become more pronounced.</content>

    <title>Malfunctioning Democracies: Understanding Accountability Failures in Developing Countries</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Claudio Ferraz &amp; Frederico Finan</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter examines why democracies in the developing world frequently underperform in providing effective governance. We argue that these shortcomings stem from weaknesses in accountability mechanisms, which leave governments vulnerable to corruption, clientelism, and elite capture. Our framework distinguishes three accountability channels: vertical (citizens’ control over politicians), horizontal (checks and balances across state institutions), and diagonal (oversight by media and civil society). We synthesize the recent theoretical and empirical literature to assess how each channel operates, the conditions under which it succeeds, and why it often fails. A central finding is that accountability institutions rarely fail on their own; instead, they are actively undermined by political actors seeking to preserve rents and entrench power. This dynamic weakens electoral competition, erodes judicial independence, and curtails media freedom, producing a mutually reinforcing cycle of weak accountability. Additionally, we argue that sustainable reforms cannot be achieved by strengthening any single channel in isolation. Since vertical, horizontal, and diagonal accountability are interdependent, effective reform requires bolstering all three simultaneously. We conclude by discussing the implications of this perspective for future research, including the role of new technologies, political polarization, and candidate selection in reshaping accountability in developing democracies.</content>

    <title>Understanding Patenting Disparities via Causal Human+Machine Learning</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an empirical approach for analyzing multi-dimensional discrimination using multimodal data, combining human perception measures with language-embedding-based, nonlinear controls for latent quality to relax restrictive assumptions in causal machine learning. Applying it to the U.S. patent examination process, we find that, ceteris paribus, applications from female inventors are 1.8 percentage points less likely to be approved, and those from Black inventors are 3 percentage points less likely—inconsistent with legally prescribed criteria. Jointly studying multiple bias dimensions and their intersections for the first time, we uncover new biases, including an affiliation bias—individual inventors are disadvantaged by 6.6 percentage points relative to employees of large, public firms, a disparity larger than any demographic gap. Moreover, innovation quality, location, and other factors can mitigate or compound discrimination, and the disparities interact: for example, racial gaps vanish among public-firm employees, masking more severe discrimination against individuals. Existing theories such as homophily cannot fully explain the results, but a simple model of correlation neglect does.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As shortages of resources like water and electricity due to extreme weather events become more frequent, high prices alone may fail to curb demand, making shortages more common. We examine a power limit policy for residential electricity households that rations electricity consumption rather than setting it to zero, as in a traditional rolling blackout. We find that power limits can provide equivalent savings to large blackouts, even when generous. Additionally, due to selection, power limits reduce the number of households affected by a shortage event. We conclude by discussing the welfare consequences of power limits and their heterogeneous impact across households.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses high-frequency administrative data to show that the majority of U.S. workers experience substantial month-to-month fluctuations in pay, even within ongoing employment relationships. This earnings instability is pervasive, but it has been masked in past analysis of annual data. Moreover, this instability is unequally distributed: lower-income, hourly workers face more instability than higher-income, salaried workers. This is because earnings instability arises in large part from firm-driven fluctuations in hours. This earnings instability is a meaningful source of economic risk: we provide causal evidence that it increases consumption volatility and also leads to greater job separations, and we find that workers have a high willingness to pay to reduce earnings instability. These findings suggest that short-term earnings risk is a significant and previously underappreciated feature of the labor market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on the new integrated accounting framework of global supply chains (GSC) (Wang, Wei, Yu, and Zhu, 2025), we derive three types of economic dependence (producers’ dependence on upstream supplies, producers’ dependence on downstream markets, and consumers’ dependence on supply chains) that take into account of the presence of foreign invested firms as well as international trade. To measure indirect value flows between the origin and destination countries that are mediated through third economies, we show a need to go beyond both trade-in-value added and gross trade statistics. As an application, we derive new measures of inter-dependence between the United States and China.</content>

    <title>Characterizing Optimality in Dynamic Settings: A Monotonicity-based Approach</title>

    <author>
      <name>Zhuokai Huang, Demian Pouzo &amp; Andrés Rodríguez-Clare</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel analytical method for studying optimal paths in dynamic optimization problems under general monotonicity conditions. The method centers on a locator function—a simple object constructed directly from the model’s primitives—whose roots identify interior steady states and whose slope determines their local stability. Under strict concavity of the payoff function, the locator function also characterizes basins of attraction, yielding a complete description of qualitative dynamics. Without concavity, it can still deliver sharp results: if the function is single crossing from above, its root identifies a globally stable steady state; if the locator function is inverted-U-shaped with two interior roots (a typical case), only the higher root can be a locally stable interior steady state. The locator function further enables comparative statics of steady states with respect to parameters through direct analysis of its derivatives. These results are obtained without solving the full dynamic program. We illustrate the approach using a generalized neoclassical growth model, a rational (un)fitness model, and a learning-by-doing economy.</content>

    <title>The Industrial Revolution in the United States: 1790-1870</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the distinctive trajectory of American industrialization up to 1870, emphasizing how the United States adapted and transformed British technologies to suit its unique economic and resource conditions. Rather than a straightforward transfer of innovations, the chapter argues that American industrial development was shaped by path-dependent processes and historical contingencies—such as the Embargo Act of 1807 and government sponsorship of firearms production—that enabled the emergence of a domestic innovation ecosystem. The chapter offers fresh insights into how high-pressure steam engines, vertically integrated textile mills, and precision manufacturing techniques evolved in response to labor scarcity, capital constraints, and abundant natural resources. A particularly novel contribution is the detailed analysis of how American manufacturers substituted mechanization and organizational innovation for skilled labor, leading to the development of technologies that were not only distinct from their British counterparts but also foundational for the Second Industrial Revolution. The chapter also highlights the democratization of invention, showing how economic incentives and institutional support fostered widespread innovation among ordinary citizens. By integrating technological, economic, and institutional perspectives, this chapter provides a compelling explanation for why the United States developed a robust manufacturing sector despite seemingly unfavorable initial conditions.</content>

    <title>Missing Markets for Innovation: Evidence from New Uses of Existing Drugs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For large classes of potential inventions, intellectual property rights that are available on paper are either not possible or not profitable for firms to enforce in practice. In this paper, we show that these missing incentives yield quantitatively significant underinvestment in research and development. We develop a simple model that formalizes the conditions under which such missing markets for innovation arise. We identify an empirical setting—research into new uses for existing drugs—in which there is sharp variation in the enforceability of intellectual property rights on otherwise comparable inventions over time. We show that when intellectual property rights become unenforceable, research investment and commercialization nearly cease. In doing so, we test two claims central both to our model and the innovation literature more generally—that stronger intellectual property protection does, in fact, induce investment, and that heterogeneity in the availability of these rights distorts investment. The welfare consequences of inadequate incentives in our empirical context are large. Our estimates suggest that 200-800 new uses for existing drugs would have been developed under counterfactual policies. Measures of the value of these uses drawn from existing literature suggest that the social cost of this particular missing market is on the order of several trillion dollars.</content>

    <title>Artificial Writing and Automated Detection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly used for written deliverables. This has created demand for distinguishing human-generated text from AI-generated text at scale, e.g., ensuring assignments were completed by students, product reviews written by actual customers, etc. A decision-maker aiming to implement a detector in practice must consider two key statistics: the False Negative Rate (FNR), which corresponds to the proportion of AI-generated text that is falsely classified as human, and the False Positive Rate (FPR), which corresponds to the proportion of human-written text that is falsely classified as AI-generated. We evaluate three leading commercial detectors—Pangram, OriginalityAI, GPTZero—and an open-source one —RoBERTa—on their performance in minimizing these statistics using a large corpus spanning genres, lengths, and models. Commercial detectors outperform open-source, with Pangram achieving near-zero FNR and FPR rates that remain robust across models, threshold rules, ultra-short passages, "stubs" (≤ 50 words) and ’humanizer’ tools. A decision-maker may weight one type of error (Type I vs. Type II) as more important than the other. To account for such a preference, we introduce a framework where the decision-maker sets a policy cap—a detector-independent metric reflecting tolerance for false positives or negatives. We show that Pangram is the only tool to satisfy a strict cap (FPR ≤ 0.005) without sacrificing accuracy. This framework is especially relevant given the uncertainty surrounding how AI may be used at different stages of writing, where certain uses may be encouraged (e.g., grammar correction) but may be difficult to separate from other uses.</content>

    <title>College Loans and Human Capital Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;College loans serve as a double-edged sword for human capital investment: While they facilitate access to education, the burden of repayment may distort post-education investments in human capital. We examine the role of college loans and loan repayment policies through a structural model in which heterogeneous individuals, faced with borrowing limits, make dynamic decisions on consumption, borrowing/saving, labor supply, and costly human capital investment (via both college education and on-the-job learning a la Ben-Porath (1967)). We estimate two versions of the model using data from the NLSY79: one with natural borrowing limits and another with parameterized limits. Counterfactual simulations based on both models suggest that, relative to the standard fixed repayment plan, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans modestly increase educational attainment, lifetime earnings, and individual welfare. Although some generous IDR plans may result in losses for the loan program itself, overall government revenue is higher under IDRs than under the standard repayment plan when lifetime income taxes are accounted for, creating a win-win scenario for both individual welfare and government revenue.</content>

    <title>Banks’ Images: Evidence from Advertising Videos</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how banks strategically develop brand images and how these efforts influence franchise value and the transmission of monetary policy. Analyzing TV advertisements via video embeddings, we measure banks' images along three dimensions: pricing advantages, service quality, and building trust and emotional connections. Banks with high local market shares highlight service and trust. Banks lacking pricing or service advantages lean on emotional appeals. Banks tailor images to demographics, increasing minority representation in targeted areas. A border discontinuity design helps identify that banks' images affect deposit growth, spreads, and loan demand, leading banks to respond differently to monetary policy.</content>

    <title>Laboratories of Autocracy: Landscape of Central–Local Dynamics in China’s Policy Universe</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive collection of 3.7 million Chinese policy documents and government work reports spanning the past two decades, we identify 115,679 distinct policies and systematically trace their initiation and diffusion. Our analysis reveals three key findings. First, China’s policymaking has historically been highly decentralized, with local bureaucrats playing crucial roles in both creating new policies and spreading them. Second, since 2013, policymaking has become substantially more centralized, driven primarily by changing bureaucratic incentives—bottom-up innovation is no longer rewarded, while strict enforcement of central policies is. Third, our examination of industrial policies shows that centralization affects both policy suitability and effectiveness. Top-down industrial policies tend to align poorly with local conditions and are less effective at driving industrial growth, highlighting centralization’s costs. On the other hand, under decentralization, competition among local officials can distort policy diffusion, also undermining effectiveness. Our quantitative assessment of both distortions indicates that economic costs of centralizing policymaking in China have significantly outweighed its benefits.</content>

    <title>Robust Bounds on Optimal Tax Progressivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies optimal tax design when the cross-sectional distribution of types may be misspecified, and the government acts cautiously vis-à-vis these misspecifications. In models without such concerns, fat-tailed distributions imply positive—often high—top marginal tax rates. We demonstrate that even vanishingly small misspecification concerns overturn this finding, driving top marginal tax rates to zero. Calibrating concerns to observed variation in income distributions shows that taxes for below-average incomes remain essentially unchanged, while progressivity for high-income earners is substantially reduced.</content>

    <title>Global Working Hours</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Amory Gethin &amp; Emmanuel Saez</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses labor force surveys from 160 countries to build a new microdatabase on hours worked covering 97% of the world population in cross section. We also construct time series spanning over 20 years in 86 countries. Hours worked per adult are slightly bell-shaped with GDP per capita but weakly correlated with development overall. Hours worked by the young (aged 15-19) and elderly (aged 60+) decline with development, driven by growing school attendance and public pension coverage. Hours worked among prime-age adults (aged 20-59) are mildly bell-shaped with development for men while they are increasing for women. The fall in male hours in middle-to-higher income countries is driven by reduced hours per worker and is offset by increases in female labor force participation. These two forces have exactly compensated each other in many countries, leading to a remarkable long-run stability of prime-age hours worked. Labor taxes are strongly negatively correlated with prime-age hours worked both in international comparisons and overtime within countries. Controlling for government transfers only partly reduces the link between labor taxes and prime-age hours, ruling out substitution and income effects on labor supply as the only driver. Controlling for working hours regulations and the size of the formal sector eliminates this link, suggesting that regulations also play a large role in reducing intensive hours in higher-income countries.</content>

    <title>When Decentralization Works: Leadership, Local Needs, and Student Achievement</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies when decentralization improves public service delivery. I analyze a Chicago reform that awarded select principals greater autonomy over budgets and operations while holding resources largely unchanged. A meta-analysis of similar reforms shows substantial heterogeneity, including both positive and negative effects. Building on insights from public finance, contract design, and psychology, I argue that the returns to autonomy depend on the capacity of local decision-makers (i.e., principals in this context) and the alignment of their objectives with those of central authorities. Event-study estimates show that, on average, increased autonomy improved achievement by about 0.1 standard deviations, effects comparable to resource-intensive interventions but achieved at minimal cost. However, deconvolution analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity, with both negative and positive effects. Design-based evidence supports the theoretical predictions; high-performing principals benefit more, reallocating resources effectively (e.g., reducing class sizes), and schools with atypical student populations benefit more and may tailor services to local needs. These results highlight that local capacity, aligned incentives, and heterogeneity are central to the success of decentralization reforms.</content>

    <title>Job Mismatch and Early Career Success</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does being over- or underqualified at the beginning of a worker's career affect skill acquisition, retention, and promotion? Despite the importance of mismatch for the labor market, self-selection into jobs has made estimating these effects difficult. We overcome endogeneity concerns in the context of the US Air Force, which allocates new enlistees to over 130 different jobs based, in part, on test scores. Using these test scores, we create simulated job assignments based on factors outside of an individual's control: the available slots in upcoming training programs and the quality of other recruits entering at the same time. These factors create quasi-random variation in job assignment and hence how cognitively demanding an individual's job is relative to their own ability. We find that being overqualified for a job causes higher attrition, both during technical training and afterward when individuals are working in their assigned jobs. It also results in more behavioral problems, worse performance evaluations, and lower scores on general knowledge tests about the military taken by all workers. On the other hand, overqualification results in better performance relative to others in the same job: job-specific test scores rise both during technical training and while on the job, and these individuals are more likely to be promoted. Combined, these patterns suggest that overqualified individuals are less motivated, but still outperform others in their same job. Underqualification results in a polar opposite set of findings, suggesting these individuals are motivated to put forth more effort, but still struggle to compete when judged relative to others. Consistent with differential incentives, individuals who are overqualified are in jobs which are less valuable in terms of outside earnings potential, while the reverse is true for those who are underqualified.</content>

    <title>Adaptation Through Experience or Description? Evidence from an Experiment on Efficient Coding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The principle of efficient coding implies that the perception of monetary payoffs is shaped by the decision maker's prior beliefs. Specifically, payoffs that the decision maker expects to encounter more frequently should be perceived more accurately. Most previous tests of efficient coding rely on the decision maker's experience to shape the prior. We conduct a pre-registered experiment to test whether descriptive information about the prior affects behavior in a manner consistent with efficient coding. We randomize whether participants receive this information before the experiment begins. We find strong evidence for efficient coding; however, we detect no effect of information provision on behavior. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that experience quickly crowds out any effect of descriptive information on optimal allocation of coding resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can public R&amp;D investment in developing countries drive productivity growth? We study this question in the context of Brazilian agriculture and the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa), a public research corporation established in 1973 to develop locally suitable science and technology. First, we show that Embrapa redirected research toward prioritized staple crops and local ecological conditions, and increased research productivity, especially in remote and research-scarce regions. Second, exploiting the staggered rollout of research centers alongside heterogeneous local exposure to Embrapa’s technology development, we find that Embrapa significantly increased agricultural output, driven both by higher productivity and expanded input use. Combined with a model, these estimates imply that public R&amp;D investment increased national agricultural productivity by 110% with a benefit-cost ratio of 17. The decentralized structure, in which research labs were spread across many ecological zones instead of in a single hub, explains a large share of these benefits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the evolving trends and policy dynamics of international student migration, focusing on their implications for STEM workforce development and innovation. While the United States has remained a leading destination for international students, recent years have seen a plateau or decline in incoming students, contrasted by growth in countries like Canada, Australia, and emerging hubs such as China and India. International students, particularly in STEM fields, play a critical role in shaping host countries' innovation ecosystems, often transitioning to permanent residents and STEM workers. We review immigration policies, including post-graduation work and residency pathways, highlighting their varying impacts on student inflows and innovation. Policies in Canada and Australia have until recently eased these transitions, while restrictive measures in the U.S. and U.K. have posed challenges. By documenting these trends and policy shifts, we identify gaps in the literature and outline directions for future research at the intersection of international education, immigration, and innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Macroeconomic disturbances affect both current fundamentals and expectations of future fundamentals, but most analyses report only the total of these effects. The expectation response function (ERF) isolates the role of expected future fundamentals in a theory. Defined as the response today to a change in expected fundamentals at each future horizon, the ERF does not depend on the fundamentals' laws of motion, the information held by agents, or the assumption of rational expectations. In applications, we show that (i) the new-Keynesian model implies modest expectational effects of technology and monetary shocks, while (ii) markup shocks in a medium-scale DSGE model have far larger expectational impacts than the “puzzling” effects of forward guidance.</content>

    <title>Does Tax Avoidance Trickle Down? Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The wealthiest individuals frequently engage in tax avoidance, and public awareness of this behavior is growing. Such awareness may undermine tax compliance among the broader population, either by revealing strategies others can emulate or by shifting social norms to make avoidance seem more acceptable. We first document that individuals are less tolerant of both tax avoidance and tax evasion when carried out by the wealthiest households. We next present results from a field experiment on property tax appeals, which—like other forms of tax avoidance—is used disproportionately by the wealthiest households. Providing information about the appeal rates of the richest-1% of households increased individuals' perceptions of unfairness, but did not affect their own appeal decisions—measured via administrative records—or even their expected tax savings. Information about the prevalence of appeals among comparable households also had no effect. By contrast, information about the expected financial gains from appealing had a significant effect on appeal choices. In sum, while the public condemns tax avoidance by the wealthiest households, we find no sign that such behavior encourages similar actions among the broader population.</content>

    <title>A Chip Off the Old Block? Genetics and the Intergenerational Transmission of Socioeconomic Status</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Progress in understanding the role of genetics in intergenerational socioeconomic persistence has been hampered by challenges of measurement and identification. We examine how the genetics of one generation influences the SES of the next by linking genetic data from the Dutch Lifelines Cohort to tax records for 2006-2022. Our genetic measure is the polygenic index (PGI) for educational attainment. To isolate causal genetic effects, we exploit randomness in genetic transmission across generations. One generation’s genetics impacts the education, income, and wealth of the next. A 10-percentile increase in one generation’s PGI raises next generation’s education by 0.11 years. “Next-generation genetic effects” are also large relative to “same-generation genetic effects”: a 10-percentile increase in a person’s PGI raises their income by 0.9 percentiles and their child’s by 0.7 percentiles, indicating strong persistence across generations. We next turn to mechanisms: about half of next-generation genetic effects reflect direct genetic inheritance (“genetic transmission”). The remainder operates through environmental pathways (“genetic nurture”): one generation’s genetics shapes the circumstances in which the next is raised. This environmental channel is reinforced by assortative mating: high-PGI individuals select more-educated, higher-earning partners. Our findings underscore that genetics is one of the forces anchoring SES across generations.</content>

    <title>The Algorithm Advantage: Ranked Application Systems Outperform Decentralized and Common Applications in Boston and Beyond</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School choice systems increasingly use common applications, where students can apply to multiple schools on a single form, though schools make admission decisions independently. We model three application systems: a common application, a decentralized system with costly separate applications, and a ranked-choice system using a matching algorithm. Our model shows that while a common application may expand access, it increases competition and may produce worse matches than a decentralized system where application costs encourage more selective applications. Ranked-choice systems combine reduced application costs with preference-based matching that reduce mismatches. We examine these predictions by analyzing how Boston's charter school sector was affected when it adopted an online common application.  Counterfactual simulations suggest the common application performs no better than alternatives on several metrics and did little to increase access for disadvantaged groups.  A ranked system consistently outperforms a common application across various levels of competition and assumptions on preference stability between application and enrollment stages.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the risk choices of a firm run by an effort and risk-averse manager, where the firm’s initial risk exposure is only observed by the manager. By eliminating zero NPV risk, hedging can improve the ability of firms to efficiently induce effort from their manager. We consider conditions under which information asymmetry about risk exposure alters the optimal compensation contract. In some settings, asymmetric information has no effect on the manager’s optimal compensation. However, in other settings, inducing the manager to hedge rather than speculate requires the optimal contract to directly account for hedgeable risk. When inducing the manager to hedge is sufficiently costly, the optimal contract may restrict the use of derivatives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many interventions that “work” in small-scale trials often fail at scale, highlighting the centrality of effective scaling for realizing the promise of evidence-based policy. We study the scaling of a personalized adaptive learning (PAL) software that was highly effective in a small-scale trial. We adapt the PAL implementation for scalability by integrating it into public school schedules, and experimentally evaluate this adaptation in a more representative sample over 20 times larger than the original study. After 18 months, treated students scored 0.22σ higher in Mathematics and 0.20σ higher in Hindi, a 50–66% productivity increase over the control group. Learning gains were proportional to student time on the platform, providing a simple, low-cost metric for monitoring implementation quality in future scale-ups. The adaptation was cost effective, and its key design features make it widely scalable across diverse settings.</content>

    <title>Place-Based Variation in Health Care: Evidence from Mandatory Movers in the U.S. Military Health System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is increasing evidence on regional variations in U.S. Medicare utilization based on older patients who move.  Yet evidence is limited for younger ages in the U.S., and movers may differ systematically from those who don’t move. In this paper, we harness the mandatory migration of military personnel and dependents (age 5 to 64) to estimate supply and demand factors in a system of care in which military physicians are salaried and copayments and deductibles are negligible. In our sample of 3 million enrollees, we find that place or supply effects explain as much as 80 percent of the overall regional variation for both the entire sample and for active-duty personnel. These regional place effects are correlated across age groups, with correlations as high as 0.84 between middle-aged and older military enrollees. These regional supply-side variations cannot be explained by differences in health, financial incentives, or quality of care, but appear consistent with location-specific differences in physician beliefs.</content>

    <title>Measuring Neighborhood Change: The Issue of Ex Post Borders</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do more populous neighborhoods grow less quickly than less populous areas?  Is local housing price growth associated with initial population density? The Longitudinal Tract Data Base’s (LTDB) panel of Census tracts is the standard tool for measuring neighborhood change.  The LTDB is based on 2010 Census tract boundaries, and Census tracts are partially designed so that they have a similar level of population.  In this paper, we show that defining neighborhoods to equalize ex post population levels can significantly impact estimated coefficients in regressions in which population changes are regressed on initial population levels or with variables that are correlated with initial population levels.  Most obviously, if neighborhood populations are ex post equalized, then a regression of population change on initial population must yield a coefficient of -1. We address this challenge by offering five alternative panels of tracts using 1970, 1980 and 1990 boundaries, which can be thought of as ‘reverse LTDBs’.  The significant mean reversion of both population and housing units that appear in the LTDB before 2000 either dramatically ameliorates or reverses using the reverse LTDB.  Comparing the LTDB with the reverse LTDB also finds that using tracts based on ex post borders also can influence estimated growth relationships where other tract-level attributes such as house price are correlated with initial population levels. This does not imply that using ex ante borders always is superior; earlier borders almost always means fewer observations, especially in rapidly growing areas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use a dynamic general-equilibrium model with supply-chain adjustment frictions to  study the effects of tariffs on manufacturing employment. The model has four distinct  manufacturing sectors: upstream goods with high trade elasticities (“oil”); upstream  goods with low trade elasticities (“steel”); downstream goods with high trade elasticities (“toys”); and downstream goods with low trade elasticities (“cars”). I find that tariffs can increase overall manufacturing employment in the long run, but are likely to reduce it in the short run, and cause more reallocation of workers across these individual sectors than overall employment growth</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 1996, with United States fish populations in decline, Congress overhauled fishing laws with scientific thresholds for rebuilding overfished stocks. The law's impact is contested, and lawmakers have spent over a decade debating its reauthorization while countries around the world consider similar policies. We develop the first causally interpretable evaluation of this law, exploiting the fact that the European Union has comparable fisheries but only recently developed similar laws. Compiling comprehensive data on US and EU fishery status and management, we examine fish populations that decline to unhealthy levels and measure the effect of a policy that aims to rebuild them to health. We find treated populations increase by 52 percent relative to these counterfactuals, with both catch and revenue rebounding to baseline levels or greater. Analyzing fisheries' revenue, we find net present values are higher for at least 69 percent of rebuilt stocks compared to simulated counterfactuals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nursing homes face unique financial incentives that encourage under-investment in onsite clinical capabilities and overreliance on hospitals to triage and care for residents with dementia, contributing to high levels of health care spending for this population. A proposed solution to align incentives are Institutional Special Needs Plans (I-SNPs), which combine capitated financing with plan-provided onsite clinician presence. Using 12 million resident-quarters of data from 2016-2022, we exploit the timing of nursing homes’ I-SNP contracting to instrument for plan enrollment and estimate causal effects on hospitalization and other health outcomes. We found that I-SNP enrollment reduced quarterly hospitalization rates by 3 to 4 percentage points, which equates to one third of hospitalizations relative to the sample mean. We do not find consistent evidence of an impact on other health outcomes and quality of care indicators.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how foreign currency debt exposure shapes household adjustment to a large exchange rate depreciation. Using household survey and bank customer data during Hungary's 2008 currency crisis, we find that foreign currency borrowers cut consumption one-for-one with increased debt service, consistent with a foreign currency Fisher channel. Both the quantity and quality of expenditures decline, indicating a "flight from quality." Debt revaluation has a limited effect on overall labor supply, but there is substitution toward foreign income and home production. Our findings point to the relevance of open-economy models with incomplete markets, heterogeneous foreign currency exposures, and liquidity constraints.</content>

    <title>Should States Reduce Teacher Licensing Requirements? Evidence from the Rise of For-Profit Training Programs in Texas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of a Texas policy that relaxed teacher licensing requirements and created a large for-profit training industry. Using detailed administrative data, we show that for-profit-trained teachers have higher turnover and lower value-added than standard-trained teachers. But the policy significantly increased the supply of certified teachers, reducing schools' reliance on uncertified teachers with even worse outcomes. Exploiting variation in policy exposure across schools, we find a zero net impact on student achievement due to these offsetting forces. Thus lower licensing requirements improved access to teaching and reduced training costs without harming students.</content>

    <title>Efficiency Costs of Incomplete Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies misallocation caused by limited risk-sharing and imperfect consumption-smoothing. We measure these losses in terms of how much of society's resources would be left over if financial markets were complete and each consumer were compensated to maintain their status-quo welfare. Using exact formulas and approximate sufficient statistics, we analyze standard incomplete-market environments—ranging from closed-economy Bewley-Aiyagari models to multi-country settings with input-output linkages. We find that incomplete insurance against household-level idiosyncratic risk is very costly (about 20% of aggregate consumption) based on both structural models and sufficient-statistics computed using household consumption panel data. By contrast, the cost of imperfect international financial markets (abstracting from within-country heterogeneity) is roughly 5%, driven by the inclusion of fast-growing economies such as China and India. Unexploited risk-sharing opportunities among countries at similar levels of development, on the other hand, are fairly limited (less than 1%).</content>

    <title>Happier at Work? The Impact of Working at an Employee-Owned Firm and Working from Home on Job Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of working for an ESOP firm and Working-From-Home (WFH) on job satisfaction in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and the General Social Science (GSS) survey.  It finds that job satisfaction is higher for employees in ESOPs than for observationally similar workers in non-ESOP firms and for WFH workers than for their non-WFH peers.  Fixed effect analysis of the NLSY97 finds that both ESOP and WFH employment raise job satisfaction for the same worker when he/she changes work status.  The channels through which the two conditions raise satisfaction appear to differ: ESOPs raise satisfaction by increasing worker participation on collective workplace or firm decisions while WFH raise satisfaction by increasing worker flexibility in their individual work activity.  Both participation and flexibility also raise job satisfaction independently. The data further show ESOPs had more extensive WFH than non-ESOP firms during the Covid-19 pandemic.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a new method to endogenously partition society into groups based on homophily in values, using fractional hedonic games as a theoretical foundation. The between-group differentiation that results from this partition provides a novel measure of latent polarization in society. We implement this method empirically using U.S. data from the World Values Survey. For the last forty years, the degree of latent polarization of the U.S. public has been high and relatively stable. In contrast, the degree of values polarization between voters of the two main political parties has steadily increased since the 1990s, and is now converging toward that of underlying values-based clusters. Thus, growing partisan polarization in the U.S. is a reflection of partisan views becoming increasingly aligned with the main values-based clusters in society.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can economic tools help inform the puzzlingly low rate of flu vaccination? Existing interventions focus on misinformation or nudges, not preferences over or beliefs about vaccine characteristics. Using an online experiment, we find a key role for effectiveness and short-run side-effects: equalizing only beliefs and preferences about these characteristics nearly eliminates the vaccination-intention gap between the vaccine hesitant and confident. Fear of needles, inconvenience, and perceived long run health risks play smaller roles. The vaccine hesitant hold pessimistic but plausible beliefs about effectiveness but greatly overestimate side-effect risks. We estimate the impact of correcting inaccurate beliefs and potential subsidies on vaccination rates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Parents are crucial to children’s educational success, but the role of parental education in fostering academic excellence remains underexplored. Using longitudinal administrative data covering all North Carolina public school students, we document five facts about first-generation excellence gaps. We find large excellence gaps emerge by 3rd grade across all demographics and persist through high school. Yet, socioeconomic status and school quality explain only one-third of the gaps. The overarching facts reveal that excellence gaps re-flect deeper challenges rooted in parental human capital that manifest early and compound over time, rather than merely consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage or school quality differences.</content>

    <title>Substituting Talent with Transactions: Acquisitions as Responses to Immigration Restrictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms respond to talent scarcity caused by restrictive immigration policies. We argue that when firms cannot build capabilities internally through hiring, they alter their boundaries by engaging in corporate acquisitions to make up for the foregone talent and capabilities. Using data on 3,861 U.S. firms and their use of the H-1B visa program (2001-2020), we leverage two exogenous shocks—the 2004 H-1B cap reduction and the 2007-2008 visa lottery—and find causal evidence that firms make more acquisitions as their exposure to immigration restrictions rises. This effect is stronger for deals with purposes related to the skills of the foregone talent, for small acquisitions, for domestic targets, and for targets in places with higher concentrations of skilled workers.</content>

    <title>Utilitarian or Quantile-Welfare Evaluation of Health Policy?</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Charles F. Manski &amp; John Mullahy</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an alternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and studied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision making under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility. That paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of quantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a cardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual decision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic theoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related specifically to health policy. We then propose a procedure to nonparametrically bound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice time-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health economists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning measurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.</content>

    <title>Segregation, Spillovers, and the Locus of Racial Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a discrete choice framework to provide the first nesting of Thomas C. Schelling’s canonical models of racial segregation amenable to empirical examination. Using U.S. Census data from 1970–2000, we demonstrate a central role for spatial racial spillovers in shaping racial clustering, patterns of racial shares and housing prices at the boundary of racial clusters, and the locus of racial change. Our results on the locus of racial change conflict strongly with prominent prior results on racial tipping. Our theory provides a foundation for spatially stratified regressions. The strongest spatial effects in the prior work are not tipping, but the distinct biased White suburbanization. Tipping effects in urban areas remote from Minority clusters are small or insignificant. In urban areas proximate to Minority clusters they average less than half those reported in prior pooled results. Policies promoting racial integration must thus attend to the heterogeneous fragility of neighborhoods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.</content>

    <title>Insuring Labor Income Shocks: The Role of the Dynasty</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide empirical evidence on the importance of a relatively understudied channel of insurance against labor income shocks: transfers from (cash-rich) parents to (cash-short) children when the latter experience negative wage shocks. Matching population data for Norway across two generations, we establish several results. First, parents make a transfer—i.e., run down liquid assets—when adult children experience negative labor income shocks. Consistent with dynastic insurance, we observe no transfers when income shocks are positive. Second, parents' responses depend on the nature of the shock. If losses are temporary, parents dissave; if they are persistent, parents save in order to make future transfers. Parental transfers offset 43% of temporary and 27% of persistent losses. Third, insurance is lower when children have other smoothing options, like spousal labor supply, and is greater for shocks to their own child versus a child’s spouse. Support also increases if the spouse’s parents can contribute, suggesting “competition for attention.” Lastly, insurance flows are one-way: children do not insure their parents against income losses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs are known to be key drivers of economic growth, and the rise of online platforms and the broader "gig economy" has led self-employment to surge in recent decades. Yet the young and small businesses associated with this activity are often absent from economic data. In this paper, we explore a novel longitudinal dataset that covers the owners of tens of millions of the smallest businesses: those without employees.  We produce three new sets of statistics on the rapidly growing set of nonemployer businesses.  First, we measure transitions between self-employment and wage and salary jobs. Second, we describe nonemployer business entry and exit, as well as transitions between legal form (e.g., sole proprietorship to S corporation).

    <title>Human Capital and Racial Inequality in the US Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;If racial gaps in measures of human capital like educational attainment and standardized test scores were eliminated, what would happen to racial disparities in wages, employment, and other labor market outcomes? A credible answer to this question is foundational for understanding the nature and scope of racial inequality and discrimination in the United States. This article reviews and synthesizes a literature that studies this question by estimating the extent to which controlling for measures of human capital changes Black-white gaps in labor market outcomes, and discusses various conceptual and methodological issues related to interpreting this type of exercise. I show that while accurately interpreting this exercise and its many variants requires careful thinking, the results elucidate many important and subtle aspects of racial inequality in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of state paid sick leave (PSL) mandates on mental healthcare use. To do so, we use all-payer health insurance claims data from IQVIA 2015-2022 combined with difference-in-differences methods. Findings suggest that overall mental healthcare use does not change post-PSL mandate. The null finding overall masks clinically relevant changes along the intensive margin: patients substitute away from lower levels of care to higher levels of care as time constraints are relaxed. Further, analysis of survey data hints that this change in treatment use improves mental health. Keywords: Paid sick leave; social insurance; social insurance.</content>

    <title>Deep Learning for Solving Economic Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, is transforming research across many fields, including economics. Its impact is particularly strong in solving equilibrium economic models. These models often lack closed-form solutions, so economists have relied on numerical methods such as value function iteration, perturbation, and projection techniques. While powerful, these approaches face the curse of dimensionality, making global solutions computationally infeasible as the number of state variables increases. Recent advances in deep learning offer a new paradigm: flexible tools that efficiently approximate complex functions, manage high-dimensional problems, and expand the reach of quantitative economics. After introducing the basic concepts of deep learning, I illustrate the approach with the neoclassical growth model and discuss related ideas, including the double descent phenomenon and implicit regularization.</content>

    <title>More to Live for: Health Investment Responses to Expected Retirement Wealth in Chile</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important but poorly understood way that economic development may influence health is through the private incentives that it creates for individuals to invest in their own health.  In this paper, we study how individuals' forward-looking health investments respond to changes in expected future (but not current) wealth. Focusing on institutional features of Chile's public pension overhaul in 1981, we link administrative microdata to a detailed household panel survey, and we then exploit discrete breaks in the resulting cohort pension wealth profile using a fuzzy regression kink design (RKD). Although theoretically ambiguous, empirically we find that greater expected pension wealth increases the use of important preventive medical care (and to a lesser extent, promotes more costly healthy lifestyle behaviors) – leading to measurable increases in chronic disease diagnosis (a requisite for appropriate disease management), reductions in disease prevalence, and measurably lower mortality in old age (particularly due to chronic diseases). In general, these results provide new evidence that economic development can have a meaningful incentive effect on health.</content>

    <title>Abortion, Economic Hardship, and Crime</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how abortion access affects economic hardship and crime. Using a database of abortion provider locations and operations in Texas from 2009–2019, we exploit variation in travel distance to the nearest facility created by clinic closures following the enforcement of Texas HB-2 in 2013. We confirm previous evidence that increased distance to the nearest abortion facility reduces abortions and increases births. We provide novel evidence that reduced access to abortion also leads to significant economic hardship, reflected in lower labor force participation, rising debt, widening income inequality, and heightened housing insecurity. This financial strain translates into higher rates of financially motivated crime, such as theft and burglary, with no significant effect on violent crime. These effects extend beyond directly affected individuals, reflecting intrahousehold spillovers. These findings suggest far-reaching consequences of restricted access to reproductive healthcare.</content>

    <title>Do Markets Believe in Transformative AI?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic theory predicts that transformative technologies may influence interest rates by changing growth expectations, increasing uncertainty about growth, or raising concerns about existential risk.  Examining US bond yields around major AI model releases in 2023-4, we find economically large and statistically significant movements concentrated at longer maturities. The median and mean yield responses across releases in our sample are negative: long-term Treasury, TIPS, and corporate yields fall and remain lower for weeks.  Viewed through the lens of a simple, representative agent consumption-based asset pricing model, these declines correspond to downward revisions in expected consumption growth and/or a reduction in the perceived probability of extreme outcomes such as existential risk or arrival of a post-scarcity economy. By contrast, changes in consumption growth uncertainty do not appear to drive our results</content>

    <title>Inward and Outward Migration under Shifting Legal-Democratic Regimes</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the two-way relationship between international migration and political regime change, highlighting a feedback loop in which political shifts shape migration flows, while migration itself reshapes political trajectories. Relying on a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework and a dataset combining migration flows, regime quality indicators (CHRI), and measures of international integration, we identify three central results.
First, substantial immigration into politically fragile democracies undermines institutional quality. The 2015 Syrian shock provides a particularly valuable exogenous case: a sudden, large-scale refugee inflow that bypassed domestic policy controls and provoked sharp political responses, allowing for clearer identification of immigration’s institutional effects. Second, democratic decline increases emigration, draining human capital and further weakening prospects for democratic recovery. Third, international integration—most notably through EU accession—conditions these dynamics, amplifying or dampening the outflow response to political change.
Taken together, these findings show that migration is not merely a symptom of political instability but also a driver of institutional transformation, simultaneously reinforcing and accelerating regime shifts toward illiberalism.</content>

    <title>The Theory of Financial Stability Meets Reality: A Unifying Framework for Bank Regulation and Accounting Discretion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature at the intersection of economics and finance offers prescriptions for regulating banks to increase financial stability. This literature abstracts from the discretion that accounting standards give banks over financial reporting, creating a gap between the information assumed to be available to regulators in models of optimal regulation and the information available to regulators in reality. We bridge insights from the economics, finance, and accounting literatures to synthesize knowledge about the design and implementation of bank regulation and identify areas where more work is needed. We present a simple framework for organizing the relevant ideas, namely the externalities that motivate bank regulation, the rationales for allowing accounting discretion, and the use of discretion to circumvent regulation. Our takeaway from reviewing work in these areas is that academic studies of bank regulation and accounting discretion require a more unified approach to design optimal policy for the real world.</content>

    <title>Automation-Induced Innovation Shift</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how exposure to automation affects the nature and level of corporate innovation, which informs how innovation begets innovation. We document that firms with high robot exposure alter their technological focus over time and shift innovative activities towards AI which automation naturally complements through data accumulation. The shift is more pronounced for firms with greater data generation or prior AI-related research experience. Because AI patents are more costly (e.g., in labor input), albeit more general and original, firms with high automation experience a significant rise in R&amp;D expenditure but an initial drop in patent quantity, before benefiting—an innovation “J-Curve.” Our findings not only resolve the puzzle that globally firms invent less despite the greater research effort amidst rising automation, but also provides insights on the heterogeneous paths of innovation, all of which we rationalize in a parsimonious dynamic equilibrium model.</content>

    <title>Social Substitution? Time Use Responses to Increased Workplace Isolation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how people adjust their time use when they experience an increase in time spent alone, which is a growing share of adults’ lives. We utilize the dramatic rise in remote work following the onset of the pandemic, which is associated with a large decline in time spent in the physical presence of non-household members during the workday, to observe the extent to which individuals substitute toward more in-person interactions in non-work settings. We first document that on days that individuals work from home, they spend 3.5 additional hours in activities spent entirely alone and over 5 fewer hours in activities that include any non-household members. We then use a difference-in-difference strategy to ask what happens to time allocations when workers are induced toward remote work by analyzing changes over time in how workers in teleworkable occupations—who experienced the lion’s share of the post-COVID increase in remote work—spend their time relative to workers in non-teleworkable occupations. Averaging over all days of the week, we see a relative increase in time spent in activities spent entirely alone by 32 minutes and a decrease in activities that include any non-household members by 38 minutes for workers in teleworkable jobs. Normalizing by the increase in average daily remote work time (46 minutes), these estimates are of a similar magnitude to what we observe in our descriptive analysis. When individuals are induced to work from home, they exhibit almost no substitution toward spending more time with others who are not in their household to make up for the loss of time with others at work.</content>
