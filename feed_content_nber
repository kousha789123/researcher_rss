    <title>In-situ Upgrading or Population Relocation? Direct Impacts and Spatial Spillovers of Slum Renewal Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Slums are widely viewed as disadvantaged areas characterized by substandard housing and negative neighborhood spillovers that constrain local economic development. Governments typically respond with one of two place-based interventions: (a) in-situ upgrading that improves infrastructure and housing conditions within existing settlements, or (b) relocation of slum households to formal housing elsewhere in the city, freeing valuable urban land for alternative uses. We compare the direct effects and local spatial spillovers of these two approaches in Chile. We construct a 20-year national panel of slum polygons that integrates satellite imagery, census microdata, construction permits, administrative records, crime reports, and property-tax data. Using this dataset, we estimate how each policy affects the physical characteristics of slums and adjacent areas, and whether either intervention shifts the socioeconomic composition of residents. Our empirical strategy relies on Synthetic Difference-in-Differences for causal identification. We find that both policies reduce the share of land devoted to housing within the original slum perimeter — in-situ upgrading by reallocating land toward neighborhood infrastructure, and population relocation by reducing the number of slum households and housing structures. However, only in-situ upgrading generates durable improvements in housing quality and the socioeconomic status of residents. In addition, upgrading produces substantial positive spillovers in nearby neighborhoods, increasing formal housing investment and reducing crime. Moreover, administrative cost data show that in-situ upgrading is roughly one-third less expensive per household than population relocation, underscoring its greater cost-effectiveness.</content>

    <title>Experiencing Carbon Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many socially desirable policies are not implemented because of their ex-ante unpopularity, but this unpopularity may be overcome through experience with the policy. In this paper, we examine how opposition to carbon pricing in the state of Washington turned into support after voters experienced a cap-and-trade policy with revenues earmarked for environmental purposes – "cap-and-invest." Analyzing voting behavior at the census block group level, we observe that support varies by political affiliation as expected, but experience consistently increases support across the board. Using a proprietary survey, we further show that the increase in support among voters in Washington state is specific to the cap-and invest policy they experienced; support for carbon pricing or climate policies more generally remained unchanged.</content>

    <title>Explaining the Widening Divides in US Midlife Mortality: Is There a Smoking Gun?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The education-mortality gradient has increased sharply in the last three decades, with the life-expectancy gap between people with and without a college degree widening from 2.6 years in 1992 to 6.3 years in 2019 (Case and Deaton 2023). During the same period, mortality inequality across counties rose 30 percent, accompanied by an increasing rural health penalty. Using county- and state-level data from the 1992–2019 period, we demonstrate that these three trends arose due to a fundamental shift in the geographic patterns of mortality among college and non-college populations. First, we find a sharp decline in both mortality rates and geographic inequality for college graduates. Second, the reverse was true for people without a college degree; spatial inequality became amplified. Third, we find that rates of smoking play a key role in explaining all three empirical puzzles, with secondary roles attributed to income, other health behaviors, and state policies. Less well-understood is why “place effects” matter so much for smoking (and mortality) for those without a college degree.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is income inequality in the United States primarily driven by disparities between ethnic groups or within them? The evidence reveals a striking pattern: 96% of U.S. income inequality arises from variation within groups sharing common ancestral origins, far overshadowing the comparatively small share attributable to differences between these groups. This pattern remains remarkably stable across time and regions.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Contemporaneous Air Pollution Exposure on Cognitive Performance in Kenya</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the short-term cognitive effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure using highly time-resolved, individual-level data collected during cognitive testing in Kenya. By linking real-time portable monitor readings to Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) scores, we identify acute impacts of pollution on general and domain-specific cognition. Higher PM2.5 exposure during testing is associated with lower cognitive performance, particularly in memory, executive function, and visuospatial tasks. Nonlinear models suggest threshold effects, with larger declines at higher exposure levels. Notably, effects are significantly larger among more educated individuals, possibly due to greater task demands or lower chronic exposure that limits physiological adaptation. Given that cognitive impairment is evident even at PM2.5 levels below Kenya’s annual regulatory threshold of 35 μg/m³, the findings suggest that short-term exposure may impose underappreciated human capital costs that current regulatory standards fail to mitigate. The results highlight the potential cognitive and economic returns to interventions that reduce air pollution exposures in low-resource settings.</content>

    <title>The Labor Market and Health Impacts of Reducing Cesarean Section Deliveries</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in three births in the United States is delivered by cesarean section (c-section). This paper studies the labor market and health effects of c-sections, using newly linked administrative data that combines the universe of California birth records with mothers’ quarterly earnings. We analyze the impact of an intervention that reduced c-section rates among low-risk first-time births, and find that mothers exposed to the intervention appear to have a higher likelihood of employment in the quarter following birth, as well as a higher likelihood of returning to their pre-birth employer. These impacts attenuate over time—suggesting that a c-section primarily delays return to the labor market following childbirth—but attachment to the pre-birth employer remains higher five quarters post-birth. We find no evidence of significant impacts on maternal or infant health, indicating that the intervention-induced decline in c-sections did not come at the cost of worse outcomes. Further, among mothers who have another child, we find that exposure to the intervention at the first birth leads to a lower likelihood of c-section and preterm delivery at the second one, implying that both the economic and health benefits of reduced c-sections may compound with birth order.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examined the heterogeneous impacts of social security reforms in Japan over the past 40 years. We utilize a nationwide large-scale micro-dataset to compute individual-level social security wealth (SSW) and mortality rates by lifetime earning groups. We found that SSW declined for all groups after the social security reforms, which aimed to reduce generosity; however, the size of the negative impact was larger for richer individuals. These results indicate that a series of recent social security reforms have reduced inequality in SSW.</content>

    <title>On Productivity and Distortions across Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the empirical properties of firm-level productivity and distortions across countries using the newly released World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES). Using a standard framework of production heterogeneity, I show that the gap in productivity and distortions between high and low productivity firms is larger in developing countries, generating large aggregate productivity losses from misallocation. A key empirical property of distortions in developing countries is that they systematically weaken the relationship between firm size and firm productivity. I exploit a unique feature of the WBES data to document which specific aspects of the economic environment faced by firms, such as financial constraints, regulation, corruption, and weak infrastructure, are consistent with the empirical pattern of distortions across countries.</content>

    <title>Antitrust Enforcement in Labor Markets</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Until recently, antitrust laws were rarely enforced in labor markets. Although the existence of labor market power has long been recognized, evidence only recently emerged that such market power regularly arises from sources that are actionable under antitrust law. Since 2010, antitrust agencies have substantially increased labor market enforcement actions. However, many questions relevant to enforcement remain unanswered, such as how to conduct market definition for labor markets, and how best to incorporate concentration into models of the labor market. This article reviews how antitrust is beginning to be used in labor markets, the evidence for and against its use, and the remaining evidence gaps standing in the way of more effective use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Joint custody following divorce is widespread, but implementation is costly when individuals live in different states and so affects interstate mobility. Migration of separated fathers has fallen significantly more than that of married fathers. We show the causal effect of joint custody using two strategies. First, we survey separated parents to elicit beliefs about the likelihood of interstate moves. Second, we use the staggered adoption of joint custody laws across US states, and show a reduction in actual migration of 11 percentage points for fathers. For mothers, there is no impact on mobility but suggestive evidence of beneficial labor market outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the years, the Belgian social security system has undergone substantial reform with a prime focus on increasing older worker labor force participation. The paper explores the effect of past reforms on inequality in old age.  We distinguish two separate effects: The mechanical effect considers the change in inequality and expected benefit levels due to the reforms for a fixed retirement age distribution. The behavioral effect accounts for the endogenous change caused by changes in the incentives to work. Our results show that mechanically, reforms have led to losses in expected benefits for all but the lowest income quintile. Behavioral changes had a positive but orders of magnitude smaller effect. Overall, inequality decreased as a result of reforms.</content>

    <title>Predictably Unpredictable Inspections</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inspections are a common tool for acquiring information and incentivizing compliance. Although inspections are typically unannounced, their timing often follows a predictable schedule. We study how this predictability shapes firm effort and patient outcomes in U.S. nursing homes, leveraging detailed administrative data on staffing, care, and health outcomes. Nursing homes "slack" in the low-risk period following an inspection and ramp up effort as their next inspection approaches. Patient survival mirrors this pattern, suggesting that these fluctuations in effort have meaningful consequences for the quality of patient care. We embed these estimates in a dynamic model capturing how inspection regimes incentivize effort and provide information about quality. Our estimates indicate that moving to unpredictable inspections could induce as much additional effort as increasing the frequency of inspections by 12%, while only minimally reducing their informational value.</content>

    <title>Medium-Term Impacts of Integrated Social Safety Nets: Cash Transfers, Information Meetings, and Home Visits for Child Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cash transfers are a critical part of social safety nets. However, integrated programs combining cash and parenting interventions through either group-based information meetings or home visits are recently being adopted to improve child development. Working with the Burkina Faso government, we conduct a randomized experiment in 225 rural villages to assess the impact of an integrated social safety net over the child’s life cycle. Villages were randomized to a control group or one of the following treatments: cash transfers; cash transfers plus government-run group-based information meetings focused on children’s health and psychosocial development; or cash transfers, information, and home visits reinforcing the information meetings. Fifteen months after treatment ended, households receiving cash, information, and home visits have fewer pregnancies, more medically assisted childbirths, enhanced health behaviors, and better educational outcomes. Adding home visits is essential for improving childhood development, while cash, with or without information, produces no lasting impacts.</content>

    <title>Examining the Effect of Cannabis Legalization on Youth Cannabis Use: Evidence on the Importance of Enforcing Retailer Compliance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies show that U.S. state cannabis legalization has increased adult cannabis use, but the effects on youth use are mixed. This study considers whether omission of enforcement of the minimum legal sales age (MLSA) might help explain prior mixed findings. We combine biennial survey data for 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students from the 2010-2023 Washington Healthy Youth Survey with administrative data on premise and compliance checks from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB). Premise checks educate retailers on any potential violations but do not involve penalties or fines. Compliance checks, on the other hand, involve increasing penalties imposed on retailers if they are found to be noncompliant with sales to minors. We use difference-in-differences (DID) methods that are robust to a staggered policy rollout with dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects and assess impacts of both types of inspections on past month cannabis use. We conduct a series of sensitivity and robustness checks of the impact of both types of inspections based on student’s grade, length of time since inspection, inclusion of alcohol/tobacco retail compliance checks, and alternative measures of cannabis use. Our research suggests that the implementation of regular random compliance checks with stiff penalties on retailers for noncompliance may help reduce the influence of legal markets on youth use. Unobserved heterogeneity within and across states in the enforcement of MLSAs may contribute to mixed findings of the impact of legalization on youth cannabis use.</content>

    <title>Electoral Margins and Political Competition</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Clemence Tricaud &amp; Romain Wacziarg</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we argue that recent trends in party seat margins and election vote margins result from structural changes in the nature of US political competition. We assemble a comprehensive database of electoral results for the House, Senate and presidential contests, from the 19th century until today. Seat margins declined in the recent period, so the margins of control of the House, Senate, and Electoral College by either party have become smaller. However, this was not accompanied by a decline in the margins of victory at the constituency level. We propose a model of electoral competition with multiple districts that can rationalize these trends. We show theoretically that an increase in politicians’ information about voter preferences, together with the growing nationalization of politics, can account for the decrease in seat margins and the concurrent stability in vote margins. As implied by the model, we document that campaign contributions received by House and Senate candidates are increasingly concentrated in a dwindling set of swing constituencies.</content>

    <title>The State Pension Age and Inequality in Old-age Social Security Wealth in the Netherlands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the early 2010s, the state pension age (SPA) is one of the main public policy instruments in the Netherlands for inducing people to postpone retirement. The SPA has gradually increased from 65 years in 2012 to 66 years and 4 months in 2021. In the context of the Dutch old-age social security system, an increase in the SPA is hypothesized to decrease the retirement probability and to increase inequality in pension benefits entitlements. Empirical support for the two hypotheses is found with data on individuals aged 55–69 over the period 2011-2021. Inequality in old-age social security wealth has increased after 2015 for non-retirees. However, the findings do not support that this increase is because of the SPA increase.</content>

    <title>Social Security Reforms and Inequality among Older Workers in Spain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter studies social security reforms and trends in inequalities among older workers over the last decades in Spain. Its main goal is to analyze the redistributive impact of the various pension reforms on older income inequality. Compared to the rules in 1985, recent pension reforms have led to an average increase on Social Security Wealth of approximately 18,000€ for men and 15,000€ for women. This represents a ten and eight percent increase, respectively. This effect is mostly driven by the mechanical or direct effect (e.g. via benefit adjustments), while changes in retirement probability (secondary or behavioral effect) are close to zero. Furthermore, we find striking differences across income quartiles, for both men and women. In both cases, there is a clear income gradient, where the richest quartile has benefitted the most with an increase close to twenty percent, or over €50,000, for both men and women. Conversely, the change for the poorest income quartile for men and the two poorest income quartiles for women is close to zero or even slightly negative. This is likely due to the effect of minimum benefits (that mark the generosity of the system, see Boldrin et al, 1999) that automatically absorb any other effect for low-income individuals.</content>

    <title>Pension Reforms and Inequalities in France</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study analyzes the distributional effects of French pension reforms from 1993 to 2014 across different socioeconomic groups. Using administrative data for individuals born between 1934 and 1950, we examine the impact on social security wealth (SSW) across lifetime earnings deciles and genders. Our methodology incorporates differential life expectancy and exploits the PENSIPP model for counterfactual scenarios. Results show that reforms generally decreased SSW across all income groups, with regressive tendencies. The 1993 reform had the most significant impact, reducing SSW by over 15% for men in the lowest earnings decile compared to 5% for the highest. Subsequent reforms had milder effects. These findings contribute to understanding the long-term consequences of pension reforms on inequality and inform future policy decisions in countries facing similar demographic challenges.</content>

    <title>Financializing the Professions: The Rise of Private Equity in Accounting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private equity (PE) has moved rapidly into professional services, yet its impact on accounting, where licensing regimes, reputational capital, and partnership governance traditionally limit external ownership, remains poorly understood. We examine how PE ownership alters the organization and market structure of accounting firms using data from 1999-2024 that link more than 3,600 PE transactions to detailed information on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), labor markets, and audit pricing. PE investment increases sharply after 2020 and extends to both CPA-licensed audit firms and non-CPA advisory practices, with most activity in large mid-tier PCAOB-registered firms. After PE entry, firms grow faster: non-audit revenues rise, employment expands, and cross-state M&amp;A accelerates, consistent with platform-building and consolidation. These adjustments have market-level implications. PE investment raises labor-market concentration in key accounting occupations and drives up ERISA audit fees in a standardized setting, as confirmed by a synthetic difference-in-differences design. Our results reveal a key tension at the core of professions: preserving independence and competition in a market increasingly driven by financial capital.</content>

    <title>Default and Interest Rate Shocks: Renegotiation Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a sovereign default model with debt renegotiation in which interest-rate shocks affect default incentives through two mechanisms. Under the standard mechanism, higher interest rates tighten the government’s budget constraint. Under the renegotiation mechanism, higher rates increase lenders’ opportunity cost of holding delinquent debt, which makes lenders accept larger haircuts and makes default more attractive for the government. We argue that our novel renegotiation mechanism reconciles standard sovereign default models with the narrative that the sharp increase in the real interest rate in the United States was a relevant factor in the defaults of the early 1980s.</content>

    <title>Long-run Effects of Universal Pre-Primary Education Expansion: Evidence from Argentina</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the long-run effects of a large public expansion of pre-primary education in Argentina. Between 1993 and 1999 the federal government financed the construction of new preschool classrooms targeted to departments with low base- line enrollment and high poverty, creating roughly 186,000 additional places. We link administrative records on classroom construction to four population censuses and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare treated and untreated cohorts across high- and low-construction departments. An additional preschool seat per child increases post-kindergarten schooling by about 0.5 years, raising the probability of completing secondary school by 11.9 percentage points and of enrolling in post-secondary education by 7.1 percentage points. For women, access to the program also reduces completed fertility: an additional seat lowers the number of live births per woman by 0.18, and we find no evidence that selective migration biases these estimates. We find little impact on labor-market outcomes at the census date, consistent with beneficiaries still being in school or in the early stages of their careers. A benefit-cost analysis based on the estimated schooling gains, standard Mincer returns, and observed construction and operating costs yields a benefit-cost ratio of about 11 and an internal rate of return of 13%. Our findings show that universal at-scale pre-primary expansions in middle-income countries can generate sizable improvements in human capital and demographic outcomes at relatively low fiscal cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper links globalization, worker efficiency, and wage inequality within plants to internal labor market organization. Using German plant-worker data and information on the task content of occupations, we document that larger plants (i) use more occupations, (ii) assign fewer tasks per occupation, and (iii) exhibit greater wage dispersion. We develop a model where plants endogenously bundle tasks into occupations, improving worker-task matching at the cost of higher fixed span-of-control costs. Embedding this into a Melitz framework, we show that trade increases worker efficiency and wage inequality in exporting plants, whereas non-exporting plants experience the opposite effects. Structural estimation and simulations confirm the model’s predictions and point to non-monotonic economy-wide effects.</content>

    <title>The Consequences of Abortion Funding Bans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do restrictions on public funding create unintended reliance on social assistance? In this paper, we study the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which barred federal funding for abortion. Using county-level data and an event-study design, we show that reduced federal funding for abortion increased fertility among young women by 2%. These effects were concentrated among non-white women, who subsequently experienced greater welfare participation in states with larger abortion funding declines. The consequences extend into the next generation: non-white girls born after Hyde were more likely to rely on public assistance in adulthood. Abortion funding restrictions reinforce long-run economic inequality across generations.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Online Sales Bans on E-Cigarette Use</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policymakers at the state and federal levels have argued that restricting online sales of e-cigarettes is a crucial policy tool to curb youth vaping. This study is the first to explore the effectiveness of statewide restrictions on online sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) on teen and young adult ENDS use. Using data from four national datasets (Monitoring the Future, State and Combined Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System surveys, Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey) and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find no evidence that such laws are effective at curbing youth ENDS use. With 95 percent confidence, we can rule out that online sales restrictions reduced prior-month ENDS use by more than 3.6 percent of the pre-treatment mean vaping rate. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that (1) while restrictions on online sales may have a small negative effect on online purchases, youths are able to substitute to other sources for ENDS products to compensate for reduced online access, and (2) online sources are a very rare source of e-cigarettes for youths. Finally, we also find no evidence that online sales restrictions reduce adult ENDS use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a large-scale information randomized controlled trial to study fiscal policy impacts. Surveying approximately 9,000 households across five eurozone countries with varying debt-to-GDP ratios enables a clean cross-country comparison. The key finding is that the fiscal multiplier depends jointly on the financing method and the country’s debt burden: multipliers are smaller in high-debt countries when debt-financed but remain similar across countries when tax-financed. Finally, we develop a New Keynesian model featuring fiscal discipline, which reproduces the empirical patterns observed in the survey and highlights their underlying economic mechanisms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Export activity shapes workers’ experience-wage profiles. Using employer-employee and customs data for Brazilian manufacturing, we document that workers' experience wage profiles are steeper at exporters than at non-exporters and, among exporters, steeper at exporters shipping to high-income destinations. We develop and quantify a model featuring worker-firm wage bargaining, export-market entry by multi-worker firms, and human capital accumulation by workers to interpret the data. Human capital growth can explain one-half of the differences in wage profiles between exporters and non-exporters. We show that increased human capital per worker can account for one-half of the overall gains in real income from trade openness.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Dynamic Prices on Electric Vehicle Public Charging Demand: Evidence from a Nationwide Natural Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding how to effectively influence electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior is critical for managing electricity grids powered by high levels of variable renewable generation. We present results from a large-scale natural field experiment conducted in the United Kingdom, involving approximately 110,000 EV customers and 60% of the country’s public charging infrastructure. Within this network, we applied a price decrease to approximately one-fifth of chargers to bring their prices closer to the marginal cost of electricity in low-cost hours in Great Britain. Customers were randomly assigned to different price levels, allowing us to estimate the causal effect of price on charging demand and derive elasticities of short-run behavioral responses. Customers were highly responsive to price: a 40% reduction in charging costs increased platform-wide charging activity by 117%, while a 15% price cut led to a 30% increase. Decomposing the increase in charging, we estimate that approximately half reflected substitution between charging apps. Our findings suggest that dynamic pricing for public EV charging generated large consumer welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Worker Preparedness Across the Marshallian Runs Survey Instruments and Early Evidence from the Copenhagen Life Panel</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Worker preparedness is a missing transmission channel in macroeconomics. Alfred Marshall’s taxonomy of short-, medium-, and long-run adjustment was developed to analyse how firms respond to shocks when different inputs can or cannot adjust. We extend this logic to workers by adding an element Marshall’s framework leaves implicit: anticipation. Preparedness refers to the buffers, search strategies, fallback plans, and retraining intentions individuals form before disruption occurs. These forward-looking margins shape both microeconomic outcomes and the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy.
The registry-linked Copenhagen Life Panel (CLP) provides a data architecture for making preparedness observable. By embedding belief and strategy elicitation within administrative records, the CLP makes it possible to test whether workers’ expectations and contingency plans are calibrated to the risks they face. Early evidence shows that short-run preparedness—liquidity, earnings-risk beliefs, and separation expectations—is measurable and predictive, and that miscalibration is a key source of vulnerability.
The broader agenda is to measure preparedness across Marshallian runs and across the worker life cycle. In the medium run, adjustment depends on search strategies and fallback planning; in the long run, retraining and occupational reorientation determine whether technological disruption becomes renewal or decline. We outline survey instruments for each run that can be integrated with registry data, transforming preparedness from conjecture into measurable and model-ready constructs.</content>

    <title>Sources of Evidence for Evidence-based Policymaking: Journals, Articles and Scholarly Structures in the Economic Report of the President 2010-2025</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does academic research inform presidential economic policy? This paper investigates the sources of evidence in the Economic Report of the President from 2010 to 2025. We construct a novel dataset of 4,140 unique references cited across the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations to map the evidence base used by the Council of Economic Advisers. Our analysis shows that peer-reviewed articles, comprising 66.62% of all these references, are heavily concentrated in top-tier economics journals. While the specific articles cited change with policy priorities, the hierarchy of journals remains moderately stable across years and administrations. A co-author network analysis reveals a scholarly landscape of distinct intellectual camps. Crucially, a small number of high-centrality scholars act as brokers, connecting these disparate research communities. Together, our findings illuminate the social structure of evidence-based policymaking, demonstrating how journal hierarchies and scholarly networks shape the flow of economic knowledge to the White House.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Survey mode is a critical consideration in well-being research using the 22 country Global Flourishing Study (GFS).  We find marked differences in responses to well-being questions if they are obtained via a telephone interviewer (CATI) or online (CAWI).  In fifteen countries in the GFS both survey modes are used.  In seven of the most advanced countries, only CAWI is used.  Well-being responses are markedly different across survey modes within countries using both modes and compared to countries only using CAWI.  On average, CATI tends to produce higher well-being scores.  Failure to account for these sampling differences biases results.  This is the case in twenty-three prior studies that used the GFS and took no account of survey mode.  We examine each of these studies and show the findings differ by survey mode.  Combined with the presence of other unobservable country-level confounders, the differences between survey modes substantively weakens the internal validity of cross-country comparisons and random effects meta-analysis conducted with the GFS.</content>

    <title>Volatile Rates, Fragile Growth: Global Financial Risk and Productivity Dynamics</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that rising volatility in U.S. interest rates, a key dimension of global financial risk, notably depresses the trend of economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs) but not in advanced economies (AEs). Using a panel state-space model, we show that a one standard- deviation shock to U.S. monetary policy uncertainty permanently lowers the level of GDP in EMEs by about 25 basis points after three years, with negligible effects in AEs. We rationalize this fact in a small open economy model where firms borrow against future profits to finance innovation. Higher volatility compresses firm values, tightens collateral constraints, and endogenously slows productivity growth, especially when financial frictions are severe.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The variety of financial products available for firms to raise funds has expanded rapidly in recent decades. This paper studies the role of innovations that introduce specialized financial products using a combination of granular data and a parsimonious model of security issuance. We present three key findings. First, differential product adoption across firms explains most of the observed variation in the amounts of funds raised. Second, firms that adopt new products are more successful in raising funds. Third, the funds raised from new financial products are often sourced from numerous highly specialized products, each used by only a few firms.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We match patents to products using natural language methods applied to detailed product descriptions and patent texts in the consumer goods sector. While more than half of product innovations originate from non-patenting firms, patent filings are on average followed by subsequent product introductions. Yet this relationship weakens with firm size. Patents held by market leaders also yield revenue premiums beyond what can be explained by their own product introductions and are associated with stronger deterrence of competitors’ innovations. To interpret these findings, we develop a simple growth model in which larger firms have stronger incentives to engage in strategic patenting—filing for protection rather than market innovation—which dampens innovation and slows creative destruction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In sorting literature, comparative statics for multidimensional assignment models with general output functions and input distributions is an important open question. We provide a complete theory of comparative statics for technological change in general multidimensional assignment models. Our main result is that any technological change is uniquely decomposed into two distinct components. The first component (gradient) gives a characterization of changes in marginal earnings through a Poisson equation. The second component (divergence-free) gives a characterization of labor reallocation. For U.S. data, we quantify equilibrium responses in sorting and earnings with respect to cognitive skill-biased technological change.</content>

    <title>Identity and Ideology in the School Boardroom</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School boards have statutory authority over most elementary and secondary education policies, but receive little attention compared to other actors in education systems. A fundamental challenge to understanding the importance of boards is the absence of data on the policy goals of board members—i.e., their ideologies—forcing researchers to conduct tests based on demographic and professional characteristics—i.e., identities—with which ideology is presumed to correlate. This paper uses new data on the viewpoints and policy actions of school board members, coupled with a regression discontinuity design that generates quasi-random variation in board composition, to establish two results. The first is that the priorities of board members have large causal effects across many domains. For example, the effect of electing an equity-focused board member on test scores for low-income students is roughly equivalent to assigning every such student a teacher who is 0.3 to 0.4 SDs higher in the distribution of teacher value-added. The second is that observing policy priorities is crucial. Identity turns out to be a poor proxy for ideology, with limited governance effects that are fully explained by differences in policy priorities. Our findings challenge the belief that school boards are unimportant, showing that who serves on the board and what they prioritize can have far-reaching consequences for students.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Opportunity Zone program was designed to encourage investment in distressed communities across the United States. Early research found no evidence of impacts of the program on employment, earnings, or poverty of zone residents, but some evidence of positive effects on employment among businesses in zones. Using the latest survey-based as well as administrative data, we adopt a longer-run and more comprehensive perspective on the labor market impacts of OZs. We find that OZ designation increases job creation among businesses within zones. However, a large share of the newly created jobs in zones is offset by declines in nearby low-income communities. While we detect gains in OZ resident employment over the longer run, the increase comes from jobs with workplaces outside of OZs that, in light of the changing demographic composition of zones, are likely held by new as opposed to existing residents. Overall, our results suggest that OZs have limited benefits for existing residents of targeted areas and are associated mainly with a spatial reallocation of jobs and households.</content>

    <title>How Good is International Risk Sharing? Stepping Outside the Shadow of the Welfare Theorems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit whether global output is (Pareto) efficiently distributed across countries over time. The efficient allocation of goods across regions requires that the relative marginal utilities of consumption across countries comoves with the relative costs of the country-specific consumption bundles.  Standard approaches to evaluating this property exploit the Welfare Theorems and equate the observed real exchange rate with the social relative costs of consumption.  Given the large literature documenting the disconnect between exchange rates, relative prices faced by consumers in a given market, and relative quantities consumed, we develop a methodology that measures relative costs that is robust to this disconnect.  We find that relative consumption growth across regions is significantly more correlated with our computed shadow prices than it is with observed real exchange rates, suggesting an allocation closer to efficient risk sharing.  Moreover, we provide a decentralization that matches observed prices and quantities, enabling us to rationalize the better implied risk sharing with the failure of the standard correlations.  The decentralization involves a combination of segmented foreign exchange markets and pricing-to-market behavior in goods markets.  The model implies that consumption allocations are insulated from excess fluctuations in the exchange rate via the equilibrium pricing behavior of exporters.</content>

    <title>The Cost of State-Building: Evidence from Germany</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the potential of pro-development state (capacity) building projects to be coopted for repression. I leverage the natural experiment created by the differential build-up of capacity between formerly Prussian and formerly non-Prussian parts of unified Germany, and the radical policy shifts instigated by the Nazi regime. Across a geographical discontinuity, and across different stops of the same train transport to the East, I find that Prussian municipalities were significantly more efficient at deporting Germany's Jews. They were also better at providing public goods and at collecting taxes. Just before the Nazis came to power, Prussian municipalities also provided public goods more efficiently, but were not differentially involved with anti-Semitism. I show that democratic oversight and aspects of bureaucratic culture can mitigate the potential for future abuse of state building projects.</content>

    <title>Elections and Political Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Elections select officeholders and policies, but they also signal to political actors where to invest their time and money. This paper presents a framework for understanding these effects, in which political investors (e.g., donors, activists) allocate resources where expected political fundamentals favor their party. Investors possess idiosyncratic local knowledge but also public information in the form of recent election results. These signals are complementary: where local knowledge is good, even the narrowest vote-share majorities can align beliefs and concentrate investment. I apply this framework to the changing political geography of the United States between 1940 and 1972, when urban and minority areas came into play for the Democratic Party. A regression discontinuity design based on close presidential elections shows that counties narrowly won by Democrats saw pronounced increases in Democratic local officeholding and voter support in subsequent election periods. This does not reflect direct impacts of presidential elections on local offices, but rather indirect shifts through political investment, including heightened activity in newspaper advertising, phone banking, and civil rights mobilization. Effects are concentrated in urban, Black, and union areas where dense organizational networks enhanced local political knowledge. Together, the findings show how elections organize political actors not only at the ballot box but through the information they convey.</content>

    <title>Learning and the Emergence of Nonlinearity in Financial Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial markets (and more generally the real economy) display a wide range of important nonlinearities. This paper focuses on stock returns, which are skewed
left – generating crashes – and whose volatility moves over time, is itself skewed, is strongly related to the level of prices, and displays long memory. This paper shows that such behavior is almost inevitable when prices are formed by investors acquiring information about the true, but latent, value of stocks. It studies a general model of filtering in which agents receive signals about the fundamental value of the stock market and dynamically update their beliefs (potentially with biases). When those beliefs are non-normal and investors believe crashes can happen, prices generically display the range of nonlinearities observed in the data. While the model does not explain where crashes come from, it shows that investors believing that prices can crash is sufficient to generate the rich higher-order dynamics observed empirically. In a simple calibration with iid shocks to fundamentals, the model fits well quantitatively, and regression-based tests support the model’s mechanism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study poverty minimization via direct transfers, framing this as a statistical learning problem while retaining the information constraints faced by real-world programs. Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world’s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income. Extrapolated globally, the results correspond to a cost of (approximately) ending extreme poverty of roughly 0.3% of global GDP.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We offer guidance and tools for augmenting macroeconomic models with a realistic friction in expectations and for quantifying its implications. We start by distilling the common essence of a few popular alternatives to FIRE (Full Information Rational Expectations), including noisy or sticky information, rational or behavioral inattention, level-k thinking and cognitive discounting. We then develop a new specification, which captures the same essence while maximizing tractability. We show how this works in both RANK (the Representative-Agent New Keynesian model) and HANK (Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models). We further clarify the separate partial- and general-equilibrium effects of informational frictions or bounded rationality; emphasize the interaction of such frictions with the Intertemporal Keynesian Cross and other forms of strategic complementarity; review concrete lessons for business cycles and macroeconomic policy; and discuss how to discipline the theory with appropriate survey evidence.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that in long-term consumer–producer relationships, menus of contracts can often be advantageously replaced by a single generous contract such that, at any point in time, a consumer’s cumulative transfers equal the cumulative transfers they would have made under the contract that would have been best for them in hindsight. Such generous long-term contracts can increase skeptical consumers’ demand for complex and higher-powered contracts while approximately implementing the same outcomes as the underlying menu evaluated by a rational decision maker. Applications include voluntary load shedding in retail electricity markets and cost sharing in health insurance.</content>

    <title>Rebuilding Ukraine's Cities: Maximizing Benefits and Minimizing Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper discusses the rebuilding of Ukrainian cities. We start by outlining key facts about Ukraine and its cities: (i) the country’s population is declining; (ii) there is a shift in demand for housing from east to west; (iii) Kyiv’s advantage is growing; (iv) house prices are rising in Kyiv and western cities, (v) Ukraine’s cities are slow and congested. We then present a theoretical framework for maximizing the benefits of Ukraine’s rebuilding effort to highlight the welfare effects of different allocations of post-war infrastructure. Finally, we consider the cost curve for reconstruction, as determined, in particular, by the cost of materials, labor, the industrial organization of the building industry and public practices in procurement and regulation. We highlight three broad strategies for shifting the cost curve: openness, standardization and investing-in-investing. We conclude by outlining areas for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What explains the dramatic differences in earnings across locations? We employ an administrative employer-employee linked dataset from Italy that includes the country’s entire workforce to estimate firm-worker or location-worker effects. We also estimate differences in human capital accumulation across firms and cities. We find that the elasticity of the location premia to density is smaller than in other settings and that other locational characteristics, such as segregation in school or the workplace and inter-generational mobility, are more strongly correlated with earnings and earnings growth. Our place-based estimates are similar if we focus on movers who were forced to relocate after the L’Aquila Earthquake. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that density levels jump up at the historic border between House of Savoy-ruled Piedmont and the Hapsburg Empire. Earnings today also jump at the border. This finding suggests that there may be some unintended effects of being a far-flung province of a distant empire, perhaps because of access to larger markets or the administrative and educational reforms that began under Empress Maria Theresa.</content>

    <title>Who Chooses and Who Benefits? The Design of Public School Choice Systems</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public school choice has evolved rapidly in the past two decades, as districts roll out new magnet, dual-language, and themed programs to broaden educational opportunity. We use newly collected national data to document that opt-in (voluntary) systems: (i) are the modal design; (ii) are harder to navigate; and (iii) have participation that is concentrated among more advantaged students. These facts suggest a striking inconsistency: districts have largely adopted centralized assignment algorithms to broaden access, but most rely on optional participation that fragments public education. We study the implications of this design choice in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest opt-in system in the country, combining nearly two decades of administrative data, randomized lotteries, and quasi-experimental expansions in access. Participation is highly selective, consistent with national evidence, and lottery estimates suggest that the students with the lowest demand for choice schools are the ones who gain the most from attending. Opt-in participation therefore embeds a selection mechanism that screens out high-return students and leaves many effective programs with unused capacity. To evaluate system-level implications, we estimate a structural model linking applications, enrollment, and achievement. Choice schools are vertically differentiated and generate meaningful gains, but the opt-in participation rule—through high application costs and negative selection on gains—prevents these benefits from reaching the students who need them most. Counterfactual simulations make the design stakes clear: information and travel-cost reductions have limited effects, whereas reforms that change the participation architecture eliminate core inefficiencies and deliver the largest district-wide achievement gains. These results underscore that system design— not school effectiveness alone—shapes who benefits from public school choice and to what extent.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian literature has revisited the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy to consumption using models where heterogeneous households face idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints. We show that the key lessons from this literature also apply to investment using a model where heterogeneous firms face idiosyncratic productivity risk and financial frictions: constrained firms’ investment depends on their free cash flow, generating indirect effects of monetary policy and implying that transfer payments stimulate investment demand. Quantitatively, the strength of these new mechanisms is governed by firms’ marginal propensities to invest (MPIs), similar to the role of marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) for households. But unlike MPCs, we currently lack quasi-experimental evidence about MPIs that we can use to directly discipline the new mechanisms.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Spousal Social Security Claiming Decisions on the Financial Shock of Widowhood</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents evidence suggesting that delayed Social Security claiming by husbands – resulting in an actuarially enhanced benefit – attenuates the financial shock of widowhood for their wives. Under Social Security survivor benefit rules, primary earners (usually husbands) pass on the actuarial adjustments from delayed claiming to their surviving spouses. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, I find women whose husbands delayed claiming to full retirement age or later face a post-widowhood increase of 6.9 percentage points in the probability of falling below the 5th percentile of the pre-widowhood income distribution. This effect is almost 12 percent smaller for each year of delayed claiming by the husband (though the attenuation is concentrated in the first 4 years of widowhood). The general findings are robust to instrumenting for the husband’s claiming age using the loosening of the retirement earnings test in 2000 – a policy change that incentivized earlier claiming.</content>

We estimate a commute mode choice model to value commute time savings in the short run and a housing choice model to value the improved commuting utility that households experience due to spatial sorting. Aggregate benefits from Metro rail are over 10 times higher when spatial sorting occurs. In the short run women, college-educated workers, and workers with above median incomes experience higher benefits than their opposites. In the long run, households with lower incomes and assets and less than college education benefit more than their wealthier counterparts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the introduction of the first antibiotic therapies in 1937 to examine the long-run effects of early-childhood pneumonia on adult educational attainment, employment, income, and work-related disability. Using census data, we document large average improvements across all outcomes, alongside substantial heterogeneity by gender and race. Among women, health gains led to changes in marriage and fertility that partially offset their labor market improvements. Among Black Americans, we uncover a pronounced gradient linked to systemic racial discrimination in the pre–Civil Rights era: individuals born in more discriminatory Jim Crow states realized much smaller gains than those born in less discriminatory states, despite larger reductions in pneumonia exposure. There is no similar gradient among white Americans. Together, these findings highlight the central role of institutional environments in shaping whether investments in early-life health translate into long-run socioeconomic gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine women's household power in low- and middle-income countries, synthesizing theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence on its measurement, determinants, and consequences. We define women's household power as their influence over household choices, distinguishing it from broader empowerment concepts. We review economic models, including unitary, collective, and bargaining frameworks, and map these to empirical approaches. We then discuss measurement methods  such as structural estimation of consumption allocation, survey measures, and laboratory experiments. On the determinants of women's power, we find that some approaches, such as transfers targeted to women, show mixed results, while others, such as increasing women's control over their earnings, show clearer positive impacts. On the effects of women's power, we pay special attention to children's human capital. Few studies provide strong evidence that mothers invest more in children than fathers do, but collectively the evidence suggests such an effect. We conclude by highlighting research and methodological gaps.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how production networks shape the severity of Sudden Stops. We build a small open economy model with collateral constraints and input–output linkages, derive a sufficient statistic that maps network structure into the amplification of tradable shocks, and show that a planner optimally introduces sectoral wedges to reduce amplification. Using OECD input–output data and Sudden Stop episodes, we document systematic network differences between emerging and advanced economies and show they predict crisis severity. A calibrated three-sector DSGE model disciplined by these differences reveals that endowing an advanced economy with an emerging-market production network moves most of the way toward the observed emerging–advanced Sudden Stop gap.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study examines the quasi-natural experiments provided by the staggered introduction of open drivers in the supply chains for routers. It is rare to observe components become open and measure whether openness generates a statistical impact on more products and innovative products. This study collects novel data on all routers and subcomponents introduced between 2000 and 2018, characterizing each firm's position in a supply chain as either an upstream component provider or a downstream router assembler. Following prior literature, openness influences a firm's ability to negotiate with current and potential partners, which is labeled as autonomy. Evidence suggests that openness enhances supplier autonomy, increases the introduction of new products, and leads to a greater number of products located closer to the technical frontier. These estimates suggest that openness increased product introductions by enlarging the options available to component suppliers. The largest component suppliers benefited from greater sales, and no evidence indicates that openness aided entrants, small firms, or assemblers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter examines the economics of climate innovation and its role in the clean technology transition. It outlines the incentives, market failures, and policy levers that shape the development and diffusion of clean technologies; traces global patterns in technology development and deployment; and highlights frontier challenges and open questions related to climate adaptation, critical mineral supply chains, artificial intelligence, and geopolitics. The analysis explores the role of effective climate policy, stressing the relevance of coordinated approaches that match instruments to technology maturity and local context.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital is central to efforts to promote growth, convergence, and the elimination of poverty. Drawing on the seminal macroeconomic frameworks by Nelson-Phelps, Lucas and subsequent developments, alongside macro and microeconomic evidence, we examine the role of human capital in driving innovation and growth. We highlight how different types of human capital, characterized by education level, matter in different stages of development. Despite documented increases in years of schooling, the world’s poorest regions still see stagnating outcomes in learning and education quality, potentially creating poverty traps where investments in neither physical nor human capital materialize. We discuss obstacles to human capital accumulation through a simple analytical framework and present evidence from randomized interventions spanning early childhood programs to school-age initiatives, assessing policies that can effectively remove barriers to skill acquisition and establish foundations for sustained growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document six facts about the structure and dynamics of the LLM market using API usage data from OpenRouter and Microsoft Azure. First, we show rapid growth in the number of models, creators, and inference providers, driven by open-source entrants. Second, we show price declines and persistent price heterogeneity across and within intelligence tiers, with open-source models being 90% cheaper than comparable closed-source models of the same intelligence. Third, we document market dynamism, with frequent turnover among leading models and creators. Fourth, we present evidence of horizontal and vertical differentiation, with no single model dominating across use cases, and demand for intelligence varying widely across applications. Fifth, we estimate preliminary short-run price elasticities just above one, suggesting limited scope for Jevons-Paradox effects. Finally, we show that although the share of firms that use multiple models increased over time, most firms concentrate their use on a single model, consistent with experimentation rather than persistent reliance on multiple models.</content>

    <title>Entry and Exit in Treasury Auctions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hedge funds have become increasingly active in Treasury markets, yet we have little  evidence on how this shift has affected the market. We focus on the primary market, where the government issues its debt through auctions. Using over 20 years of  data from Canadian Treasury auctions, we document dealers exiting and hedge funds entering. To evaluate the costs and benefits of this trend for debt issuance, we develop an auction framework with endogenous participation. We find that the expected gains from greater hedge fund participation, driven by increased competition, are smaller than the costs that arise because hedge funds—unlike dealers—do not participate regularly. Currently, dealer participation remains sufficiently strong that policies aimed at stabilizing  participation have little effect on funding costs.</content>

    <title>Ruling for the Rich: the Supreme Court over Time</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To investigate the emergence of a pro-wealthy bias in the US Supreme Court, we develop a protocol to identify and analyze all cases involving economic issues from 1953 to the present. We categorize the parties in these cases as “rich” or “poor” according to their likelihood of being wealthy. A vote is pro-rich if that outcome would directly shift resources to the party that is more likely to be wealthy. Using this dataset, we estimate case-specific intercepts, justice-specific latent ideal points, and party-level time trends using the Bayesian methods pioneered by Martin and Quinn (2002). In the 1950s, justices appointed by the two parties appear similar in their propensity to cast pro-rich votes. Over the sample period, we estimate a steady increase in polarization, culminating in an implied party gap of 47 percentage points by 2022. The magnitude of the gap suggests the usefulness of an economic metric for prediction relative to ideologies such as originalism or textualism.</content>

    <title>From Treatment to Safety: The Role of Substance Use Treatment in Preventing Intimate Partner Violence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substance use is a well-established driver of intimate partner violence (IPV), with drug-related incidents posing persistent challenges for both public health and criminal justice systems. We examine how expanding access to substance use treatment (SUT) services affects IPV in the United States by leveraging variation in the opening and closing of treatment facilities at the county level. Using administrative data on IPV incidents from the National Incident-Based Reporting System at the agency level from 1998 to 2019 combined with county-level records on treatment facility information, we implement a continuous difference-in-differences research design. Our results show that adding three SUT facilities—the average annual increase per county over the sample period—reduces drug-involved IPV by about 1.5–1.7 percent. We find no evidence of significant effects on alcohol-related or non-substance-related IPV. Staggered event-study analyses confirm parallel outcome trends, across treated and non-treated counties, prior to net facility openings and lend support to a causal interpretation of the estimates. Related evidence from SUT admissions drawn from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) shows that new centers significantly raise treatment entry, particularly among men, consistent with reduced perpetration driving the observed decline in IPV exposure. Our findings highlight the role of health services infrastructure in shaping violence-related outcomes and underscore the broader public safety benefits of investment in treatment access.</content>

    <title>Valuing Sticky Deposits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a formal fixed-income framework to value sticky deposits. This framework provides closed-form expressions for deposit values and allows us to study the impact of stickiness on deposit interest-rate and runoff risks. The duration of a bank deposit can be either positive or negative, which has important implications for hedging the interest-rate risk of bank balance sheets. Banks that maximize deposit value by following optimal deposit beta strategies may significantly increase their interest-rate and deposit runoff risks. We test the empirical implications of the valuation model using market deposit premia observed in bank merger/acquisition transactions. The results provide strong empirical support for the model’s predictions.</content>

    <title>Tariff War Shock and the Convenience Yield of US Treasuries — A Hedging Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explain how the “Tariff War” shock of April 2025 affected the safe-asset status of US Treasuries. Convenience yield erosion for long bonds is consistent with a reduction in the hedging property, reflected in a rising stock-bond covariance. Decomposing the Treasury yield into risk-free rate, credit spread, and convenience yield components reveals that covariance due to the convenience yield component increased for long bonds. The short end of the Treasury curve, however, continued to exhibit the safe-asset hedging property. These effects are consistent with a withdrawal of safe-asset investors from long-term Treasuries and a rotation towards shorter-term Treasuries and gold.</content>

    <title>Fiscal Inaction as Monetary Support</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the fiscal framework affect the central bank's ability to stabilize output and inflation? The textbook answer, which assumes Ricardian households, recommends that fiscal adjustment should be fast enough to allow for monetary dominance. We instead argue that, with non-Ricardian households, the central bank may indeed welcome slow, or even no, fiscal adjustment. On the demand side, slow fiscal adjustment helps stabilize aggregate spending; on the supply side, it eases tax distortions, improving the output-inflation trade off. And while the first channel favors slow fiscal adjustment only when the business cycle is dominated by demand shocks, the second channel extends this preference to supply shocks. A quantitative exercise affirms our lessons in the U.S. context, with the central bank preferring virtually no fiscal adjustment over the business cycle.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how digital incentives influence survey participation and engagement in a large randomized controlled trial of parents across seven Texas school districts. We test how incentive amount and information about vendor options affect response behavior and explore differences by language background. Incentivized parents were more likely to start and complete surveys and claim gift cards, though Spanish-speaking parents exhibited distinct patterns—greater completion rates but lower redemption rates, often selecting essential-goods vendors. Increasing incentive value and providing advance information both improved engagement. Findings inform the design of equitable, effective digital incentive strategies for diverse populations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial behavior plays a role in many economic contexts, and it has been explained by altruism, social pressure, signaling, and expectations of fairness and reciprocity. We examine prosocial behavior in a context that allows us to distinguish the role of self-signaling and social signaling from alternative explanations, including warm glow. Our context is residential solar, and  self-signaling is separately identified from social signaling by the exogenous visibility of potential solar arrays. We show that the political affiliation of proximate peers influences the extent of self-signaling and is crowded out by the private benefits of installing solar.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test for and measure green waste: the misallocation of public subsidies for green investment projects. Our context is a major Norwegian program for green investment subsidies. We develop a model of subsidy allocation and apply it to detailed project-level data on carbon emissions and subsidy amounts for both marginal and inframarginal projects. We find that decision-makers could have achieved the same level of emission reductions at less than half the cost. To isolate the sources of this green waste, we use data on both ex-ante expected and ex-post realized emission reductions for each project. We find that decision-makers are able ex-ante to identify the projects with the highest ex-post emission reductions but unwilling to select them.</content>

    <title>Bayesian Inference in IV Regressions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well known that standard frequentist inference breaks down in IV regressions with weak instruments. Bayesian inference with diffuse priors suffers from the same problem. We show that the issue arises because flat priors on the first-stage coefficients overstate instrument strength. In contrast, inference improves drastically when an uninformative prior is specified directly on the concentration parameter—the key nuisance parameter capturing instrument relevance. The resulting Bayesian credible intervals are asymptotically equivalent to the frequentist confidence intervals based on conditioning approaches, and remain robust to weak instruments.</content>

    <title>The Morality of Market Exchanges: Between Societal Values and Tradeoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Certain behaviors in markets are unambiguously unethical. In other cases, however, voluntary exchanges that can create gains from trade remain contested on moral grounds, because of what is traded or of the price at which the exchange occurs. This chapter offers a framework to analyze these contested markets and provides examples of two general instances. First, we examine “repugnant” transactions involving the human body—such as compensated organ donation and gestational surrogacy—where concerns about dignity, exploitation, and inequality conflict with welfare gains from expanding supply. Second, we study price gouging in emergencies, where demands for a “just price” clash with the incentive and allocation roles of price adjustments under scarcity. Across both cases, we synthesize evidence on societal attitudes and highlight how support for policy options depends on perceived trade-offs between autonomy, fairness and efficiency, and on institutional features that can separate compensation from allocation.</content>

    <title>O-Ring Automation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study automation when tasks are quality complements rather than separable. Production requires numerous tasks whose qualities multiply as in an O-ring technology. A worker allocates a fixed endowment of time across the tasks performed; machines can replace tasks with given quality, and time is allocated across the remaining manual tasks. This “focus” mechanism generates three results. First, task-by-task substitution logic is incomplete because automating one task changes the return to automating others. Second, automation decisions are discrete and can require bundled adoption even when automation quality improves smoothly. Third, labour income can rise under partial automation because automation scales the value of remaining bottleneck tasks. These results imply that widely-used exposure indices, which aggregate task-level automation risk using linear formulas, will overstate displacement when tasks are complements. The relevant object is not average task exposure but the structure of bottlenecks and how automation reshapes worker time around them.</content>

    <title>Biases in Belief Updating Within and Across Domains</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do people sometimes overreact to new information and other times underreact? We develop a model in which the strength of a signal—how much one should update their beliefs with new information—depends on multiple features of the information environment. Limited attention to these features leads to misperceptions of signal strength: people approach a problem with an experience-based prior, which they adjust only partially based on how much attention they pay to different features. This mechanism explains a wide range of belief-updating patterns. Insensitivity to a single feature generates underreaction to strong and overreaction to weak signals, and more neglected features amplify this. Insensitivity to multiple features can instead break that pattern: insensitivity to one feature can generate excess sensitivity with respect to another, leading to overreaction to both weak and strong signals. A series of experiments provides support for the model and its underlying mechanism.</content>

    <title>Making Entrepreneurs: Long Term Returns to Training Youth in Business Skills</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the medium and long term impacts of Skills for Effective Entrepreneurship Development (SEED), a 3-week entrepreneurship training program for secondary school students in Uganda. The mini-MBA, modeled after business school curricula, was implemented as a randomized field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 4,402 youth. After four years, the training improved both hard and soft skills. SEED graduates became more effective negotiators and communicators and exhibited improved self-efficacy, stability, plasticity, and stress management. In the medium run, treated youth were more likely to start enterprises and more successful in ensuring their survival, thereby gaining greater entrepreneurial experience. Their ventures were also of higher quality: more likely to be formal, have employees, be in collaboration with other entrepreneurs, and use effective business management practices. With 52% of the sample still enrolled in post-secondary education, we find suggestive evidence that businesses led by the treatment groups performed better. After nine years, business ownership converged between treatment and control groups as control ownership rates doubled. However, SEED graduates maintained their edge in terms of business quality and operated firms with 20% higher revenues and 16% higher profits, without corresponding increases in capital or labor inputs, consistent with higher total factor productivity. Entrepreneurial success was achieved through the adoption of better business practices and experimentation, with soft skills related to entrepreneurial mindset playing a complementary role. SEED generated high returns on investment: the present discounted values of SEED-induced business and total earnings equal 20 and 27 times program costs, respectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study dynamic visual representations as a proxy for investor sentiment about the stock market. Our sentiment index, GIFsentiment, is constructed from millions of posts in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) on a leading investment social media platform. GIFsentiment correlates with seasonal mood variations and the severity of COVID lockdowns. It is positively associated with contemporaneous market returns and negatively predicts returns for up to four weeks, even after controlling for other sentiment and attention measures. These effects are stronger among portfolios that are more susceptible to mispricing. GIFsentiment positively predicts trading volume, market volatility, and flows toward equity funds and away from debt funds. Our evidence suggests that GIFsentiment is a proxy for misperceptions that are later corrected.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how traders' equity capitalization influences asset prices in a framework that accounts for market power. In our model, traders with capital constraints engage in transactions in an imperfectly competitive market. We demonstrate that looser capital constraints elevate both asset prices and price impact, the latter diminishing market liquidity. Using Canadian Treasury auction data, we illustrate how to apply our model to quantify these effects. We estimate the shadow costs of capital constraints by leveraging a temporary policy exemption during 2020-2021. We show that while these constraints are only infrequently binding, their relative impact when activated can be sizable.</content>

In contrast, mental health care use increases substantially, driven by daughters, beginning five years before a parent’s dementia-related death, peaking around the time of death, and converging to the counterfactual trend over seven years. Results suggest that robust long-term care policy can largely insulate adult children economically from parental dementia, but mental health spillovers persist, spurring nearly a decade of elevated use.</content>

    <title>The Incredible Shrinking Instruments: Using Empirical Bayes to Increase Efficiency in IV Designs with Many Instruments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In instrumental variables (IV) estimation with many instruments, such as judge fixed effects designs, the precision of the jackknife-estimated first stage can vary widely across observations.  When such variability exists, we show that the precision of JIVE second-stage estimates is meaningfully improved by shrinking judge propensities towards their conditional means, where the shrinkage factor depends on the precision of the first-stage fitted value.  Doing so requires no further assumptions and identifies the same local average treatment effect as the usual (unshrunken) JIVE estimator. We illustrate the precision gains from using a Shrunken JIVE estimator (SJIVE) in an application from the literature studying pre-trial detention of defendants in criminal cases.</content>

    <title>Unwilling to Reskill? Experimental Evidence from Real-World Jobseekers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study barriers preventing jobseekers from pursuing reskilling in high-demand occupations. Using a discrete choice experiment, we quantify the demand for reskilling among Italian jobseekers in two white-collar high-demand occupations—information technology assistant and construction technician—and identify its main determinants. Willingness to pay estimates show that participants are willing to pay to reskill into IT, but would require compensation to reskill into construction. Beliefs about monetary returns and social status help explain differences in reskilling demand, but perceived identity fit in the target occupation emerges as the most important individual-level factor shaping reskilling decisions. A light-touch randomized information intervention providing data on occupational returns significantly increases both stated interest in reskilling and actual engagement in real-world training.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The global expansion of renewable energy is key to addressing climate change. After a decade of dramatic cost reductions—especially for solar photovoltaics and wind—renewables now approach cost parity with fossil generation. While this cost reduction has led to a steep increase in solar and wind power in several countries, the global share of solar and wind generation remains modest—approximately 15% as of 2023. This article reviews recent economic studies and identifies three central challenges and corresponding opportunities for scaling up renewable energy—underdeveloped regulatory and market design, insufficient intertemporal market integration, and inadequate spatial market integration. The insights from this review highlight effective ways to accelerate the global transition to renewable energy.</content>

    <title>How Monetary Policy Is Made: Lessons from Historical FOMC Discussions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a new dataset of FOMC meeting transcripts from 1966 to 1990 to analyze the sources of heterogeneity in individual monetary policy preferences and study how this heterogeneity shapes policy decisions. Using these detailed discussions, we manually quantify and characterize each FOMC participants’ preferred policies along with their reasoning and justification. We show that participants' beliefs about the effects of monetary policy—specifically, their perceived slope of the Phillips Curve—play a central role. Participants who believe monetary policy has stronger effects on real activity are more likely to cite output as a justification for easing, while those perceiving stronger price effects emphasize inflation as a reason for tightening. We then show that the Chair plays a unique and powerful role in reconciling these views, not just in setting policy rates, but also in minimizing dissent. The latter occurs because dissenters find their ability to influence policy in subsequent meetings is significantly curtailed.</content>

    <title>The Labor Market Return to Permanent Residency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many temporary foreign worker programs issue “closed” visas that effectively tie workers to a single employer, restricting worker mobility and weakening bargaining power. We study the labor market return to temporary foreign workers (TFWs) gaining permanent residency (PR), which loosens this mobility restriction. Using administrative data linking matched employer-employee data in Canada to temporary and permanent visa records from 2004–2014 along with an event-study design, we find that gaining PR leads to a sharp, immediate, and persistent increase in the job switching rate of 21.7 percentage points and an increase in earnings of 5.7 percent three years after PR. Workers also sort into high-wage firms after gaining PR, and the increase in the firm pay premium is roughly 56 percent of the total earnings gain. We find larger earnings gains for job switchers across industries, low-skilled workers, and workers from low-income countries. To guide and interpret our reduced-form results, we develop a search-and-matching model featuring heterogeneous workers and firms. Permanent residents and native-born workers search for jobs in the same labor market and engage in on-the-job search, while TFWs search separately within a segmented labor market and do not receive outside wage offers. We calibrate the model to match our reduced-form results, and we use it to simulate the long-run effects of PR and consider two counterfactual policies: (1) increasing the cost to firms of posting a TFW vacancy and (2) allowing TFWs to switch employers freely under “open” visas. We evaluate how these policies affect output, wages, profits, and overall social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct an international panel data set comprising three distinct yet plausible measures of government indebtedness: the debt-to-GDP, the interest-to-GDP, and the debt-to-equity ratios. Our analysis reveals that these measures yield differing conclusions about recent trends in government indebtedness. While the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached historically high levels, the other two indicators show either no clear trend or a declining pattern over recent decades. We argue for the development of stronger theoretical foundations for the measures employed in the literature, suggesting that, without such grounding, assertions about debt (un)sustainability may be premature.</content>

    <title>A Unified Theory of Delegated Capital Management</title>

      <name>Jonathan B. Berk &amp; Peter M. DeMarzo</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified theory of delegated capital management by extending the paradigm of Berk and Green (2004)  from mutual funds to alternative assets. With competitive markets and rational investors, we derive the optimal contract and account for observed regularities --- performance fees, persistent alpha, and limits on capital. The key distinction between mutual funds and alternatives is the liquidity of the underlying assets. When assets are illiquid, it is optimal to acquire information about the manager's skill. A positive alpha is therefore necessary to compensate informed investors and a performance based contract is required to induce these investors to allocate their capital optimally. At the same time, a free-rider problem emerges that requires capital constraints on uninformed investors. Thus, liquidity of the underlying assets explains the contrasting contract structures across sectors.</content>

    <title>Global Ripple Effects of Corporate Tax Reforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel indicator for the People's Bank of China monetary policy stance, we estimate a policy rule that accounts for the dual nature of its price stability mandate—encompassing domestic inflation and the exchange rate—and for the evolution of its operational framework.  The “Ins”: The domestic transmission follows textbook patterns, with exceptions due to the active management of the renminbi and the financial account. The "Outs": International spillovers are powerful and affect commodity markets, global production and trade. The pass-through to foreign (US) prices is substantial. Financial spillovers are second-order, and mostly derivative from trade spillovers.</content>

    <title>Payment-Chain Crises</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces an endogenous network of payment chains into a business cycle model. Motivated by evidence of linked payments across firms in Costa Rica, we develop a framework where production orders form bilateral relations: some payments are executed immediately, while others---chained payments---are delayed until upstream payments are received. These chains capture real-world situations in which firms must wait to be paid before paying their own suppliers, leaving resources temporarily idle even when demand and capacity exist. In equilibrium, agents choose the amount of chained payments given interest rates and access to internal funds or credit lines. This choice determines the payment-chain network and aggregate total-factor productivity (TFP). The paper characterizes equilibrium dynamics and pecuniary externalities when agents internalize their own payment delays but not the delays imposed on others.</content>

    <title>Employment Impacts of the CHIPS Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The CHIPS and Science Act, enacted in August 2022, is a key element of the revival of U.S. industrial policy. We examine the short-term employment effects of the act. Drawing on quarterly industry-by-county data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), we implement two county-level difference-in-difference designs, the first comparing counties with pre-existing semiconductor facilities to other counties with high-tech industries and the second comparing counties with semiconductor fabrication facilities (which were targeted for the bulk of the CHIPS funding) to counties with non-fabrication semiconductor facilities. Using both approaches, we find robust, positive employment impacts in affected counties. The effects began at the time of the passage in the Senate of a precursor bill, in anticipation of the signing of the CHIPS Act. Our preferred estimates suggest an increase of 110 jobs per affected county in the first design and 180 jobs per affected county in the second design. We also find robust positive impacts on local construction employment. Evidence on total employment and GDP at the county level, as well as on employment in upstream input sectors, is mixed. Simple back-of-the-envelope calculations (which come with caveats) suggest national direct employment effects of approximately 15,000-16,000 jobs in the core semiconductor sector and indirect effects of 28,000-35,000 jobs in related sectors.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Regulating Greenwashing: Evidence from Europe’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on mutual fund flows and investment sustainability. The SFDR classifies funds into three categories to promote transparency and curb greenwashing: those with a sustainable investment objective (Article 9 or “dark green”), those that promote environmental characteristics (Article 8 or “light green”), and others (Article 6). Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the SFDR had little effect on fund flows or portfolio sustainability. The disclosures were ineffective in part because they offered little new or clear information beyond what investors could already infer from fund names and mandates. In an experimental setting, we show that the current disclosures have minimal impact on investor decisions, but making the information more intuitive could improve the regulation’s effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We take a new perspective on identification in structural dynamic models: rather than imposing restrictions, we optimize an objective. This provides new theoretical insights into traditional Cholesky identification. A correlation-maximizing objective yields an Order- and Scale-Invariant Identification Scheme (OASIS) that selects the orthogonal rotation that best aligns structural shocks with their reduced-form innovations. We revisit a large number of SVAR studies and find, across 22 published SVARs, that the correlations between structural and reduced-form shocks are generally high.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the determinants of corporate cash holdings by extending the standard q theory of investment with financing frictions and productivity shocks. While existing models predict a low propensity to hold cash, we show that realistic cash holdings arise only when three ingredients are combined: 1.) costly external financing, 2.) persistent productivity shocks, and 3.) contemporaneous productivity shocks. With costly external financing, persistent productivity shocks generate predictable cash flows and investment opportunities, but yield little need for savings since the internally generated cash flows are aligned with the investment needs. Contemporaneous shocks make internally generated cash flows random, inducing firms to hold cash at levels consistent with those observed empirically.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We review new developments in formal theory as applied to racial stratification. Across this literature, we discuss how discrimination produces benefits for advantaged groups at a cost to marginalized groups, how groups resolve conflicts between individual and collective interests, how direct discrimination is transformed into persistent inequality, and the implications of these forces for racial disparities, efficiency, and social welfare. For researchers active in Stratification Economics, we highlight parallels between intuitions about dimensions of racial discrimination and inequality developed by SE and insights from formal models by theorists outside SE. For formal theorists interested in working on questions of race and inequality, we provide an overview of how SE conceptualizes racial stratification and identify open questions where formal theory can provide more rigorous micro-foundations to these intuitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2025, statutory tariff rates on U.S. imports rose to levels not seen in over one hundred years. What are the implications for prices? On the one hand, shipping lags, exemptions, and enforcement gaps have kept the actual implemented rates at only half of the statutory rates, moderating the tariffs’ impact. On the other hand, tariff pass-through to U.S. import prices is almost 100 percent, so the United States is bearing a large share of the costs. We study the incidence of the 2018-2019 and 2025 U.S. tariffs and discuss implications for U.S. sourcing, domestic manufacturing costs, and the dollar.</content>

    <title>Why is Private lending so Popular?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private lending has exploded over the past two decades. To explore its rise, we focus on Business Development Companies (BDCs). We show that their growth is intimately connected to growth in private equity. Many BDCs are directly connected to large private equity organizations, and their compensation structures mirror those in private equity. BDCs not only provide debt for PE-sponsored deals, they make PE-like investments themselves involving deferred interest, preferred equity, and exposure to underlying assets. Understanding private lending's connections to private equity is especially salient for the rapidly growing retail investor segment and has important implications for regulation.</content>

    <title>Intergenerational Welfare Assessments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies welfare assessments in economies with rich demographics. We introduce the notion of demographically disconnected economies, those with no date at which all individuals are concurrently alive. We identify the unique class of units that always enables meaningful welfare comparisons in such economies: those based on perpetual consumption, that is, consumption at all dates. Using these units, we uncover a novel possibility: feasible perturbations of Pareto efficient allocations can yield Kaldor-Hicks efficiency gains. We also introduce a decomposition that attributes intertemporal-sharing efficiency gains to financial frictions or demographic differences. These results allow us to derive new insights in three workhorse intergenerational models: (i) Samuelson (1958) two-date-life model, offering a novel rationale for social security; (ii) Diamond (1965) growth model, providing a new theory for capital taxation and capital over-/under-accumulation; and (iii) Samuelson (1958) three-date-life model, decomposing the efficiency gains from intergenerational transfers into frictional and demographic sources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employing large language models to analyze official documents, we construct a comprehensive record of daily changes in de jure restrictions on cross-border flows worldwide since the 1950s. Our analysis uncovers the wide array of instruments used to regulate cross-border financial flows and documents their evolving prevalence over the past seven decades. The fine granularity of the new measures allows us to characterize cross-country and time-series variation across eight categories of restrictions, further distinguishing by flow, direction, instrument type, and overall policy stance. We exploit the high frequency nature of the new data to document novel patterns in the use of these restrictions, as well as their relationship to crises, and political economy determinants. We validate our measures against established indicators of capital account regulation and show that our LLM-based classifications both replicate and substantially extend these benchmarks along multiple dimensions. Finally, we examine policymakers’ stated motivations for adopting these restrictions and account for the intensive margin of these policy actions.</content>

    <title>Bank Opacity and Deposit Rates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks face a dual mandate of raising cheap deposits while avoiding liquidity risk. We propose a novel mechanism whereby banks use portfolio opacity to meet this objective. Specifically, banks choose opaque portfolios to secure cheap long-term funding while trading off insolvency and illiquidity. We show that while opacity lowers deposit rates, it also leaves depositors with only noisy information about the bank’s solvency, making them cautious about keeping their funds in the bank—particularly when interest rates are high. We show that opacity raises bank profits, sometimes at the cost of exposure to high probability of illiquidity. In particular, in high-rate environments, banks adopt excessive opacity to further reduce deposit rates—at the cost of more frequent early failures.</content>

    <title>Broadband Internet Access and Adolescent Mental Health in the U.S.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Broadband internet has become a critical component of U.S. infrastructure, but policymakers are increasingly concerned that the widespread adoption of this technology has adversely affected adolescent mental health. To test this hypothesis, we use 2009–2019 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Survey data and leverage the nationwide rollout of broadband internet. First, we show that adolescents in states with greater broadband internet access reported spending more time online. Next, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in broadband internet access was associated with a 9.3–16.5-percent increase in adolescent suicide ideation. While we document increases in suicide ideation for both girls and boys, the results are most pronounced for adolescent girls. Exploring potential mechanisms, we show that greater broadband internet access was associated with increases in cyberbullying and body dissatisfaction among adolescent girls and a reduction in the likelihood that adolescent boys reported getting an adequate amount of sleep.</content>

    <title>Extreme Temperatures Promote High-Fat Diets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extreme temperatures threaten agriculture and exacerbate global food insecurity, yet their direct impact on dietary choices remains poorly understood. We provide novel evidence of how short-term exposures to extreme temperatures affect macronutrient intake in China. We show that both hot and cold weather elevate high-fat diet risks. In particular, hot weather reduces carbohydrate and protein consumption but not fat intake, while cold weather increases all nutrient intake, particularly fats. Temperature-induced dietary changes are shaped primarily by physiological responses to thermal stress, whereas physical activities demonstrate little effect. Technologies that improve indoor thermal comfort (via fans, air conditioners, and heating systems) substantially mitigate high-fat diet risks. Socioeconomic disparities are evident, with rural and poor individuals more likely to adopt high-fat diets under hot or cold weather. Projections indicate that more extreme temperatures due to climate change may increase the prevalence of high-fat diets nationally, while substantial regional heterogeneity emerges, with declines in northeast China and increases in southern China. These results highlight a crucial but overlooked pathway linking climate change to dietary health inequality.</content>

    <title>Quality Upgrading in Global Supply Chains: Evidence from Colombian Coffee</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do the returns to quality upgrading pass through supply chains to primary producers? We explore this question in the context of Colombia’s coffee sector, in which market outcomes depend on interactions between farmers, exporters (which operate mills), and international buyers, and contracts are for the most part not legally enforceable. We formalize the hypothesis that quality upgrading is subject to a key hold-up problem: producing high-quality beans requires long-term investments by farmers, but there is no guarantee that an exporter will pay a quality premium when the beans arrive at its mills. An international buyer with sufficient demand for high-quality coffee can solve this problem by imposing a vertical restraint on the exporter, requiring the exporter to pay a quality premium to farmers. Combining internal records from two exporters, comprehensive administrative data, and the staggered rollout of a buyer-driven quality-upgrading program, we find empirical support for the key theoretical predictions, both the lack of pass-through of quality premia under normal circumstances and the possibility of a buyer-driven solution through a vertical restraint. Calibration of the model suggests that one-third to two-thirds of the (substantial) gains from the program accrue to farmers, with the vertical restraint playing a critical role. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that quality upgrading can provide a path to higher incomes for farmers, but also that it is unlikely to be viable under standard market conditions in the sector.</content>

    <title>What Are the Benefits of Metro Rail in Mumbai, India?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effects of the first metro rail line in Mumbai using administrative data on assessed property prices from 2011-18 for 723 subzones in the city. Comparing areas within 1 km of the metro with those beyond 1 km but within 3 km, we estimate the effects on property values for commercial, industrial, and residential properties. We find a significant and persistent increase in prices of 6-8% for residential and commercial land use categories in treated areas relative to control areas after Metro Line 1 opens. We show that commute time savings and improvements in employment accessibility are plausible mechanisms underlying these effects.</content>

    <title>One Instrument, Many Treatments: Instrumental Variables Identification of Multiple Causal Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many instrumental variables applications specify a single Bernoulli treatment. But instruments may change outcomes through multiple pathways or by varying treatment intensity. Lottery instruments that boost charter school enrollment, for instance, may affect outcomes by lengthening time enrolled in a charter school and by moving students between charter schools of different types. We analyze the identification problem such scenarios present in a framework that generalizes the always-taker/never-taker/complier partition of treatment response types to cover a wide range of multinomial and ordered treatments with heterogenous potential outcomes. This framework yields novel estimators in which a single randomly assigned instrument identifies (i) causal effects averaged over complier types and (ii) a causal conditional expectation function that captures effects for each element in a set of response types. Three empirical applications demonstrate the utility of these results. The first extends an earlier analysis of the Head Start Impact Study allowing for multiple fallbacks. The second examines two causal channels for the impact of post-secondary financial aid on degree completion. The third estimates effects of additional births (an ordered treatment) on mothers’ earnings.</content>
