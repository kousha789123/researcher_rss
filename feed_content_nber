    <title>The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications: Comment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;De Loecker et al. (2020)  (DEU) estimate that markups increased significantly in the United States from 1955 to 2016. We find this result is sensitive to unreported sample restrictions that drop 27% of the available observations. Applying the methodology as described in the article to the full sample, markup increases are more muted until late in the sample period, and are almost entirely driven by Finance and Insurance firms. If these firms are removed, markup increases are modest. We conclude that the DEU methodology and data, as they are described in the article, do not support the conclusion that broad-based increases in market power have occurred in recent decades.

This paper was motivated by an earlier NBER working paper.  The authors of that paper have posted a response to this paper. The authors of this paper have prepared a rejoinder to the response.</content>

    <title>Forecasting Social Science: Evidence from 100 Projects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Forecasts about research findings affect critical scientific decisions, such as what treatments an R&amp;D lab invests in, or which papers a researcher decides to write. But what do we know about the accuracy of these forecasts? We analyze a unique data set of all 100 projects posted on the Social Science Prediction Platform from 2020 to 2024, which received 53,298 forecasts in total, including 66 projects for which we also have results. We show that forecasters, on average, over-estimate treatment effects; however, the average forecast is quite predictive of the actual treatment effect. We also examine differences in accuracy across forecasters. Academics have a slightly higher accuracy than non-academics, but expertise in a field does not increase accuracy. A panel of motivated repeat forecasters has higher accuracy, but this does not extend more broadly to all repeat forecasters. Confidence in the accuracy of one's forecasts is perversely associated with lower accuracy. We also document substantial cross-study correlation in accuracy among forecasters and identify a group of "superforecasters". Finally, we relate our findings to results in the literature as well as to expert forecasts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effects of the nationwide transition in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) from paper vouchers to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on store decisions to seek authorization to accept WIC benefits. We combine novel administrative data from “The Integrity Profile” (USDA administrative data on stores participating in WIC and their WIC reimbursements) with new nationwide policy data on WIC EBT implementation. Using a staggered adoption difference-in-differences approach, we find that the transition had heterogeneous and occasionally unanticipated effects across states. The number of WIC authorized independent vendors declined 10% following WIC EBT implementation. We find no significant effect of WIC EBT implementation on WIC redemptions in a subset of ZIP Codes with sufficient vendors for data sharing. Vendors in states that were early adopters of WIC EBT have more negative effects on the probability of WIC authorization, which may be due to learning effects or improvements in technology over time. Past experience with EBT implementation by financial services providers hired by states to help them implement WIC EBT processing (processors) reduces the magnitude of these negative effects of EBT implementation on store participation in WIC.</content>

    <title>Who Bears the Burden of Climate Inaction?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change is already increasing temperatures and raising the frequency of natural disasters in the United States. In this paper, we examine several major vectors through which climate change affects US households, including cost increases associated with home insurance claims and increased cooling, as well as sources of increased mortality. Although we consider only a subset of climate costs over recent decades, we find an aggregate annual cost averaging between $400 and $900 per household; in 10 percent of counties, costs exceed $1,300 per household. Costs vary significantly by geography, with the largest costs occurring in some western regions of the United States, the Gulf Coast, and Florida. Climate costs also typically disproportionately burden lower-income households. Our work suggests the importance of research that looks beyond rising temperatures to extreme weather events; so far, natural disasters account for the bulk of the burden of climate change in the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using transaction-level data on US congressional stock trades, we find that lawmakers who later ascend to leadership positions perform similarly to matched peers beforehand but outperform them by 47 percentage points annually after ascension. Leaders’ superior performance arises through two mechanisms. The political influence channel is reflected in higher returns when their party controls the chamber, sales of stocks preceding regulatory actions, and purchase of stocks whose firms receiving more government contracts and favorable party support on bills. The corporate access channel is reflected in stock trades that predict subsequent corporate news and greater returns on donor-owned or home-state firms.</content>

    <title>Effects of WIC on Birth Outcomes: Evidence from Newly Digitized Data from the National Archives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the effect of nutrition—delivered during pregnancy via the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)—on infant health. We contribute to the literature by adding new data on WIC rollout from the National Archives, employing novel methods, investigating new mechanisms, and analyzing previously unexplored infant outcomes, including the distribution of birth weight. We find robust evidence that access to WIC in a woman’s county of residence by the start of their second trimester led to a reduction in the probability of an infant being of low birth weight and to a higher average birth weight, with larger in magnitude effects for infants with Black mothers than for those with White mothers. Our results suggest a lower bound for treatment-on-the-treated effects for low birth weight of -0.9 percentage points and for birth weight of around 33 grams for infants with Black mothers, both economically significant. For White mothers, the effects on low birth weight are much smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant. These findings show WIC reduced overall disparities between Blacks and Whites in low birth weight by 3.6 percent.</content>

    <title>Information Acquisition By Mutual Fund Investors: Evidence from Stock Trading Suspensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mutual funds create liquidity for investors by issuing demandable equity shares while holding illiquid securities. We study the implications of this liquidity creation by examining frequent trading suspensions in China, which temporarily eliminate market liquidity in affected stocks. These suspensions cause significant mispricing of mutual funds due to inaccurate valuations of their illiquid holdings. We find that investors actively acquire information about suspended stocks held by mutual funds, driving flows into underpriced funds. This information is subsequently incorporated into stock prices when trading resumes. Our findings suggest that mutual fund liquidity creation stimulates information acquisition about illiquid, information-sensitive assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Suicide rates among older adults have been rising over time in the United States.  At the same time, more individuals have been suffering with chronic pain and illness, which are often underlying risk factors for suicide.  As self-medication with marijuana has become common, we ask whether access to legal marijuana for medical and recreational purposes reduces suicides rates among older individuals.  We find that suicide rates among older age groups decline following the opening of recreational marijuana dispensaries, especially among older Whites, and middle-aged White males and females with low levels of education.</content>

    <title>A Sufficient Statistics Approach to Optimal Corporate Taxes</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper characterizes the equity–efficiency tradeoff of corporate taxation using a stylized model that draws on the corporate investment and tax incidence literatures. We derive optimal corporate tax formulas in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities and welfare weights on workers and firm owners. While much empirical work emphasizes investment responses, these elasticities do not feature in optimal tax formulas. The elasticity of taxable profits is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency costs of the corporate tax. Higher corporate tax rates are desirable when firm owners have low welfare weights, and less desirable when taxing profits reduces wages. These empirical objects remain central across extensions, including heterogeneous production technologies, tax sheltering, international capital mobility, monopsony, and linear labor income taxes. We survey the empirical literature and find that existing estimates can support a wide range of optimal tax rates. An inverse-optimum analysis provides combinations of welfare weights of workers and firm owners that would rationalize the post-2017 US corporate tax cut as optimal.</content>

    <title>Ambiguity vs. Risk in Investment Decisions: An Illustration from Green Finance</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) or risk provide a greater discouragement to investment? There is general agreement in the financial press that uncertainty discourages investment, with uncertainty here meaning any situation where important future policy variables (such as tariffs or tax rates) are not known. And it seems intuitively plausible that situations of ambiguity are “more uncertain” than those of risk: under risk, although the outcome is not known, its expected value is, whereas under ambiguity we have a distribution of possible expected values. In this paper we show that under quite general circumstances it is the case that ambiguity deters investment more than an equivalent risk. An equivalent risk is one characterized by a compound lottery reflecting the ambiguous situation, but without ambiguity aversion. We show that there will always be investments opportunities that are rejected when characterized by ambiguity but are accepted when characterized by risk with an equivalent compound lottery, and that the converse is not true: there are no investments that would be made under ambiguity that would not be made under equivalent risk. We develop the analysis in the context of the emerging field of green finance.</content>

    <title>The Economic Legacy of Racial Trauma in the American South</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the trauma associated with exposure to racial violence affect economic outcomes? We study this question in the context of lynchings of Black citizens in the American South between 1880 and 1940 and provide systematic evidence of long-run economic impacts of that violence for the broader community and the effects’ persistence across generations. First, using data on averted lynchings and matched placebos as counterfactuals, we show that children indirectly exposed to the racial trauma of lynchings (proxied by close proximity to the victim’s household location) exhibit a reduction in occupational income score and likelihood of holding a white collar occupation, in their prime earning years as adults. We also observe intergenerational effects: children of the individuals who were exposed (as children) to lynchings see, as adults observed in 1940, a reduction in their income relative to counterfactual individuals. By documenting long-run and intergenerational economic effects of exposure to lynchings, we add empirical evidence to an interdisciplinary literature that identifies racial trauma as a distinctive and durable form of psychological harm.</content>

    <title>Moving to Fluidity: Regional Growth and Labor Market Churn</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the connection between regional growth trends and labor market dynamics. New data on manufacturing worker flows for U.S. cities 1969-1981 show more new hires and more voluntary quits in growing cities, but more forced layoffs in shrinking cities. Recessions are special in growing cities in that hires and quits drop, whereas in shrinking cities layoffs rise. A quantitative business cycle model with migration and on-the-job search accounts for a large share of variation in growth and worker flows both over time and across space. Growing cities in the South and West had low job creation costs and only gradual in-migration, so tight labor markets encouraged more on-the-job search. In those cities, aggregate job destruction shocks generated recessions with lower labor market churn. In the shrinking cities of the Rust Belt, in contrast, churn was always low and responded little in recessions.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Widespread Online Education on Market Structure and Enrollment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the rapid expansion of Brazil's private online higher-education sector and its effects on market structure and college enrollment. Exploiting regional and field-specific variation in online education penetration, we find that online programs expand access for older students but divert younger students from higher-quality in-person programs. Greater competition lowers tuition prices but also reduces the supply of in-person degrees. Using an equilibrium model of college education, we show that in the absence of online programs, total enrollment would be 14 percent lower, while in-person enrollment would rise by 33 percent. On net, aggregate labor-market value added declines by 1.4 percent. Online education raises value added for older students, who benefit from increased access, but lowers it for younger students, who shift toward lower-return online options. Counterfactual policies that restrict online enrollment to older cohorts could increase value added for younger students without reducing gains for older cohorts.</content>

    <title>Good Data and Bad Data: The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how a monopolist’s use of consumer data for price discrimination affects welfare. To answer this question, we develop a model of market segmentation subject to residual uncertainty. We fully characterize when data usage monotonically increases or decreases welfare or when the effect is non-monotone. The characterization reduces the problem to one with only two demand curves, and gives a condition for the two-demand-curves case that highlights that information affects welfare in three distinct ways. In the non-monotone case, we provide tight bounds on the welfare effects of information and identify the best local direction for providing additional information.</content>

    <title>Labor Market Strength and Declining Community College Enrollment</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Declining U.S. college enrollments over the past 15 years have triggered questions about the health of the postsecondary sector. Using institution-level data, we make four points. First, such declines are driven not by the four-year sector but by two-year community colleges, which have apparently shrunk by over 30% since the peak of the Great Recession. Second, over one-third of this apparent decline is an artifact of some community colleges being reclassified as offering four-year degrees. Third, pre-Great Recession data shows a 1 percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate increases first-time community college enrollment by 2 percent, suggesting many students are on the margin between community college and job opportunities. For-profit college enrollments are similarly countercyclical, while public and private four-year college enrollments appear acyclical. Our estimates suggest that strengthening labor markets explain about 60% of the post-Great Recession decline in first-time community college enrollment. Fourth, students whose enrollment decisions are most sensitive to labor market conditions appear unlikely to have completed a degree. Though declining community college enrollments are a challenge for postsecondary institutions, it is less clear whether they signal a problem for students on the margin of enrollment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Take-up of means-tested transfer programs in the United States remains incomplete despite their substantial value to eligible households. We contribute to the literature on determinants of program participation by providing the first causal estimates of how proximity to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offices affects program participation. Using administrative data on SNAP receipt in a single state linked to geocoded office locations, we exploit quasi-experimental variation from frequent office openings and closings. Event study estimates show that SNAP participation in a census tract decreases following the closure of an office by 7–9 percent over two years, with suggestive evidence of increases in participation following office openings. These effects are concentrated in urban areas and are robust to alternative specifications and tests of endogeneity in changes in office placement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building a cohesive nation-state amid deep ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity is a central challenge for many governments. This paper examines the process of nation building, drawing lessons from the remarkable experience of Indonesia over the past century. I discuss conceptual perspectives on nation building and review Indonesia's historical nation-building trajectory. I then synthesize insights from four studies exploring distinct policy interventions in Indonesia---population resettlement, administrative unit proliferation, land reform, and mass schooling---to understand their effects on social cohesion and national integration. Together, these cases underscore the promise and pitfalls of nation-building efforts in diverse societies, offering guidance for future research and policymaking to support these endeavors in Indonesia and beyond.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Guaranteed Basic Income on Crime Perpetration and Victimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first experimental evidence on the impact of providing a guaranteed basic income on criminal perpetration and victimization. We analyze a nationwide randomized controlled trial that provided 2,000 unemployed individuals in Finland with an unconditional monthly payment of 560 Euros for two years (2017-2018), while 173,222 comparable individuals remained under the existing social safety net. Using comprehensive administrative data on police reports and district court trials, we estimate precise zero effects on criminal perpetration and victimization. Point estimates are small and statistically insignificant across all crime categories. Our confidence intervals rule out reductions in perpetration of 5 percent or more for crime reports and 10 percent or more for criminal charges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an overview of the explanations for the relative lack of state formation historically in Africa. In doing so we systematically document for the first time the extent to which Africa was politically decentralized, calculating that in 1880 there were probably 45,000 independent polities which were rarely organized on ethnic lines. At most 2% of these could be classified as states. We advance a new argument for this extreme political decentralization positing that African societies were deliberately organized to stop centralization emerging. In this they were successful. We point out some key aspects of African societies that helped them to manage this equilibrium. We also emphasize how the organization of the economy was subservient to these political goals.</content>

    <title>Delivering Higher Pay? The Impacts of a Task-Level Pay Standard in the Gig Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does a task-level minimum pay requirement for gig workers affect their earnings and employment? We study this question in the context of a January 2024 law in Seattle that establishes a per-task minimum pay standard for app-based delivery workers. Drawing on novel cross-platform, trip-level gig activity data, we compare earnings and employment trajectories around the implementation of the law for workers who were doing delivery work in Seattle before the reform against workers who had been active in other regions of Washington State. We find that the minimum pay law raised delivery pay per task, though the increases in base pay per task were partially offset by a substantial reduction in average tips, a major component of delivery pay. At the same time, the policy led to a reduction in the number of tasks completed by highly attached incumbent drivers (but not an increase in exit from delivery work), completely offsetting increased pay per task and leading to zero effect on monthly earnings. We find evidence that drivers experienced more unpaid idle time and longer distances driven between tasks, but find no evidence that drivers reduced their total time working on delivery apps and only limited evidence of switching from delivery to ride-hailing work. Using a simple model of the labor market for platform delivery drivers, we show that our evidence is consistent with free entry of drivers into the delivery market driving down the task-finding rate until expected earnings return to their pre-reform level. These findings highlight the challenges of raising pay in spot markets for tasks where there is free entry of workers.</content>

    <title>Are E-Cigarette Taxes Losing their Bite?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise in nicotine vaping among U.S. teenagers in the late 2010s prompted tobacco control advocates to press for higher electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) taxes to curb their use. This study is the first to explore how the effectiveness of e-cigarette taxation as an anti-vaping policy tool has evolved over time. Using data from several nationally representative data sources and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find that since 2020, the effectiveness of a one dollar increase in ENDS taxes in curbing youth nicotine vaping has declined by over 50 percent. This finding is consistent with the marginal youth vaper becoming more tax inelastic over time. Descriptive evidence shows that the composition of youth ENDS users appears to have shifted toward those with a higher addictive stock and a greater taste for risk, which could make youths less tax responsive. For adults, where nicotine vaping rates are stable or slightly rising and compositional shifts are somewhat less pronounced, we find much less evidence that ENDS tax effectiveness has changed over time.</content>

    <title>Waiting for the Right Offer: Laboratory Evidence on How News Affects Bargaining</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a series of laboratory experiments that implement the Daley and Green (2020) model to examine whether the gradual, exogenous revelation of sellers’ private information influences the occurrence of trades in a bilateral bargaining setting with a static lemon condition. We find that while information does not increase efficiency, it reduces the likelihood that buyers incur losses when trading with low-quality sellers. Anticipating that additional signals will arrive, buyers hesitate to finalize deals immediately and exhibit a “waiting for news” effect, making sizable offer adjustments only when sufficient positive signals have accumulated. In contrast, informed sellers are less sensitive to news but appear to wait for the offer that they deem acceptable.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Paid Sick Leave Mandates on Individuals with Disabilities: Evidence from Social Security Disability Claims</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid sick leave mandates (PSLs), which have been adopted by 18 states and the District of Columbia, require employers to provide regular wages when workers take short-term leave for their own or a family member’s medical needs. This study is the first to explore the effects of PSL adoption on participation in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, as well as the health of persons with disabilities. We find that statewide PSLs are associated with a 6-9 percent increase in initial claims for SSI and joint SSI/SSDI benefits. These applications translate to an increase in beneficiaries, strongest among children under age 18. An exploration of the primary mechanisms likely underlying this result reveals PSL-induced (1) increases in time spent offering informal caregiving of those with disabilities, which may reduce the costs of applying to SS(D)I programs, and (2) increases in health care utilization among children with disabilities. Evidence for negative work hours effects of PSLs is weaker, concentrated among spouses of persons with disabilities. Finally, we find that PSL mandates lead to modest improvements in health among both children and adults with disabilities.</content>

    <title>Medicaid Coverage and Postpartum Opioid Use Disorder Treatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women in the United States has risen more than fourfold since 1999, making substance use a leading cause of maternal mortality. Medicaid finances the majority of births and substance use disorder treatment in the U.S., yet until recently, coverage typically ends 60 days postpartum, potentially disrupting care continuity. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 extends postpartum Medicaid coverage from two months to 12 months, creating a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of coverage on access to medications for OUD (MOUD), the gold-standard treatment. We use linked nationwide all-payer medical and retail pharmacy claims from IQVIA in a difference-in-differences framework comparing postpartum MOUD continuity between Medicaid- and commercially-insured parents with a prenatal history of MOUD use. Extended Medicaid postpartum coverage increases Medicaid-financed MOUD months by 8.55%, the likelihood of continuing MOUD beyond 60 days by 5.12%, and total MOUD supply days by 7.99%. These gains are slightly offset by other payer reductions, yet result in a net 5.10% increase in overall MOUD months and 4.64% rise in treatment adherence. Findings highlight the importance of coverage duration as a practical lever to sustain MOUD treatment in the crucial first year after delivery period.</content>

    <title>Moral Regulation and Cultural Production: Evidence from Hollywood</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Moral regulation is widespread across societies, yet its consequences have seldom been examined empirically. We study the Hays Code (July 1934–1960s), which imposed systematic moral guidelines on American cinema. Using a regression-discontinuity design, with non-U.S. films providing a comparison group, we find that the moral compliance of U.S. films rose sharply after 1935 and remained high for two decades. The Code also reshaped protagonists and political tone: protagonists became less likely to be women or working class, and political tones grew more conservative. Filmmakers adapted both by increasing compliance within genres and by shifting across them: less-compliant Drama declined while more-compliant Western and Action rose. Companies with a larger market size and immigrant film directors exhibited stronger responses. These findings reveal how moral constraint, market, and identity jointly shape cultural production and how well-intentioned moral regulation can generate broad and often unintended spillovers.</content>

    <title>Financial Returns to Equity Investments in Infrastructure in Emerging-Market and Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the scarcity of infrastructure in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), in the absence of readily accessible data on the historical performance of EMDE infrastructure as an asset class, private investors are reluctant to finance infrastructure projects in these countries. We begin to fill this information gap by computing the financial returns from equity investments in primarily unlisted firms in EMDEs made by the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group. The public market equivalent of 266 equity investments in core infrastructure by the IFC, with starting dates from 1961 to March 2020, was 1.17 using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark, and 1.26 using the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. On average, over the past six decades, equity stakes in emerging-market infrastructure backed by the IFC thus delivered higher returns than investments in portfolios of publicly listed equities. Data from the full sample of IFC equity investments reveal that, on average, a diversified portfolio of investments in infrastructure-related sectors, and indeed, in all sectors more generally, generated significant positive financial returns, albeit with variation across decades.</content>

    <title>Measurement Matters: Financial Reporting and Productivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how differences in financial reporting practices shape firm productivity. Leveraging new audit questions in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), and complementary tax return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and detailed financial records from Sageworks, we find that (i) variation in reporting quality explains 10--20 percent of intra-industry total factor productivity dispersion, and (ii) evidence of complementarity between the effects of financial audits and management practices driving firm productivity. We then examine the underlying mechanisms. First, audits function as a managerial technology, improving the precision of internal information and raising efficiency, with stronger effects in competitive, low-margin industries and among younger firms. Second, exploiting cross-state variation in tax incentives, we show that audits constrain underreporting and mitigate the downward bias in measured productivity. Together, these results highlight the underrated importance of financial reporting quality driving firm productivity.</content>

    <title>Imputation-Powered Inference for Missing Covariates</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Missing covariate data is a prevalent problem in empirical research. We provide a novel framework for handling missing covariate data for estimation and inference in downstream tasks. Our general framework provides an automatic and easy-to-use pipeline for empirical researchers: First, missing values are imputed using virtually any imputation method under general observation patterns. Second, we automatically correct for the imputation bias and adaptively weight the imputed values according to their quality. Third, we use all available data, including imputed observations, to obtain more precise point estimates for the downstream task with valid confidence intervals. Our approach ensures valid inference while improving statistical efficiency by leveraging all available data. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under general missing data patterns and a broad class of imputation methods. Through simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over natural benchmarks, as it achieves both lower bias and variance while being robust to imputation quality. In a comprehensive empirical study of the dependence of equity markets on carbon emissions, we show that properly accounting for missing emissions data yields no evidence of correlation between stock returns and emissions directly produced by companies, but a negative correlation with value chain emissions.</content>

    <title>A Model of the Model: Unpacking CGE Results on Carbon Leakage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Computational general equilibrium (CGE) models can evaluate detailed tax reforms, trade restrictions, or environmental policy. These models can capture many complexities, but these complexities can make results difficult to interpret. Analytical general equilibrium (AGE) models provide better intuition and interpretation but cannot capture relevant complexities. We propose a method that employs AGE models to understand CGE models – a “model of the model”. We apply this idea to climate policy and carbon leakage – the increase in emissions elsewhere. Our AGE models identify seven key economic determinants of leakage within any one outcome. We then unpack results from three existing CGE models.</content>

    <title>Tariffs on Medical Goods: Pass-through, Geography, and Aggregate Costs to the US Healthcare System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Have recent tariffs resulted in increased costs for the US healthcare system? We examine US trade data and compile a database of statutory tariff changes. Tariffs on medical goods narrowly defined resulted in $3.4 Billion in duties assessed between February and July 2025—more than 10 times the same period in 2024, with a 55.8 percent rate of pass-through at the US border. We estimate that had medical goods imports observed in 2024 been subject to the statutory tariff levels prevailing in August 2025, assessed duties would have been $15.8 Billion, almost 30 times higher than those observed in real-time. Our aggregates understate imports of medical goods and other imports used in healthcare settings, as data limitations compel us to omit purchases of imported goods for construction, maintenance, and operations of facilities, as well as imports under certain HS10 and HS6 tariff codes that are used when identifying medical goods in many contexts but contain a mixture of imports for medical and non-medical purposes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How has aggregate income and welfare in the United States been affected by globalization and rapid productivity growth in emerging economies? We use the class of constant elasticity trade models to provide quantitative evidence on these questions. We find that reductions in worldwide trade frictions over the period from 1960-2020 reduced the share of the United States in global GDP but raised its aggregate welfare. Similarly, productivity growth in Japan and China led to a decline in the relative income of the United States, but brought aggregate welfare gains from the resulting expansion in global production possibilities. Trade integration and foreign productivity growth have relatively modest effects on domestic income and welfare compared to domestic productivity growth.</content>

    <title>How (Not) to Identify Demand Elasticities in Dynamic Asset Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate approaches to estimating demand elasticities in dynamic asset markets, both theoretically and empirically. We establish strict, necessary conditions that the dynamics of instrumented asset price variation must satisfy for valid identification. We illustrate these insights in a general equilibrium model of dynamic trade and derive the magnitude of biases that arise when these conditions are violated. Estimates based on static IO models are severely biased when the instrumented price variation is persistent or predictable. Empirically, we show that commonly used instruments yield elasticity estimates that are off by orders of magnitude, or even have the wrong sign. In contrast to standard multiplier calculations, our theory characterizes the dynamic asset market interventions required to sustain a given price path support process, with direct implications for policies such as Quantitative Easing (QE).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effect of California's 11 percent excise tax on firearms, introduced in July 2024, on retail prices. Using price quotes for 48 popular firearms from over 2,200 licensed dealers, we compare California prices to those in other states and to pre-tax trends. We find that prices in California increase by about 10% in response to the 11% tax. Results are consistent across gun types and show no evidence of border spillovers. These findings indicate that firearm excise taxes can effectively raise consumer prices.</content>

    <title>Avoiding Prejudice: Islamophobia and the Labor Supply of Arabs and Muslims in the U.S.</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides direct evidence that members of a disfavored group adjust their economic behavior in response to prejudice. We exploit plausibly exogenous, localized increases in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment generated by combat fatalities of U.S. service members from a given state during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. Linking detailed records on military fatalities with survey data, we estimate the causal effect of these shocks on the labor supply of Arab and Muslim men residing in the affected states. Following a home-state fatality, Arab and Muslim men reduce their weekly hours of work by approximately one percent relative to the baseline sample mean. The reduction is twice as large among the self-employed and concentrated in occupations requiring frequent customer or co-worker interaction. These patterns are consistent with avoidance-based sorting predicted by prejudice-based models of discrimination. The timing of the response coincides with short-lived increases in anti-Muslim hate crimes, confirming that the estimated effects reflect shifts in prejudice rather than broader economic conditions. Our findings provide direct evidence that prejudice can distort market outcomes by inducing targeted individuals to withdraw from interactions with prejudiced market participants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present the first large-scale field experiment test of strategic complementarities in firms’ technology adoption. Our experiment was embedded in a Bank of Italy survey covering around 3,000 firms. We elicited firms’ beliefs about competitors’ adoption of two advanced technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. We randomly provided half of the sample with accurate information about adoption rates. Most firms substantially underestimated competitors’ current adoption, and when provided with information, they updated their expectations about competitors’ future adoption. The information increased firms’ own intended future adoption of robotics, although we do not observe a significant effect on AI adoption. Our findings provide causal evidence on coordination in innovation and illustrate how information frictions shape technology diffusion.</content>

    <title>Patient Peer Effects: Evidence from Nursing Home Room Assignments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide causal evidence that patient peer effects generate mortality impacts comparable to provider quality differences. Drawing on administrative records covering 2.6 million stays (2000–2010) across 7,200 U.S. nursing homes, we exploit plausibly exogenous roommate assignments identified through unique room identifiers. We estimate that assignment to a roommate diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD), relative to placement in a private room, increases 90-day mortality by 2.1 percentage points (14% of baseline)—equivalent to receiving care at a nursing home one full standard deviation worse in quality. Effects differ sharply by patient type: patients with AD/ADRD benefit substantially from cognitively healthy roommates but not from private rooms, suggesting important peer monitoring and support roles. In contrast, mortality of patients without AD/ADRD does not depend on roommate cognitive health but is reduced in private rooms. A simple assignment rule exploiting this heterogeneity could reduce overall mortality by 0.8 percentage points without additional resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The FDA does not formally regulate representativeness, but if trials under-enroll vulnerable patients, the resulting evidence may understate harm from drugs. We study the relationship between trial participation and the risk of drug-induced adverse events for cancer medications using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program linked to Medicare claims. Initiating treatment with a cancer drug increases the risk of hospitalization due to serious adverse events (SAE) by 2 percentage points per month (a 250% increase). Heterogeneity in SAE treatment effects can be predicted by patient's comorbidities, frailty, and demographic characteristics. Patients at the 90th percentile of the risk distribution experience a 2.5 times greater increase in SAEs after treatment initiation compared to patients at the 10th percentile of the risk distribution yet are 4 times less likely to enroll in trials. The predicted SAE treatment effects for the drug's target population are 15% larger than the predicted SAE treatment effects for trial enrollees, corresponding to 1 additional induced SAE hospitalization for every 25 patients per year of treatment. We formalize conditions under which regulating representativeness of SAE risk will lead to more externally valid trials, and we discuss how our results could inform regulatory requirements.</content>

    <title>Lenin's Shadow on the Istanbul Convention: The Legacy of Communism on Attitudes Toward Violence Against Women in Europe</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Istanbul Convention is an international treaty aimed at protecting women against violence. We employ survey datasets and investigate its effect on attitudes toward violence against women in Europe. Using difference-in-differences models we compare individuals in countries that signed and ratified the Convention with those in countries that signed but either never ratified or did so after the surveys were fielded. Entry into the Convention significantly reduced the likelihood that lower-educated individuals view violence against women as acceptable, but only in countries outside the former Eastern Bloc. In former Eastern Bloc countries, the Convention affected attitudes only among younger less-educated individuals who had limited exposure to communism—those who were no older than teenagers when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990. We show that younger cohorts in these countries tend to hold more individualistic and less pro-government attitudes and express greater trust in the courts and the justice system than older individuals. Finally, we find no effect of the Convention on attitudes toward other forms of norm-violating behavior, such as tax evasion, bribery, fare evasion, or drug use. These results indicate that the Convention had a targeted impact, and that its influence on shaping preferences depends on the broader cultural context which is itself shaped by institutions.</content>

    <title>Overlapping Policy Interventions: Evidence from Home Health</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments often concurrently deploy multiple policy instruments to tackle a common objective, yet researchers typically analyze each policy's impacts independently. We study interactions across policies and their implications within the context of efforts to reduce Medicare-financed home health services. We consider two geographically targeted policies:  strike force prosecutions of suspected fraud and moratoria on the entry of new home health agencies. Depending on location and time, we observe either both, one, or neither policy in place. Individually, each policy reduced home health use substantially, and was well-targeted to places with higher treatment effects. Although we estimate only a modest interaction between the two policies, we find that optimally allocating them across the areas that received at least one policy could have increased their total impact by about 20% relative to the observed placement. Our exercise highlights the potential gains from coordination across different policy instruments pursuing similar objectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our analysis of novel data from hundreds of thousands of online auctions on a large platform operating in the Netherlands uncovers a tendency to bid round numbers. Round winning bids are higher than average for a given item and are eschewed by bidders as they gain experience. These findings lead us to hypothesize that, rather than delivering a strategic benefit (say, adding salience to a jump bid), round bidding is a symptom of a behavioral bias. We construct a structural model of behavioral bidding in auctions, estimated for each of a subsample of the most frequently auctioned items. Our median estimate is that 21% of bidders are prone to round-number bias, reducing their expected surplus by nearly 10%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines monthly earnings volatility and its transmission to household earnings volatility using Norwegian data on the universe of monthly pay histories. We document substantial month-to-month earnings changes: within a job, while over one-quarter of months have no earnings changes, another quarter have at least a 23% change. Accounting for multiple jobs and non-employment increases volatility, while aggregating to households reduces volatility by 12-35%. Event studies around job loss and couple formation, along with decomposition and bounding exercises, show that most of this decline reflects pooling effects rather than sorting or responses to shocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study sequentially evaluates a soft-skills course implemented in Ugandan and Kenyan primary schools that replaced academic review time with lessons on goal-setting and related skills as students prepared for high-stakes primary school-leaving exams. An exploratory evaluation in Uganda provided evidence of positive impacts on girls’ test scores. A confirmatory evaluation in Kenya found that the course led to improvements in self-reported soft skills, especially among girls, although no gains in test scores. The study illustrates the utility of sequential evaluation, with exploratory analysis to identify promising hypotheses, followed by out-of-sample testing, as a tool to uncover heterogeneous effects.</content>

    <title>The Role of Insurers in Health Care Spending and Production: Evidence from Utah</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private health insurers play a central role in determining the cost and quantity of health care in the United States. Despite this centrality, there has been limited empirical work studying how insurers differentially affect spending and consumption, especially for expensive and pervasive chronic conditions. We use hundreds of natural experiments involving employers switching their primary health insurer, together with a movers design, to estimate these causal effects. We find meaningful differences in total cost and prices for medical and pharmaceutical spending. Within-person changes in spending caused by forced reassignment across pairs of insurers, holding fixed plan generosity, are as large as 30% of total medical spending and 37% of drug spending. We also find substantial dispersion in insurer causal effects on health care spending and quantities for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions. We find strong evidence for drug offsets as insurers who causally increase drug utilization also reduce medical costs and quantities overall and by condition. Finally, we find that employers do not select plans that reduce costs for their employees based on the match between employee conditions and estimated plan treatment effects, leaving significant cost savings on the table.</content>

    <title>In-situ Upgrading or Population Relocation? Direct Impacts and Spatial Spillovers of Slum Renewal Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Slums are widely viewed as disadvantaged areas characterized by substandard housing and negative neighborhood spillovers that constrain local economic development. Governments typically respond with one of two place-based interventions: (a) in-situ upgrading that improves infrastructure and housing conditions within existing settlements, or (b) relocation of slum households to formal housing elsewhere in the city, freeing valuable urban land for alternative uses. We compare the direct effects and local spatial spillovers of these two approaches in Chile. We construct a 20-year national panel of slum polygons that integrates satellite imagery, census microdata, construction permits, administrative records, crime reports, and property-tax data. Using this dataset, we estimate how each policy affects the physical characteristics of slums and adjacent areas, and whether either intervention shifts the socioeconomic composition of residents. Our empirical strategy relies on Synthetic Difference-in-Differences for causal identification. We find that both policies reduce the share of land devoted to housing within the original slum perimeter — in-situ upgrading by reallocating land toward neighborhood infrastructure, and population relocation by reducing the number of slum households and housing structures. However, only in-situ upgrading generates durable improvements in housing quality and the socioeconomic status of residents. In addition, upgrading produces substantial positive spillovers in nearby neighborhoods, increasing formal housing investment and reducing crime. Moreover, administrative cost data show that in-situ upgrading is roughly one-third less expensive per household than population relocation, underscoring its greater cost-effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many socially desirable policies are not implemented because of their ex-ante unpopularity, but this unpopularity may be overcome through experience with the policy. In this paper, we examine how opposition to carbon pricing in the state of Washington turned into support after voters experienced a cap-and-trade policy with revenues earmarked for environmental purposes – "cap-and-invest." Analyzing voting behavior at the census block group level, we observe that support varies by political affiliation as expected, but experience consistently increases support across the board. Using a proprietary survey, we further show that the increase in support among voters in Washington state is specific to the cap-and invest policy they experienced; support for carbon pricing or climate policies more generally remained unchanged.</content>

    <title>Explaining the Widening Divides in US Midlife Mortality: Is There a Smoking Gun?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The education-mortality gradient has increased sharply in the last three decades, with the life-expectancy gap between people with and without a college degree widening from 2.6 years in 1992 to 6.3 years in 2019 (Case and Deaton 2023). During the same period, mortality inequality across counties rose 30 percent, accompanied by an increasing rural health penalty. Using county- and state-level data from the 1992–2019 period, we demonstrate that these three trends arose due to a fundamental shift in the geographic patterns of mortality among college and non-college populations. First, we find a sharp decline in both mortality rates and geographic inequality for college graduates. Second, the reverse was true for people without a college degree; spatial inequality became amplified. Third, we find that rates of smoking play a key role in explaining all three empirical puzzles, with secondary roles attributed to income, other health behaviors, and state policies. Less well-understood is why “place effects” matter so much for smoking (and mortality) for those without a college degree.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is income inequality in the United States primarily driven by disparities between ethnic groups or within them? The evidence reveals a striking pattern: 96% of U.S. income inequality arises from variation within groups sharing common ancestral origins, far overshadowing the comparatively small share attributable to differences between these groups. This pattern remains remarkably stable across time and regions.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Contemporaneous Air Pollution Exposure on Cognitive Performance in Kenya</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the short-term cognitive effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure using highly time-resolved, individual-level data collected during cognitive testing in Kenya. By linking real-time portable monitor readings to Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) scores, we identify acute impacts of pollution on general and domain-specific cognition. Higher PM2.5 exposure during testing is associated with lower cognitive performance, particularly in memory, executive function, and visuospatial tasks. Nonlinear models suggest threshold effects, with larger declines at higher exposure levels. Notably, effects are significantly larger among more educated individuals, possibly due to greater task demands or lower chronic exposure that limits physiological adaptation. Given that cognitive impairment is evident even at PM2.5 levels below Kenya’s annual regulatory threshold of 35 μg/m³, the findings suggest that short-term exposure may impose underappreciated human capital costs that current regulatory standards fail to mitigate. The results highlight the potential cognitive and economic returns to interventions that reduce air pollution exposures in low-resource settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inspections are a common tool for acquiring information and incentivizing compliance. Although inspections are typically unannounced, their timing often follows a predictable schedule. We study how this predictability shapes firm effort and patient outcomes in U.S. nursing homes, leveraging detailed administrative data on staffing, care, and health outcomes. Nursing homes "slack" in the low-risk period following an inspection and ramp up effort as their next inspection approaches. Patient survival mirrors this pattern, suggesting that these fluctuations in effort have meaningful consequences for the quality of patient care. We embed these estimates in a dynamic model capturing how inspection regimes incentivize effort and provide information about quality. Our estimates indicate that moving to unpredictable inspections could induce as much additional effort as increasing the frequency of inspections by 12%, while only minimally reducing their informational value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examined the heterogeneous impacts of social security reforms in Japan over the past 40 years. We utilize a nationwide large-scale micro-dataset to compute individual-level social security wealth (SSW) and mortality rates by lifetime earning groups. We found that SSW declined for all groups after the social security reforms, which aimed to reduce generosity; however, the size of the negative impact was larger for richer individuals. These results indicate that a series of recent social security reforms have reduced inequality in SSW.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the empirical properties of firm-level productivity and distortions across countries using the newly released World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES). Using a standard framework of production heterogeneity, I show that the gap in productivity and distortions between high and low productivity firms is larger in developing countries, generating large aggregate productivity losses from misallocation. A key empirical property of distortions in developing countries is that they systematically weaken the relationship between firm size and firm productivity. I exploit a unique feature of the WBES data to document which specific aspects of the economic environment faced by firms, such as financial constraints, regulation, corruption, and weak infrastructure, are consistent with the empirical pattern of distortions across countries.</content>

    <title>Antitrust Enforcement in Labor Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Until recently, antitrust laws were rarely enforced in labor markets. Although the existence of labor market power has long been recognized, evidence only recently emerged that such market power regularly arises from sources that are actionable under antitrust law. Since 2010, antitrust agencies have substantially increased labor market enforcement actions. However, many questions relevant to enforcement remain unanswered, such as how to conduct market definition for labor markets, and how best to incorporate concentration into models of the labor market. This article reviews how antitrust is beginning to be used in labor markets, the evidence for and against its use, and the remaining evidence gaps standing in the way of more effective use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Joint custody following divorce is widespread, but implementation is costly when individuals live in different states and so affects interstate mobility. Migration of separated fathers has fallen significantly more than that of married fathers. We show the causal effect of joint custody using two strategies. First, we survey separated parents to elicit beliefs about the likelihood of interstate moves. Second, we use the staggered adoption of joint custody laws across US states, and show a reduction in actual migration of 11 percentage points for fathers. For mothers, there is no impact on mobility but suggestive evidence of beneficial labor market outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the years, the Belgian social security system has undergone substantial reform with a prime focus on increasing older worker labor force participation. The paper explores the effect of past reforms on inequality in old age.  We distinguish two separate effects: The mechanical effect considers the change in inequality and expected benefit levels due to the reforms for a fixed retirement age distribution. The behavioral effect accounts for the endogenous change caused by changes in the incentives to work. Our results show that mechanically, reforms have led to losses in expected benefits for all but the lowest income quintile. Behavioral changes had a positive but orders of magnitude smaller effect. Overall, inequality decreased as a result of reforms.</content>

    <title>The State Pension Age and Inequality in Old-age Social Security Wealth in the Netherlands</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the early 2010s, the state pension age (SPA) is one of the main public policy instruments in the Netherlands for inducing people to postpone retirement. The SPA has gradually increased from 65 years in 2012 to 66 years and 4 months in 2021. In the context of the Dutch old-age social security system, an increase in the SPA is hypothesized to decrease the retirement probability and to increase inequality in pension benefits entitlements. Empirical support for the two hypotheses is found with data on individuals aged 55–69 over the period 2011-2021. Inequality in old-age social security wealth has increased after 2015 for non-retirees. However, the findings do not support that this increase is because of the SPA increase.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter studies social security reforms and trends in inequalities among older workers over the last decades in Spain. Its main goal is to analyze the redistributive impact of the various pension reforms on older income inequality. Compared to the rules in 1985, recent pension reforms have led to an average increase on Social Security Wealth of approximately 18,000€ for men and 15,000€ for women. This represents a ten and eight percent increase, respectively. This effect is mostly driven by the mechanical or direct effect (e.g. via benefit adjustments), while changes in retirement probability (secondary or behavioral effect) are close to zero. Furthermore, we find striking differences across income quartiles, for both men and women. In both cases, there is a clear income gradient, where the richest quartile has benefitted the most with an increase close to twenty percent, or over €50,000, for both men and women. Conversely, the change for the poorest income quartile for men and the two poorest income quartiles for women is close to zero or even slightly negative. This is likely due to the effect of minimum benefits (that mark the generosity of the system, see Boldrin et al, 1999) that automatically absorb any other effect for low-income individuals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study analyzes the distributional effects of French pension reforms from 1993 to 2014 across different socioeconomic groups. Using administrative data for individuals born between 1934 and 1950, we examine the impact on social security wealth (SSW) across lifetime earnings deciles and genders. Our methodology incorporates differential life expectancy and exploits the PENSIPP model for counterfactual scenarios. Results show that reforms generally decreased SSW across all income groups, with regressive tendencies. The 1993 reform had the most significant impact, reducing SSW by over 15% for men in the lowest earnings decile compared to 5% for the highest. Subsequent reforms had milder effects. These findings contribute to understanding the long-term consequences of pension reforms on inequality and inform future policy decisions in countries facing similar demographic challenges.</content>

    <title>Financializing the Professions: The Rise of Private Equity in Accounting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private equity (PE) has moved rapidly into professional services, yet its impact on accounting, where licensing regimes, reputational capital, and partnership governance traditionally limit external ownership, remains poorly understood. We examine how PE ownership alters the organization and market structure of accounting firms using data from 1999-2024 that link more than 3,600 PE transactions to detailed information on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), labor markets, and audit pricing. PE investment increases sharply after 2020 and extends to both CPA-licensed audit firms and non-CPA advisory practices, with most activity in large mid-tier PCAOB-registered firms. After PE entry, firms grow faster: non-audit revenues rise, employment expands, and cross-state M&amp;A accelerates, consistent with platform-building and consolidation. These adjustments have market-level implications. PE investment raises labor-market concentration in key accounting occupations and drives up ERISA audit fees in a standardized setting, as confirmed by a synthetic difference-in-differences design. Our results reveal a key tension at the core of professions: preserving independence and competition in a market increasingly driven by financial capital.</content>

    <title>Default and Interest Rate Shocks: Renegotiation Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a sovereign default model with debt renegotiation in which interest-rate shocks affect default incentives through two mechanisms. Under the standard mechanism, higher interest rates tighten the government’s budget constraint. Under the renegotiation mechanism, higher rates increase lenders’ opportunity cost of holding delinquent debt, which makes lenders accept larger haircuts and makes default more attractive for the government. We argue that our novel renegotiation mechanism reconciles standard sovereign default models with the narrative that the sharp increase in the real interest rate in the United States was a relevant factor in the defaults of the early 1980s.</content>

    <title>Long-run Effects of Universal Pre-Primary Education Expansion: Evidence from Argentina</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the long-run effects of a large public expansion of pre-primary education in Argentina. Between 1993 and 1999 the federal government financed the construction of new preschool classrooms targeted to departments with low base- line enrollment and high poverty, creating roughly 186,000 additional places. We link administrative records on classroom construction to four population censuses and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare treated and untreated cohorts across high- and low-construction departments. An additional preschool seat per child increases post-kindergarten schooling by about 0.5 years, raising the probability of completing secondary school by 11.9 percentage points and of enrolling in post-secondary education by 7.1 percentage points. For women, access to the program also reduces completed fertility: an additional seat lowers the number of live births per woman by 0.18, and we find no evidence that selective migration biases these estimates. We find little impact on labor-market outcomes at the census date, consistent with beneficiaries still being in school or in the early stages of their careers. A benefit-cost analysis based on the estimated schooling gains, standard Mincer returns, and observed construction and operating costs yields a benefit-cost ratio of about 11 and an internal rate of return of 13%. Our findings show that universal at-scale pre-primary expansions in middle-income countries can generate sizable improvements in human capital and demographic outcomes at relatively low fiscal cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper links globalization, worker efficiency, and wage inequality within plants to internal labor market organization. Using German plant-worker data and information on the task content of occupations, we document that larger plants (i) use more occupations, (ii) assign fewer tasks per occupation, and (iii) exhibit greater wage dispersion. We develop a model where plants endogenously bundle tasks into occupations, improving worker-task matching at the cost of higher fixed span-of-control costs. Embedding this into a Melitz framework, we show that trade increases worker efficiency and wage inequality in exporting plants, whereas non-exporting plants experience the opposite effects. Structural estimation and simulations confirm the model’s predictions and point to non-monotonic economy-wide effects.</content>

    <title>The Consequences of Abortion Funding Bans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do restrictions on public funding create unintended reliance on social assistance? In this paper, we study the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which barred federal funding for abortion. Using county-level data and an event-study design, we show that reduced federal funding for abortion increased fertility among young women by 2%. These effects were concentrated among non-white women, who subsequently experienced greater welfare participation in states with larger abortion funding declines. The consequences extend into the next generation: non-white girls born after Hyde were more likely to rely on public assistance in adulthood. Abortion funding restrictions reinforce long-run economic inequality across generations.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Online Sales Bans on E-Cigarette Use</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policymakers at the state and federal levels have argued that restricting online sales of e-cigarettes is a crucial policy tool to curb youth vaping. This study is the first to explore the effectiveness of statewide restrictions on online sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) on teen and young adult ENDS use. Using data from four national datasets (Monitoring the Future, State and Combined Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System surveys, Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey) and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find no evidence that such laws are effective at curbing youth ENDS use. With 95 percent confidence, we can rule out that online sales restrictions reduced prior-month ENDS use by more than 3.6 percent of the pre-treatment mean vaping rate. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that (1) while restrictions on online sales may have a small negative effect on online purchases, youths are able to substitute to other sources for ENDS products to compensate for reduced online access, and (2) online sources are a very rare source of e-cigarettes for youths. Finally, we also find no evidence that online sales restrictions reduce adult ENDS use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a large-scale information randomized controlled trial to study fiscal policy impacts. Surveying approximately 9,000 households across five eurozone countries with varying debt-to-GDP ratios enables a clean cross-country comparison. The key finding is that the fiscal multiplier depends jointly on the financing method and the country’s debt burden: multipliers are smaller in high-debt countries when debt-financed but remain similar across countries when tax-financed. Finally, we develop a New Keynesian model featuring fiscal discipline, which reproduces the empirical patterns observed in the survey and highlights their underlying economic mechanisms.</content>

    <title>The Labor Market and Health Impacts of Reducing Cesarean Section Deliveries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in three births in the United States is delivered by cesarean section (c-section). This paper studies the labor market and health effects of c-sections, using newly linked administrative data that combines the universe of California birth records with mothers’ quarterly earnings. We analyze the impact of an intervention that reduced c-section rates among low-risk first-time births, and find that mothers exposed to the intervention appear to have a higher likelihood of employment in the quarter following birth, as well as a higher likelihood of returning to their pre-birth employer. These impacts attenuate over time—suggesting that a c-section primarily delays return to the labor market following childbirth—but attachment to the pre-birth employer remains higher five quarters post-birth. We find no evidence of significant impacts on maternal or infant health, indicating that the intervention-induced decline in c-sections did not come at the cost of worse outcomes. Further, among mothers who have another child, we find that exposure to the intervention at the first birth leads to a lower likelihood of c-section and preterm delivery at the second one, implying that both the economic and health benefits of reduced c-sections may compound with birth order.</content>

    <title>Medium-Term Impacts of Integrated Social Safety Nets: Cash Transfers, Information Meetings, and Home Visits for Child Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cash transfers are a critical part of social safety nets. However, integrated programs combining cash and parenting interventions through either group-based information meetings or home visits are recently being adopted to improve child development. Working with the Burkina Faso government, we conduct a randomized experiment in 225 rural villages to assess the impact of an integrated social safety net over the child’s life cycle. Villages were randomized to a control group or one of the following treatments: cash transfers; cash transfers plus government-run group-based information meetings focused on children’s health and psychosocial development; or cash transfers, information, and home visits reinforcing the information meetings. Fifteen months after treatment ended, households receiving cash, information, and home visits have fewer pregnancies, more medically assisted childbirths, enhanced health behaviors, and better educational outcomes. Adding home visits is essential for improving childhood development, while cash, with or without information, produces no lasting impacts.</content>

    <title>Examining the Effect of Cannabis Legalization on Youth Cannabis Use: Evidence on the Importance of Enforcing Retailer Compliance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies show that U.S. state cannabis legalization has increased adult cannabis use, but the effects on youth use are mixed. This study considers whether omission of enforcement of the minimum legal sales age (MLSA) might help explain prior mixed findings. We combine biennial survey data for 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students from the 2010-2023 Washington Healthy Youth Survey with administrative data on premise and compliance checks from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB). Premise checks educate retailers on any potential violations but do not involve penalties or fines. Compliance checks, on the other hand, involve increasing penalties imposed on retailers if they are found to be noncompliant with sales to minors. We use difference-in-differences (DID) methods that are robust to a staggered policy rollout with dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects and assess impacts of both types of inspections on past month cannabis use. We conduct a series of sensitivity and robustness checks of the impact of both types of inspections based on student’s grade, length of time since inspection, inclusion of alcohol/tobacco retail compliance checks, and alternative measures of cannabis use. Our research suggests that the implementation of regular random compliance checks with stiff penalties on retailers for noncompliance may help reduce the influence of legal markets on youth use. Unobserved heterogeneity within and across states in the enforcement of MLSAs may contribute to mixed findings of the impact of legalization on youth cannabis use.</content>

    <title>Electoral Margins and Political Competition</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we argue that recent trends in party seat margins and election vote margins result from structural changes in the nature of US political competition. We assemble a comprehensive database of electoral results for the House, Senate and presidential contests, from the 19th century until today. Seat margins declined in the recent period, so the margins of control of the House, Senate, and Electoral College by either party have become smaller. However, this was not accompanied by a decline in the margins of victory at the constituency level. We propose a model of electoral competition with multiple districts that can rationalize these trends. We show theoretically that an increase in politicians’ information about voter preferences, together with the growing nationalization of politics, can account for the decrease in seat margins and the concurrent stability in vote margins. As implied by the model, we document that campaign contributions received by House and Senate candidates are increasingly concentrated in a dwindling set of swing constituencies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Export activity shapes workers’ experience-wage profiles. Using employer-employee and customs data for Brazilian manufacturing, we document that workers' experience wage profiles are steeper at exporters than at non-exporters and, among exporters, steeper at exporters shipping to high-income destinations. We develop and quantify a model featuring worker-firm wage bargaining, export-market entry by multi-worker firms, and human capital accumulation by workers to interpret the data. Human capital growth can explain one-half of the differences in wage profiles between exporters and non-exporters. We show that increased human capital per worker can account for one-half of the overall gains in real income from trade openness.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Dynamic Prices on Electric Vehicle Public Charging Demand: Evidence from a Nationwide Natural Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding how to effectively influence electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior is critical for managing electricity grids powered by high levels of variable renewable generation. We present results from a large-scale natural field experiment conducted in the United Kingdom, involving approximately 110,000 EV customers and 60% of the country’s public charging infrastructure. Within this network, we applied a price decrease to approximately one-fifth of chargers to bring their prices closer to the marginal cost of electricity in low-cost hours in Great Britain. Customers were randomly assigned to different price levels, allowing us to estimate the causal effect of price on charging demand and derive elasticities of short-run behavioral responses. Customers were highly responsive to price: a 40% reduction in charging costs increased platform-wide charging activity by 117%, while a 15% price cut led to a 30% increase. Decomposing the increase in charging, we estimate that approximately half reflected substitution between charging apps. Our findings suggest that dynamic pricing for public EV charging generated large consumer welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Sources of Evidence for Evidence-based Policymaking: Journals, Articles and Scholarly Structures in the Economic Report of the President 2010-2025</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does academic research inform presidential economic policy? This paper investigates the sources of evidence in the Economic Report of the President from 2010 to 2025. We construct a novel dataset of 4,140 unique references cited across the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations to map the evidence base used by the Council of Economic Advisers. Our analysis shows that peer-reviewed articles, comprising 66.62% of all these references, are heavily concentrated in top-tier economics journals. While the specific articles cited change with policy priorities, the hierarchy of journals remains moderately stable across years and administrations. A co-author network analysis reveals a scholarly landscape of distinct intellectual camps. Crucially, a small number of high-centrality scholars act as brokers, connecting these disparate research communities. Together, our findings illuminate the social structure of evidence-based policymaking, demonstrating how journal hierarchies and scholarly networks shape the flow of economic knowledge to the White House.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Survey mode is a critical consideration in well-being research using the 22 country Global Flourishing Study (GFS).  We find marked differences in responses to well-being questions if they are obtained via a telephone interviewer (CATI) or online (CAWI).  In fifteen countries in the GFS both survey modes are used.  In seven of the most advanced countries, only CAWI is used.  Well-being responses are markedly different across survey modes within countries using both modes and compared to countries only using CAWI.  On average, CATI tends to produce higher well-being scores.  Failure to account for these sampling differences biases results.  This is the case in twenty-three prior studies that used the GFS and took no account of survey mode.  We examine each of these studies and show the findings differ by survey mode.  Combined with the presence of other unobservable country-level confounders, the differences between survey modes substantively weakens the internal validity of cross-country comparisons and random effects meta-analysis conducted with the GFS.</content>

    <title>Volatile Rates, Fragile Growth: Global Financial Risk and Productivity Dynamics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that rising volatility in U.S. interest rates, a key dimension of global financial risk, notably depresses the trend of economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs) but not in advanced economies (AEs). Using a panel state-space model, we show that a one standard- deviation shock to U.S. monetary policy uncertainty permanently lowers the level of GDP in EMEs by about 25 basis points after three years, with negligible effects in AEs. We rationalize this fact in a small open economy model where firms borrow against future profits to finance innovation. Higher volatility compresses firm values, tightens collateral constraints, and endogenously slows productivity growth, especially when financial frictions are severe.</content>

    <title>The Rise of Specialized Financial Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The variety of financial products available for firms to raise funds has expanded rapidly in recent decades. This paper studies the role of innovations that introduce specialized financial products using a combination of granular data and a parsimonious model of security issuance. We present three key findings. First, differential product adoption across firms explains most of the observed variation in the amounts of funds raised. Second, firms that adopt new products are more successful in raising funds. Third, the funds raised from new financial products are often sourced from numerous highly specialized products, each used by only a few firms.</content>

    <title>Patents to Products: Product Innovation and Firm Dynamics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We match patents to products using natural language methods applied to detailed product descriptions and patent texts in the consumer goods sector. While more than half of product innovations originate from non-patenting firms, patent filings are on average followed by subsequent product introductions. Yet this relationship weakens with firm size. Patents held by market leaders also yield revenue premiums beyond what can be explained by their own product introductions and are associated with stronger deterrence of competitors’ innovations. To interpret these findings, we develop a simple growth model in which larger firms have stronger incentives to engage in strategic patenting—filing for protection rather than market innovation—which dampens innovation and slows creative destruction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In sorting literature, comparative statics for multidimensional assignment models with general output functions and input distributions is an important open question. We provide a complete theory of comparative statics for technological change in general multidimensional assignment models. Our main result is that any technological change is uniquely decomposed into two distinct components. The first component (gradient) gives a characterization of changes in marginal earnings through a Poisson equation. The second component (divergence-free) gives a characterization of labor reallocation. For U.S. data, we quantify equilibrium responses in sorting and earnings with respect to cognitive skill-biased technological change.</content>

    <title>Identity and Ideology in the School Boardroom</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School boards have statutory authority over most elementary and secondary education policies, but receive little attention compared to other actors in education systems. A fundamental challenge to understanding the importance of boards is the absence of data on the policy goals of board members—i.e., their ideologies—forcing researchers to conduct tests based on demographic and professional characteristics—i.e., identities—with which ideology is presumed to correlate. This paper uses new data on the viewpoints and policy actions of school board members, coupled with a regression discontinuity design that generates quasi-random variation in board composition, to establish two results. The first is that the priorities of board members have large causal effects across many domains. For example, the effect of electing an equity-focused board member on test scores for low-income students is roughly equivalent to assigning every such student a teacher who is 0.3 to 0.4 SDs higher in the distribution of teacher value-added. The second is that observing policy priorities is crucial. Identity turns out to be a poor proxy for ideology, with limited governance effects that are fully explained by differences in policy priorities. Our findings challenge the belief that school boards are unimportant, showing that who serves on the board and what they prioritize can have far-reaching consequences for students.</content>

    <title>Understanding the Employment Effects of Opportunity Zones</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Opportunity Zone program was designed to encourage investment in distressed communities across the United States. Early research found no evidence of impacts of the program on employment, earnings, or poverty of zone residents, but some evidence of positive effects on employment among businesses in zones. Using the latest survey-based as well as administrative data, we adopt a longer-run and more comprehensive perspective on the labor market impacts of OZs. We find that OZ designation increases job creation among businesses within zones. However, a large share of the newly created jobs in zones is offset by declines in nearby low-income communities. While we detect gains in OZ resident employment over the longer run, the increase comes from jobs with workplaces outside of OZs that, in light of the changing demographic composition of zones, are likely held by new as opposed to existing residents. Overall, our results suggest that OZs have limited benefits for existing residents of targeted areas and are associated mainly with a spatial reallocation of jobs and households.</content>

    <title>How Good is International Risk Sharing? Stepping Outside the Shadow of the Welfare Theorems</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit whether global output is (Pareto) efficiently distributed across countries over time. The efficient allocation of goods across regions requires that the relative marginal utilities of consumption across countries comoves with the relative costs of the country-specific consumption bundles.  Standard approaches to evaluating this property exploit the Welfare Theorems and equate the observed real exchange rate with the social relative costs of consumption.  Given the large literature documenting the disconnect between exchange rates, relative prices faced by consumers in a given market, and relative quantities consumed, we develop a methodology that measures relative costs that is robust to this disconnect.  We find that relative consumption growth across regions is significantly more correlated with our computed shadow prices than it is with observed real exchange rates, suggesting an allocation closer to efficient risk sharing.  Moreover, we provide a decentralization that matches observed prices and quantities, enabling us to rationalize the better implied risk sharing with the failure of the standard correlations.  The decentralization involves a combination of segmented foreign exchange markets and pricing-to-market behavior in goods markets.  The model implies that consumption allocations are insulated from excess fluctuations in the exchange rate via the equilibrium pricing behavior of exporters.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the potential of pro-development state (capacity) building projects to be coopted for repression. I leverage the natural experiment created by the differential build-up of capacity between formerly Prussian and formerly non-Prussian parts of unified Germany, and the radical policy shifts instigated by the Nazi regime. Across a geographical discontinuity, and across different stops of the same train transport to the East, I find that Prussian municipalities were significantly more efficient at deporting Germany's Jews. They were also better at providing public goods and at collecting taxes. Just before the Nazis came to power, Prussian municipalities also provided public goods more efficiently, but were not differentially involved with anti-Semitism. I show that democratic oversight and aspects of bureaucratic culture can mitigate the potential for future abuse of state building projects.</content>

    <title>Elections and Political Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Elections select officeholders and policies, but they also signal to political actors where to invest their time and money. This paper presents a framework for understanding these effects, in which political investors (e.g., donors, activists) allocate resources where expected political fundamentals favor their party. Investors possess idiosyncratic local knowledge but also public information in the form of recent election results. These signals are complementary: where local knowledge is good, even the narrowest vote-share majorities can align beliefs and concentrate investment. I apply this framework to the changing political geography of the United States between 1940 and 1972, when urban and minority areas came into play for the Democratic Party. A regression discontinuity design based on close presidential elections shows that counties narrowly won by Democrats saw pronounced increases in Democratic local officeholding and voter support in subsequent election periods. This does not reflect direct impacts of presidential elections on local offices, but rather indirect shifts through political investment, including heightened activity in newspaper advertising, phone banking, and civil rights mobilization. Effects are concentrated in urban, Black, and union areas where dense organizational networks enhanced local political knowledge. Together, the findings show how elections organize political actors not only at the ballot box but through the information they convey.</content>

    <title>Learning and the Emergence of Nonlinearity in Financial Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial markets (and more generally the real economy) display a wide range of important nonlinearities. This paper focuses on stock returns, which are skewed
left – generating crashes – and whose volatility moves over time, is itself skewed, is strongly related to the level of prices, and displays long memory. This paper shows that such behavior is almost inevitable when prices are formed by investors acquiring information about the true, but latent, value of stocks. It studies a general model of filtering in which agents receive signals about the fundamental value of the stock market and dynamically update their beliefs (potentially with biases). When those beliefs are non-normal and investors believe crashes can happen, prices generically display the range of nonlinearities observed in the data. While the model does not explain where crashes come from, it shows that investors believing that prices can crash is sufficient to generate the rich higher-order dynamics observed empirically. In a simple calibration with iid shocks to fundamentals, the model fits well quantitatively, and regression-based tests support the model’s mechanism.</content>

    <title>What Would it Cost to End Extreme Poverty?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study poverty minimization via direct transfers, framing this as a statistical learning problem while retaining the information constraints faced by real-world programs. Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world’s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income. Extrapolated globally, the results correspond to a cost of (approximately) ending extreme poverty of roughly 0.3% of global GDP.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We offer guidance and tools for augmenting macroeconomic models with a realistic friction in expectations and for quantifying its implications. We start by distilling the common essence of a few popular alternatives to FIRE (Full Information Rational Expectations), including noisy or sticky information, rational or behavioral inattention, level-k thinking and cognitive discounting. We then develop a new specification, which captures the same essence while maximizing tractability. We show how this works in both RANK (the Representative-Agent New Keynesian model) and HANK (Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models). We further clarify the separate partial- and general-equilibrium effects of informational frictions or bounded rationality; emphasize the interaction of such frictions with the Intertemporal Keynesian Cross and other forms of strategic complementarity; review concrete lessons for business cycles and macroeconomic policy; and discuss how to discipline the theory with appropriate survey evidence.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that in long-term consumer–producer relationships, menus of contracts can often be advantageously replaced by a single generous contract such that, at any point in time, a consumer’s cumulative transfers equal the cumulative transfers they would have made under the contract that would have been best for them in hindsight. Such generous long-term contracts can increase skeptical consumers’ demand for complex and higher-powered contracts while approximately implementing the same outcomes as the underlying menu evaluated by a rational decision maker. Applications include voluntary load shedding in retail electricity markets and cost sharing in health insurance.</content>

    <title>Rebuilding Ukraine's Cities: Maximizing Benefits and Minimizing Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper discusses the rebuilding of Ukrainian cities. We start by outlining key facts about Ukraine and its cities: (i) the country’s population is declining; (ii) there is a shift in demand for housing from east to west; (iii) Kyiv’s advantage is growing; (iv) house prices are rising in Kyiv and western cities, (v) Ukraine’s cities are slow and congested. We then present a theoretical framework for maximizing the benefits of Ukraine’s rebuilding effort to highlight the welfare effects of different allocations of post-war infrastructure. Finally, we consider the cost curve for reconstruction, as determined, in particular, by the cost of materials, labor, the industrial organization of the building industry and public practices in procurement and regulation. We highlight three broad strategies for shifting the cost curve: openness, standardization and investing-in-investing. We conclude by outlining areas for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What explains the dramatic differences in earnings across locations? We employ an administrative employer-employee linked dataset from Italy that includes the country’s entire workforce to estimate firm-worker or location-worker effects. We also estimate differences in human capital accumulation across firms and cities. We find that the elasticity of the location premia to density is smaller than in other settings and that other locational characteristics, such as segregation in school or the workplace and inter-generational mobility, are more strongly correlated with earnings and earnings growth. Our place-based estimates are similar if we focus on movers who were forced to relocate after the L’Aquila Earthquake. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that density levels jump up at the historic border between House of Savoy-ruled Piedmont and the Hapsburg Empire. Earnings today also jump at the border. This finding suggests that there may be some unintended effects of being a far-flung province of a distant empire, perhaps because of access to larger markets or the administrative and educational reforms that began under Empress Maria Theresa.</content>

    <title>Who Chooses and Who Benefits? The Design of Public School Choice Systems</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Christopher Campos, Jesse Bruhn, Eric Chyn &amp; Antonia Vazquez</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public school choice has evolved rapidly in the past two decades, as districts roll out new magnet, dual-language, and themed programs to broaden educational opportunity. We use newly collected national data to document that opt-in (voluntary) systems: (i) are the modal design; (ii) are harder to navigate; and (iii) have participation that is concentrated among more advantaged students. These facts suggest a striking inconsistency: districts have largely adopted centralized assignment algorithms to broaden access, but most rely on optional participation that fragments public education. We study the implications of this design choice in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest opt-in system in the country, combining nearly two decades of administrative data, randomized lotteries, and quasi-experimental expansions in access. Participation is highly selective, consistent with national evidence, and lottery estimates suggest that the students with the lowest demand for choice schools are the ones who gain the most from attending. Opt-in participation therefore embeds a selection mechanism that screens out high-return students and leaves many effective programs with unused capacity. To evaluate system-level implications, we estimate a structural model linking applications, enrollment, and achievement. Choice schools are vertically differentiated and generate meaningful gains, but the opt-in participation rule—through high application costs and negative selection on gains—prevents these benefits from reaching the students who need them most. Counterfactual simulations make the design stakes clear: information and travel-cost reductions have limited effects, whereas reforms that change the participation architecture eliminate core inefficiencies and deliver the largest district-wide achievement gains. These results underscore that system design— not school effectiveness alone—shapes who benefits from public school choice and to what extent.</content>

    <title>Worker Preparedness Across the Marshallian Runs Survey Instruments and Early Evidence from the Copenhagen Life Panel</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Worker preparedness is a missing transmission channel in macroeconomics. Alfred Marshall’s taxonomy of short-, medium-, and long-run adjustment was developed to analyse how firms respond to shocks when different inputs can or cannot adjust. We extend this logic to workers by adding an element Marshall’s framework leaves implicit: anticipation. Preparedness refers to the buffers, search strategies, fallback plans, and retraining intentions individuals form before disruption occurs. These forward-looking margins shape both microeconomic outcomes and the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy.
The registry-linked Copenhagen Life Panel (CLP) provides a data architecture for making preparedness observable. By embedding belief and strategy elicitation within administrative records, the CLP makes it possible to test whether workers’ expectations and contingency plans are calibrated to the risks they face. Early evidence shows that short-run preparedness—liquidity, earnings-risk beliefs, and separation expectations—is measurable and predictive, and that miscalibration is a key source of vulnerability.
The broader agenda is to measure preparedness across Marshallian runs and across the worker life cycle. In the medium run, adjustment depends on search strategies and fallback planning; in the long run, retraining and occupational reorientation determine whether technological disruption becomes renewal or decline. We outline survey instruments for each run that can be integrated with registry data, transforming preparedness from conjecture into measurable and model-ready constructs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian literature has revisited the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy to consumption using models where heterogeneous households face idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints. We show that the key lessons from this literature also apply to investment using a model where heterogeneous firms face idiosyncratic productivity risk and financial frictions: constrained firms’ investment depends on their free cash flow, generating indirect effects of monetary policy and implying that transfer payments stimulate investment demand. Quantitatively, the strength of these new mechanisms is governed by firms’ marginal propensities to invest (MPIs), similar to the role of marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) for households. But unlike MPCs, we currently lack quasi-experimental evidence about MPIs that we can use to directly discipline the new mechanisms.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Spousal Social Security Claiming Decisions on the Financial Shock of Widowhood</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents evidence suggesting that delayed Social Security claiming by husbands – resulting in an actuarially enhanced benefit – attenuates the financial shock of widowhood for their wives. Under Social Security survivor benefit rules, primary earners (usually husbands) pass on the actuarial adjustments from delayed claiming to their surviving spouses. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, I find women whose husbands delayed claiming to full retirement age or later face a post-widowhood increase of 6.9 percentage points in the probability of falling below the 5th percentile of the pre-widowhood income distribution. This effect is almost 12 percent smaller for each year of delayed claiming by the husband (though the attenuation is concentrated in the first 4 years of widowhood). The general findings are robust to instrumenting for the husband’s claiming age using the loosening of the retirement earnings test in 2000 – a policy change that incentivized earlier claiming.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure benefits to households from Mumbai’s new Metro rail system. We estimate a commute mode choice model to value commute time savings in the short run and a housing choice model to value the improved commuting utility that households experience due to spatial sorting. Aggregate benefits from Metro rail are over 10 times higher when spatial sorting occurs. In the short run women, college-educated workers, and workers with above median incomes experience higher benefits than their opposites. In the long run, households with lower incomes and assets and less than college education benefit more than their wealthier counterparts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the introduction of the first antibiotic therapies in 1937 to examine the long-run effects of early-childhood pneumonia on adult educational attainment, employment, income, and work-related disability. Using census data, we document large average improvements across all outcomes, alongside substantial heterogeneity by gender and race. Among women, health gains led to changes in marriage and fertility that partially offset their labor market improvements. Among Black Americans, we uncover a pronounced gradient linked to systemic racial discrimination in the pre–Civil Rights era: individuals born in more discriminatory Jim Crow states realized much smaller gains than those born in less discriminatory states, despite larger reductions in pneumonia exposure. There is no similar gradient among white Americans. Together, these findings highlight the central role of institutional environments in shaping whether investments in early-life health translate into long-run socioeconomic gains.</content>

    <title>Women's Power in the Household</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine women's household power in low- and middle-income countries, synthesizing theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence on its measurement, determinants, and consequences. We define women's household power as their influence over household choices, distinguishing it from broader empowerment concepts. We review economic models, including unitary, collective, and bargaining frameworks, and map these to empirical approaches. We then discuss measurement methods  such as structural estimation of consumption allocation, survey measures, and laboratory experiments. On the determinants of women's power, we find that some approaches, such as transfers targeted to women, show mixed results, while others, such as increasing women's control over their earnings, show clearer positive impacts. On the effects of women's power, we pay special attention to children's human capital. Few studies provide strong evidence that mothers invest more in children than fathers do, but collectively the evidence suggests such an effect. We conclude by highlighting research and methodological gaps.</content>

    <title>Connected for Better or Worse? The Role of Production Networks in Financial Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how production networks shape the severity of Sudden Stops. We build a small open economy model with collateral constraints and input–output linkages, derive a sufficient statistic that maps network structure into the amplification of tradable shocks, and show that a planner optimally introduces sectoral wedges to reduce amplification. Using OECD input–output data and Sudden Stop episodes, we document systematic network differences between emerging and advanced economies and show they predict crisis severity. A calibrated three-sector DSGE model disciplined by these differences reveals that endowing an advanced economy with an emerging-market production network moves most of the way toward the observed emerging–advanced Sudden Stop gap.</content>

    <title>Open Devices and Slices: Evidence From Wi-Fi Equipment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study examines the quasi-natural experiments provided by the staggered introduction of open drivers in the supply chains for routers. It is rare to observe components become open and measure whether openness generates a statistical impact on more products and innovative products. This study collects novel data on all routers and subcomponents introduced between 2000 and 2018, characterizing each firm's position in a supply chain as either an upstream component provider or a downstream router assembler. Following prior literature, openness influences a firm's ability to negotiate with current and potential partners, which is labeled as autonomy. Evidence suggests that openness enhances supplier autonomy, increases the introduction of new products, and leads to a greater number of products located closer to the technical frontier. These estimates suggest that openness increased product introductions by enlarging the options available to component suppliers. The largest component suppliers benefited from greater sales, and no evidence indicates that openness aided entrants, small firms, or assemblers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital is central to efforts to promote growth, convergence, and the elimination of poverty. Drawing on the seminal macroeconomic frameworks by Nelson-Phelps, Lucas and subsequent developments, alongside macro and microeconomic evidence, we examine the role of human capital in driving innovation and growth. We highlight how different types of human capital, characterized by education level, matter in different stages of development. Despite documented increases in years of schooling, the world’s poorest regions still see stagnating outcomes in learning and education quality, potentially creating poverty traps where investments in neither physical nor human capital materialize. We discuss obstacles to human capital accumulation through a simple analytical framework and present evidence from randomized interventions spanning early childhood programs to school-age initiatives, assessing policies that can effectively remove barriers to skill acquisition and establish foundations for sustained growth.</content>

    <title>The Emerging Market for Intelligence: Pricing, Supply, and Demand for LLMs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document six facts about the structure and dynamics of the LLM market using API usage data from OpenRouter and Microsoft Azure. First, we show rapid growth in the number of models, creators, and inference providers, driven by open-source entrants. Second, we show price declines and persistent price heterogeneity across and within intelligence tiers, with open-source models being 90% cheaper than comparable closed-source models of the same intelligence. Third, we document market dynamism, with frequent turnover among leading models and creators. Fourth, we present evidence of horizontal and vertical differentiation, with no single model dominating across use cases, and demand for intelligence varying widely across applications. Fifth, we estimate preliminary short-run price elasticities just above one, suggesting limited scope for Jevons-Paradox effects. Finally, we show that although the share of firms that use multiple models increased over time, most firms concentrate their use on a single model, consistent with experimentation rather than persistent reliance on multiple models.</content>
