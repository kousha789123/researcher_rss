    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Structural economic models, while parsimonious and interpretable, often exhibit poor data fit and limited forecasting performance. Machine learning models, by contrast, offer substantial flexibility but are prone to overfitting and weak out-of-distribution generalization. We propose a theory-guided transfer learning framework that integrates structural restrictions from economic theory into machine learning models. The approach pre-trains a neural network on synthetic data generated by a structural model and then fine-tunes it using empirical data, allowing potentially misspecified economic restrictions to inform and regularize learning on empirical data. Applied to option pricing, our model substantially outperforms both structural and purely data-driven benchmarks, with especially large gains in small samples, under unstable market conditions, and when model misspecification is limited. Beyond performance, the framework provides diagnostics for improving structural models and introduces a new model-comparison metric based on data-model complementarity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial Technology (“FinTech”) firms invest significantly more in customer capital relative to traditional financial firms, and such investment builds valuable customer capital. Higher investment by FinTech firms is not accounted for by sectoral focus or differences in firm age. Reasons for higher customer capital investment are explored, including the need to build trust with customers, the focus on downstream segments of the financial marketplace, the operation of platform-based business models, and a heavier reliance on valuable customer data.</content>

    <title>AI in Charge: Large-Scale Experimental Evidence on Electric Vehicle Charging Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the promising opportunities offered by AI to support the decarbonization of electricity grids is to align demand with low-carbon supply. We evaluated the effects of one of the world’s largest AI managed EV charging tariffs (a retail electricity pricing plan) using a large-scale natural field experiment. The tariff dynamically controlled vehicle charging to follow real-time wholesale electricity prices and coordinate and optimize charging for the grid and the consumer through AI. We randomized financial incentives to encourage enrollment onto the tariff. Over more than a year, we found that the tariff led to a 42% reduction in household electricity demand during peak hours, with 100% of this demand shifted to lower-cost and lower-carbon-intensity periods. The tariff generated substantial consumer savings, while demonstrating potential to lower producer costs, energy system costs, and carbon emissions through significant load shifting. Overrides of the AI algorithm were low, suggesting that this tariff was likely more efficient than a real-time-pricing tariff without AI, given our theoretical framework. We found similar plug-in and override behavior in several markets, including the UK, US, Germany, and Spain, implying the potential for comparable demand and welfare effects. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable AI managed charging and its substantial welfare gains for the electricity system and society. We also show that experimental estimates differed meaningfully from those obtained via non-randomized difference-in-differences analysis, due to differences in the samples in the two evaluation strategies, although we can reconcile the estimates with observables.</content>

    <title>Pricing Residential Mortgage Credit Risk in the Post-GFC Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), the Credit Risk Transfer (CRT) bond market emerged as a new asset class in U.S.  mortgage market. We develop an asset pricing framework for CRTs consistent with Treasury, corporate bond, and housing markets. Our analysis reveals that the Government-Sponsored Enterprises compensate investors approximately fairly on average, though they overpay for low-risk tranches and underpay for high-risk ones. Additionally, the post-GFC guarantee fee increases broadly align with underlying credit risk. We find significant reverse cross-subsidization, where high-credit-risk borrowers subsidize low-risk ones. The 2023 reform partially corrected this cross-subsidization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We collect new data to document the long-run evolution of the firm size distribution in ten market-based economies in Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania, where we can obtain comprehensive coverage of the population of firms. Around the world, we observe prevalent increases in the concentration of sales, net income, and equity capital over the past century. These trends hold in the aggregate and at the industry level. Meanwhile, employment concentration has been stable over the long run in most cases. The evidence shows that the rising dominance of large firms is a pervasive phenomenon, not limited to the recent decades or the United States, and that large firms often achieve greater scale without proportionally more workers.</content>

    <title>Never Enough: Dynamic Status Incentives in Organizations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the ability of a firm to elicit repeated effort from workers by creating a “rat race” of hierarchical status-based incentives. We examine performance using data on over 5,000 German air force pilots during World War II. Pilots’ effort is hard to monitor; motivation is key to success. Fighter pilot performance increases markedly as they approach eligibility for a medal before falling off upon receipt of the award. The same effort path repeats itself as the pilot nears the next higher-prestige medal. Status-conscious pilots also exert more effort when new medals are introduced. We show that medals serve as substitutes for other forms of status. Medal cachet declines over time as lower-ability pilots receive them, making the introduction of new medals desirable. These results suggest that a tiered, expanding system of status-based incentives can repeatedly leverage worker status concerns to extract effort.</content>

    <title>Marginal Admission to Elite High Schools: Long-run Effects on Labor Market Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-run effects of marginal admission to elite public high schools on students' labor supply in the context of Mexico City's centralized high school admission system. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we compare students whose placement exam scores are just above and just below the elite admission threshold. We find that five and ten years after the admission exam, marginally admitted students are less likely to be employed in the formal private sector, and, if employed, they earn lower wages. However, these employment and wage gaps close after 15 years. Moreover, we find that marginal admission to elite high schools leads to delayed entry into the formal labor market, and, at least in the short run, students in elite high schools seem to sort into lower-productivity firms and industries.</content>

    <title>How Adaptable Are American Workers to AI-Induced Job Displacement?</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sam J. Manning &amp; Tomás Aguirre</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct an occupation-level adaptive capacity index that measures a set of worker characteristics relevant for navigating job transitions if displaced, covering 356 occupations that represent 95.9% of the U.S. workforce. We find that AI exposure and adaptive capacity are positively correlated: many occupations highly exposed to AI contain workers with relatively strong means to manage a job transition. Of the 37.1 million workers in the top quartile of AI exposure, 26.5 million are in occupations that also have above-median adaptive capacity, leaving them comparatively well-equipped to handle job transitions if displacement occurs. At the same time, 6.1 million workers (4.2% of the workforce in our sample) work in occupations that are both highly exposed and where workers have low expected adaptive capacity. These workers are concentrated in clerical and administrative roles. Importantly, AI exposure reflects potential changes to work tasks, not inevitable displacement; only some of the changes brought on by AI will result in job loss. By distinguishing between highly exposed workers with relatively strong means to adjust and those with limited adaptive capacity, our analysis shows that exposure measures alone can obscure both areas of resilience to technological change and concentrated pockets of elevated vulnerability if displacement were to occur.</content>

    <title>Tenure-Dependent Severance Costs and Labor Market Dynamics over the Life Cycle</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the labor market effects of tenure-dependent severance pay systems that tie firing costs to workers’ accumulated earnings histories. We develop an overlapping-generations search-and-matching model in which firms face increasing separation costs over the employment relationship. Using administrative employer–employee data from Brazil, we estimate the model and show that tenure-dependent severance costs induce labor hoarding among low-productivity, long-tenured workers who would not be hired if unemployed. These distortions are strongest late in the life cycle, when firms optimally delay separation to avoid severance obligations, while simultaneously imposing higher hiring thresholds on older unemployed workers with shorter continuation values. These forces imply that tenure-based severance policies protect employment histories rather than productivity, shaping labor market dynamics over the life cycle and generating allocative inefficiencies.</content>

    <title>Aggregate Productivity with Discrete Choice</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies aggregate productivity in general equilibrium economies where agents with heterogeneous preferences make discrete choices between locations and occupations. We show how the conventional tools of welfare economics, like cost-benefit analysis, can be extended to these settings. Following Debreu (1951), we measure the change in aggregate productivity as the maximum reduction in total factor productivity such that it is possible to make every household at least indifferent to their status quo allocation. Aggregate productivity rises if primary factors can be saved while keeping every household at least indifferent. We characterize this measure of efficiency in terms of compensated supply and demand curves. We show that, to a first-order approximation, the elasticity of aggregate productivity to productivity shocks is given by sales shares (regardless of preferences and technologies). We also provide second-order approximations in terms of elasticities of uncompensated supply and demand curves. We contrast our approach with some popular alternative measures of aggregate efficiency and welfare: real GDP, the cross-sectional average of utilities, and the sum of compensating variations, and show that these alternative measures have serious flaws.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prediction markets offer a new market-based approach to measuring macroeconomic expectations in real-time. We evaluate the accuracy of prediction market-implied forecasts from Kalshi, the largest federally regulated prediction market overseen by the CFTC. We compare Kalshi with more traditional survey and market-implied forecasts, examine how expectations respond to macroeconomic and financial news, and how policy signals are interpreted by market participants. Our results suggest that Kalshi markets provide a high-frequency, continuously updated, distributionally rich benchmark that is valuable to both researchers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>Research to Improve the Quality, Impact, and Value of Home and Community-Based Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly eight million Americans use Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) to support long-term services and supports for people with disabilities. Recent legislative changes to Medicaid will require states to make difficult choices about how best to meet these long-term services and supports needs. This paper first characterizes the unique goals of HCBS, which differ from those of traditional medical care services, and the state-federal financing and administrative structure of HCBS. Next, based on a review of the literature and input from a panel of experts in HCBS policy and research, we summarize existing evidence and knowledge gaps regarding the quality and cost implications of HCBS at the federal, state, and direct service provision levels. Based on gaps in the evidence, we propose a research agenda related to state-federal incentives, state program choices regarding HCBS financing and delivery models, and the settings and supports for direct service provision. Finally, we describe existing and novel data sources and other opportunities that could accelerate research to fill these evidence gaps and support states and others in designing, implementing, and delivering sustainable, high-quality HCBS.</content>

    <title>SNAP Work Requirements, Administrative Burden and Procedural Denials</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work requirements are often criticized for imposing administrative burdens that reduce access to benefits, yet prior research has struggled to isolate this mechanism from other sources of disenrollment. This paper provides direct evidence by examining procedural denials in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We study work requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) and exploit age-based exemptions that apply to individuals aged 50 and older. Using administrative data and difference-in-differences models leveraging waiver periods, we find that work requirements significantly increase procedural and overall denials. Our results indicate that these policies deter participation through imposed administrative burdens.</content>

    <title>The Distributional Effects of Cost-Sharing in a Universal Healthcare System</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Patient cost-sharing is used as a tool to limit over-utilization of insured healthcare services in almost all high-income countries. We study its distributional consequences in the context of a publicly-funded universal health insurance system, where consumers (as tax-payers) are residual claimants on insurer spending. We highlight the distinction between consumers' elasticity of demand for healthcare services—which moderates how cost-sharing rules affect healthcare utilization—and their baseline level of demand—which moderates how cost-sharing rules affect out-of-pocket costs. Using detailed administrative data on the Norwegian national health insurance scheme, we study a 2010 policy change that raised the age threshold for cost-sharing exemption, thereby increasing patient cost-sharing substantially for adolescents. We find that females and native-born Norwegians have higher average utilization and thus have more at stake financially from cost-sharing, but are relatively less responsive to cost-sharing. In contrast, lower-income individuals as well as individuals with a chronic health condition have both higher average healthcare utilization as well as higher responsiveness. Cost-sharing therefore places a larger burden on these groups both in terms of the financial cost of out-of-pocket spending and in terms of reduced quantities of healthcare used.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how political parties affect representation in the U.S. House. To do so, I account for party pressure on the votes of members in an otherwise standard spatial model that uses roll call voting patterns to identify member ideologies. I simultaneously estimate voter ideologies from survey responses, leveraging their responses on issues before Congress to bridge voters and members into the same ideological space. I find that, relative to a model without party pressure, member ideologies and those of their constituents are much more closely aligned. The results imply that, in terms of actual votes, parties drive a wedge between members and those they represent. I provide evidence that parties do so strategically, balancing the need for legislative wins and the electoral concerns of their members.</content>

    <title>Why is the Mental Health of the Youngest American Workers in Decline?</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The worsening mental health of young workers in the United States drives the disappearance of the U-shape in wellbeing and the hump-shape in illbeing in the last decade.  Illbeing declines in age among workers but is hump-shaped among non-workers across all US states. This has been the case for some time and is apparent in our analyses of two large US datasets with long time runs - the Behavioral Risk Survey System 1993-2025 and the National Health Interview Survey of 1997-2024. Although the mental health of workers and non-workers has been declining it has been deteriorating most quickly among young workers, leading to a steepening in the age gradient of mental illbeing for workers. Improvements in worker wellbeing (and declines in worker illbeing) with age are mirrored in age differences in reported working conditions in the American Job Quality Survey of 2025: six measures of job quality rise with age.  Declines in mental health are most pronounced among the youngest workers ages 18-22 who are likely drawn from lower socio-economic classes and report the greatest difficulties making ends meet.</content>

    <title>Hitting Rock Bottom: Economic Hardship and Cheating</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates whether economic hardship undermines preferences for honesty. We use controlled, high-stake measures of cheating for private benefit in a large sample of 5,664 Kenyans, exploiting three complementary sources of variation: experimentally manipulated monetary incentives to cheat, a randomized increase in the salience of one’s own financial situation, and the Covid‐19 income shock (exploiting randomized survey timing, with respondents interviewed before vs. during the crisis). We find that cheating behavior is highly responsive to financial incentives in the experiment. Covid-19 economic hardship—marked by a 51% drop in monthly earnings—leads to a sharp increase in the prevalence of cheating, and the effect increases gradually with prolonged hardship. The effects are largest among the most economically impacted and are amplified when the salience of one’s own financial situation is experimentally increased. The results demonstrate that while most individuals exhibit a strong preference against cheating under normal conditions (in line with the existing body of work), economic forces can account for a substantial share of variation in dishonesty: the estimated cheating rate rises from 29% under low stakes in normal times to 86% under high stakes during the crisis.</content>

    <title>The Geography of Science</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Abhishek Nagaraj &amp; Randol Yao</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Science has long been concentrated in the Western world, but the global research landscape is undergoing a profound reorganization. Using data on 44 million publications from 1980 to 2022, we document the geography of science in terms of who produces it, what it studies, and where it diffuses. The share of publications produced in the United States has fallen from 40% in 1980 to 15% in 2022, while China’s share has risen from near-zero to 32%. This pattern extends even to elite outlets, with China now producing over 35% of top-journal publications. Notably, this is driven not only by an expanding researcher base but also—to a large extent—by increases in individual productivity. This growth varies by fields: China leads in the Engineering and Physical Sciences (such as Chemistry), while the US retains its lead in Biomedical and Health Sciences. Moreover, China’s expanding leadership in scientific production has not translated into a commensurate shift in global diffusion and integration. Elite research remains disproportionately focused on US topics (40% of breakthrough publications), and citations to Chinese research disproportionately come from within China rather than from other regions, even for top-tier science. Similar to China, other middle- and low-income countries (including India, Russia, and Brazil) have also expanded output producing as much research as high-income European Union countries combined (about 21% overall) but they remain underrepresented in top-tier journals. Overall, our findings highlight both the democratization and fragmentation of global science, raising important questions about the future of the global scientific enterprise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We define the concept of customer overlap of product j with product k as the share of j's customers who buy k. We then argue that, in appropriate contexts, customer overlaps are an excellent proxy for diversion ratios, a useful and popular way to summarize competition between sellers of substitute products. Unlike diversion ratios, which are often challenging to estimate, customer overlaps are straightforwardly observed in many data sets. We show theoretically, and then validate empirically, the close connection between customer overlaps and diversion ratios. We then illustrate the potential use of customer overlap in contexts where estimation of diversion ratios could be prohibitive.</content>

    <title>Skipping the Factory: Service-Led Growth and Structural Transformation in the Developing World</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In today’s developing world, many economies appear to bypass industrialization and transition directly from agriculture to services. The largest rise in service employment has occurred in non-tradable consumer services, such as retail and hospitality, especially in urban areas, where many cities resemble consumer hubs built around local demand. These patterns of growth raise fundamental questions: Can service-led growth sustain a growth of living standards over time? Is service-led growth inherently biased toward affluent urban consumers? What role should policy play? We propose a parsimonious general equilibrium framework that incorporates non-homothetic preferences and locally non-tradable consumer services. Our framework bridges macro and micro perspectives, and enables counterfactual and welfare analysis that accounts for both individual and spatial heterogeneity. We relate our framework to the recent literature and suggest several extensions and directions of future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents new survey evidence on how household spending changes in response to fiscal transfers. Our key finding is that the planned propensity to spend out of transfers equals the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). This result implies that households do not incorporate future tax liabilities into their spending plans. The canonical HANK model cannot account for our survey results because people in that model are overly sensitive to future tax liabilities. We develop an extended HANK model in which households are partially inattentive to future tax liabilities and to the general-equilibrium consequences of fiscal policy. This inattention dampens forward-looking intertemporal MPCs, bringing the model into line with our survey evidence. We use the model to analyze the aggregate effects of fiscal policy changes and find that both transfer and government spending multipliers are larger in the inattentive HANK model than in the canonical HANK framework.</content>

    <title>AI-Enhanced Handheld ECGs to Screen for Prior Myocardial Infarction in Rural India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efforts to move care out of hospitals and into the community face a hard constraint: while most medications can be delivered anywhere, diagnosis is still mostly trapped inside the formal health system—clinics, hospitals, and the people and machines inside them. This is especially binding in low- and middle-income countries due to distance, cost, and limited health system capacity. Low-cost data collection devices (e.g., handheld electrocardiograms (ECGs), retinal cameras) are promising, but do not solve the bottleneck: their outputs still require expert interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) could turn these raw signals into actionable outputs at scale, but most medical AI is trained in high-income settings and deteriorates in different populations and settings. We assemble a new dataset in rural Tamil Nadu, India that links low-cost device signals to hospital-grade reference testing. We use it to build a proof-of-concept screening tool: an algorithm that predicts the result of a hospital-based reference-standard test (regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography), using only data from a handheld ECG device (cost: $60). This would allow targeting of secondary prevention medications—high-dose statins, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers—proven to be cost-effective in both high- and low-resource settings. We evaluate predictive performance and cost-effectiveness of such screening, benchmarking against common clinical risk scores (including the American Heart Association 10-year risk score). In a held-out test set, our model identifies subgroups with rates high enough to make screening very cost-effective: the top 2.5% have a 9.3% rate of evidence consistent with prior heart attack—about six times the base rate—delivering benefits at US$1,999 per life-year saved. The model also flags high-yield patients who would be missed by standard clinical scores, underscoring the limits of transporting Western-derived risk tools to low- and middle-income settings. To enable extensions to other conditions in the dataset, we make all data freely available for research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the increased cross-country ownership of financial assets between advanced and emerging economies impacted their financial and macroeconomic volatility. While cross-country ownership improved risk-sharing and reduced volatility associated with financial crises, it also increased the exposure of countries to foreign crises, leading to higher international co-movement. Through quantitative applications of a two-region model representative of advanced and emerging economies, we find that financial globalization reduced volatility worldwide, but significantly more in emerging economies.</content>

    <title>Capital Flows in a World Starved for Liquidity: Analysis and Policy Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a framework for studying financial and macroeconomic dynamics in an environment where liquid assets have a productive use but their supply is limited (i.e., the economy is starved for liquidity). The private demand for financial assets arises from the need to hold them for production. The private supply of financial assets is limited and unstable because of borrowing constraints and default risk. We discuss open-economy applications that analyze the accumulation of foreign reserves by emerging economies, the increase in public debt issued by advanced economies, the rapid growth of emerging economies, structural changes in financial markets, and financial globalization. A key result is that most of these developments led to a decline in interest rates and an increase in global macroeconomic volatility, driven by riskier borrower portfolios.</content>

    <title>How Restrictive is U.S. Trade Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This short note computes Trade Restrictiveness Index measures for current U.S. trade policy. Building on the ideas of Anderson and Neary (1996, 2005), the Trade Restrictiveness Index is the uniform tariff that leaves the U.S. consumer as well off as under actual policy. As of October 2025, U.S. trade policy is twice as restrictive as headline tariff numbers suggest. The Trade Restrictiveness Index is 23 percent, which stands in contrast to the 11 percent average tariff rate. Trade policy towards Canada and Mexico is two to three times more restrictive than average tariff rates suggest. Sectoral analysis shows that the restrictiveness is concentrated in vehicles, machinery, and electrical equipment.</content>

    <title>Unlocking Occupational Opportunity: The Labor Market Effects of DACA</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U.S. laws make it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented migrants. This legal constraint affects which firms will employ unauthorized workers and what jobs undocumented migrants can expect to get. As a result, unauthorized migrants are more likely to end up in jobs that have a lower risk of detection of immigration status and are less desirable. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which began in August 2012, gave temporary legal authorization to work in the U.S. to a subset of undocumented migrants – those who arrived in the U.S. as children meeting certain other eligibility criteria. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the effect of DACA on the occupational outcomes of young adults who arrived in the U.S. as children. Applying this strategy to individual-level data from the American Community Survey, we find that DACA eligibility decreases the likelihood that noncitizen childhood immigrants hold traditional immigrant jobs or jobs with a high risk of injury, and increases the likelihood of holding a government job or jobs that require occupational licensing. On the whole, DACA eligibility shifts noncitizen childhood immigrants to occupations that are higher-paying and employ more educated workers. These findings are consistent with legal barriers constraining undocumented childhood migrants from taking the jobs they are interested in and have the skills for. These workers are shunted to jobs they find less desirable and there are societal losses from the misallocation of talent.</content>

    <title>Community College Bachelor’s Degrees: How CCB Graduates’ Earnings Compare to AAs and BAs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first descriptive analysis of the economic value of Community College Baccalaureate (CCB) degrees by examining graduates’ early-career earnings, the costs of completing these programs, and the alignment between field of study and subsequent employment. Using administrative data and controlling for institution and field, we find that CCB graduates earn $4,000 to $9,000 more annually than Associate’s (AA) degree holders one year after graduation but experience average earnings penalties of roughly $2,000 relative to traditional Bachelor’s (BA) recipients. These averages mask substantial heterogeneity: penalties are largest in Computer and Information Technology and Engineering Technology, whereas CCB graduates in Nursing, other Healthcare fields, Business, and Criminal Justice exhibit minimal or no penalties. To contextualize these returns, we analyze tuition and fee structures across CCB-granting institutions and identify two dominant pricing models—constant and escalating. Total CCB program costs fall between those of AA and BA degrees, with escalating structures increasing upper-division prices by about 40 percent. Finally, we examine field-to-industry match patterns and find that CCB graduates in fields with well-defined occupational pathways, such as Health Professions and Education, are highly concentrated in aligned industries, while graduates in more diffuse fields, such as Computer Science, are more broadly dispersed.</content>

    <title>Subcontracting in Federal Spending: Micro and Macro Implications</title>
    <updated>2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the critical but underexplored role of subcontracting in shaping the spatial and firm-level effects of federal government spending. Using newly available data on defense subcontract awards linked to establishment-level data from NETS, we examine prime–subcontractor relationships across regions, industries, and over time. We document three key facts. First, subcontracting reallocates a substantial share of federal dollars across geographic areas, weakening the link between the location of prime contracts and where spending ultimately occurs. Second, subcontracting shifts spending across industries, notably from service-sector primes to manufacturing subcontractors. Third, large firms dominate subcontracting networks, including by receiving subcontracts from smaller primes. Accounting for geographic reallocation implies that conventional estimates understate local fiscal multipliers by about 20%. Furthermore, local multipliers are smaller for subcontracting than for prime contracting, partly because subcontracted spending is concentrated among large manufacturing firms that exhibit more muted employment responses. Establishment-level evidence further shows that subcontracting generates weaker employment effects, even conditional on firm size and industry, reflecting the less stable nature of subcontracting relationships. Overall, our findings show that subcontracting fundamentally reshapes the transmission of procurement spending through the private sector, with important implications for the local and aggregate effects of federal spending.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on 100 million transactions, we show how speculators, hedgers, and market makers interact in the world’s largest FX derivatives market, and that derivatives trading can affect exchange rates. Firms in the largest client sectors—pension and investment funds, insurers, and nonfinancials—use FX derivatives primarily to hedge currency risk, with dealer banks providing the liquidity. Hedge funds, with comparatively smaller net exposures, trade speculatively, whereas dealer banks insulate themselves from changes in speculative demand by taking offsetting positions with hedgers, especially nonfinancials. Non-bank market makers, instead, take residual exchange-rate exposures “on the margin”. Hedge funds’ speculative flows help transmit monetary policy shocks to exchange rates, while investment funds' unwinding of hedges contribute to dollar appreciations when credit risk rises. Our results highlight that exchange rates depend on the composition of trading activities in FX derivatives markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper discusses a fundamental problem in measuring the growth of knowledge and comparing the skills of people. New skills emerge that are not just more of the previously acquired skills. Psychometric convention forces these skills into arbitrarily constructed scales, which can severely distort measurement. To formally address this problem, we measure skills using a novel measurement scheme, estimate a stochastic learning process and reject the common scale assumption across levels for language and cognitive skills. Furthermore, we estimate dynamic complementarity without imposing arbitrary scales for skills.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic development relies on and transforms the environment. The transformation is evident in the poor environmental quality in many developing countries. For example, air quality in Southeast Asia is three times worse than in the United States, in sub-Saharan Africa four times worse and in South Asia more than six times worse. We model how environmental quality affects health, productivity and well-being and how individuals privately adapt to environmental hazards. We also model how collective action and formal regulation contribute to environmental quality. We draw three main findings from a review of empirical research on these mechanisms. First, individual adaptation to environmental hazards is both inadequate as a remedy and inefficiently low. Second, collective action, without the state, to manage resources or address externalities has been outstripped by the scale of environmental problems. Third, state action through formal regulation works better than it looks. Many formal regulations are coarse, poorly targeted and inefficient, but nonetheless yield benefits in excess of their costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how college major choices shape earnings and fertility outcomes. Using administrative data that link students' preferences, random assignment to majors, and post-college outcomes, we estimate the causal pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to different fields of study. We document substantial heterogeneity in these returns across majors and show that such variation helps explain gender gaps in labor market outcomes: women place greater weight on balancing career and family in their major choices, and these preference differences account for about 30% of the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Last, we use our causal estimates to evaluate the effects of counterfactual assignment rules that target representation gaps in settings with centralized assignment systems. We find that gender quotas in high-return fields can significantly reduce representation and earnings gaps with minimal impacts on efficiency and aggregate fertility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first global, long-run evidence on how war reshapes democratic institutions. Using data on all conflicts since 1948, we show that the onset of conflict causes a large and persistent decline in democracy: institutions weaken immediately, continue to erode for nearly a decade, and do not recover. Yet this deterioration is highly selective. It appears only in first-time conflicts, intrastate wars, highly fractionalized societies, and conflicts that governments win. The decline operates through political channels – media censorship, judicial purges, curtailed civil liberties, irregular leadership turnover, and constitutional suspensions - rather than through any functional requirement of war-making. Autocratization does not increase the probability of victory, and institutional instability reduces it. Taken together, the findings show that war does not require autocracy; it enables executives to expand their authority and implement institutional changes that would be difficult to enact in peacetime.</content>

    <title>Does Generative AI Crowd Out Human Creators? Evidence from Pixiv</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive dataset of posts from a major platform for anime- and manga-style artwork, we study the impact of the launch of a prominent text-to-image generative AI. Focusing on the majority of incumbent creators who do not adopt AI as a primary tool, we show that the AI launch led to a significant decline in post uploads by illustrators, whereas comic artists were less affected, reflecting the need for tight stylistic alignment across sequential images in comics. We present empirical evidence for two underlying mechanisms. First, illustration posts experience a loss of viewer attention, measured by bookmarks, following the AI launch, which can significantly harm creators’ business models. Second, direct competition from AI-generated content plays an important role: illustrators working on intellectual properties (IPs, such as Pokémon) that are more heavily invaded by AI reduce their uploads disproportionately more. We further examine creators’ responses and show that illustrators with greater exposure to AI avoid using tags favored by AI-generated content after the AI launch and broaden the range of IPs they work on, consistent with a risk-hedging response to AI invasion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How borrowers respond to future changes in the interest rate on their debt matters for the transmission of monetary policy and for household financial stability. Combining bank data, a letter RCT, and a survey, we study this question in the context of the German mortgage market, where since 2022 borrowers have faced high interest rates when their rate fixation period ends. We find that borrower actions substantially reduce the impact of higher rates on monthly payments. Survey responses corroborate high informedness and a strong propensity to prepare for rate changes. The letter intervention does not affect rate beliefs but increases awareness of available options and refinancing among borrowers close to expiration of their rate fixation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does industrial activity drive deforestation and land degradation, and can limited state capacity be overcome to decouple economic growth from environmental harm? We examine these questions in the context of slaughterhouse plant openings in Brazil from 1994 to 2019. Guided by a simple conceptual framework and using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that plant openings increase livestock production while reducing forest cover and degrading pastureland. However, following the introduction of legally enforceable, incentive-compatible agreements between slaughterhouses and federal prosecutors—which penalize purchases of livestock from illegally deforested areas but act as a green certification mechanism—plant openings increase productivity without driving deforestation. Our findings suggest that tying firm performance to environmental goals through market-aligned legal mechanisms can generate economic and environmental gains at low cost to the government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional valuation metrics for the U.S. stock market based on a comparison of the aggregate market value of U.S. corporations to measures of dividends, earnings, output, and the replacement cost of measured capital have been above historical norms for the past 25–30 years. Will they return to their historical means? We use macroeconomic data to argue that the observed decline in labor’s share of corporate output in conjunction with relatively weak corporate investment mechanically generates a persistent rise in the ratio of corporate valuation relative to corporate earnings, even absent any changes in expected returns or growth rates.</content>

    <title>A Few Bad Apples? Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate two interventions facilitating technology-sector transitions for women in Poland: Mentoring, focused on expanding professional networks, and Challenges, focused on building credible skill signals. Randomizing oversubscribed admissions, we find both programs substantially increase technology employment at twelve months-by 15 percentage points for Mentoring and 11 p.p. for Challenges. The distinct mechanisms through which the programs operate translate to heterogeneous treatment effects across geography, career stage, and baseline credentials. These differential effects create scope for improved allocation: algorithmic targeting across programs outperforms random assignment by 86% and outperforms experts' selection into Mentoring by 11%.</content>

    <title>Scaling Sustainable Investing in Emerging and Developing Economies: Frictions and Opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mobilizing private capital at scale is critical for financing sustainable development, particularly in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs), where capital is most needed. We conduct a global survey of senior investment decision-makers across a broad spectrum of capital providers, including asset managers, pension and sovereign wealth funds, development finance institutions, philanthropic investors, and others. The survey provides novel evidence on investors’ risk-return expectations, risk perceptions, and investment practices in EMDEs and in blended finance structures. We document four main findings. First, conditional on investor type, return expectations in EMDEs are comparable to those in developed markets, suggesting that categorical exclusions of EMDE assets might be inefficient. Second, investors’ dominant risk perceptions—particularly currency and political risks—are poorly aligned with the de-risking tools commonly employed in blended finance. Third, prevailing approaches to evaluating blended finance rely on both input- and outcome-based metrics, yet with limited measurement of financial and impact additionality. Fourth, our results highlight organizational and informational frictions, rather than unattractive financial fundamentals, as key barriers to scaling sustainable investing in EMDEs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), exhibit systematic behavioral biases in economic and financial decisions? If so, how can these biases be mitigated? Drawing on the cognitive psychology and experimental economics literatures, we conduct the most comprehensive set of experiments to date—originally designed to document human biases—on prominent LLM families across model versions and  scales. We document systematic patterns in LLM behavior. In preference-based tasks, responses become more human-like as models become more advanced or larger, while in belief-based tasks, advanced large-scale models frequently generate rational responses. Prompting LLMs to make rational decisions reduces biases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document and characterize a new history of U.S. federal-level industrial policies by scanning all 12,167 Congressional Acts and 6,030 Presidential Orders from 1973 through 2022. We find several interesting patterns. First, contrary to a common perception, the United States has always been an active industrial policy nation throughout the period, regardless of which party is in power, with 5.4 laws and 3.4 Presidential Orders per year on average containing new industrial policies. Second, we identify roughly 300% more instances of industrial policies than those in the Global Trade Alert (GTA) database during 2008-2022, despite using essentially the same definition. Third, industrial policies in practice are as likely to be justified by national security as by economic competitiveness. Fourth, many U.S. industrial policies incorporate design features that help mitigate potential drawbacks, such as explicit expiration dates and pilot programs for emerging technologies. Finally, based on stock market reactions and firm performance, the identified policies are recognized as economically significant in shifting resource allocations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage Becker’s time allocation theory to examine consumer demand and market competition for time-intensive goods. The Beckerian model predicts higher diversion ratios for goods with substantial time shares and those with high time costs relative to monetary prices. Applying this model to data from two field experiments, we analyze demand for Facebook and Instagram, focusing on substitution patterns across online activities and offline time use. Our findings indicate that users exhibit low elasticity to ad load, the primary user cost, and that time shares and time costs significantly influence diversion ratios. We explore the implications for user costs and benefits on these platforms and assess the potential impact of a Federal Trade Commission-proposed de-merger of Facebook and Instagram.</content>

    <title>The Demand for Grandchildren: Children as Family Public Goods and Implications for Cooperative Bargaining</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The title says it all. Well, almost all. To economists, the situation suggests bargaining between parents and grandparents, where the grandparents can "bribe" the parents to have more children or to have children sooner than they otherwise would. Because cash transfers seem inappropriate, bribes are likely to take the form of promises of child care or down payments on houses. Coasian bargaining or, more generally, cooperative bargaining models with their explicit assumption of Pareto efficiency offer accessible off-the shelf models. Larger family size (e.g., the participation of both pairs of grandparents) and family complexity (e.g., resulting from divorce and repartnering in the parents' generation or the grandparents' generation) threaten the assumption of zero or low transaction costs. Low transaction costs, explicit in the Coasian analysis and implicit in cooperative game theory's assumption of Pareto efficiency, play a crucial role. The generalization of family economics from the analysis of bargaining between spouses to include family members beyond the household will at some point require replacing Coasian and cooperative bargaining with models of noncooperative bargaining.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Retail Deposit Balances</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the dynamics of household deposits using account-level data from 12 million accounts across 154 U.S. credit unions. Significant skewness in the retail deposit distribution–with 10% of depositors controlling 70% of total deposits–means large-balance accounts drive aggregate retail deposit flows. On average, high-balance accounts become large after significant one-time inflows and are more likely to experience large, idiosyncratic drawdowns. Unlike low-balance households, high-balance retail depositors are not sensitive to interest rate shocks. Additional evidence suggests that overall retail deposit stickiness is driven by high-balance accounts that are used as medium-run liquidity stores rather than for interest income.</content>

    <title>The Informational Role of Emission Markets: Prices vs Quantities with Dispersed Information About Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study asymmetric information about the social cost of an externality, as opposed to asymmetric information about private costs of abatement. I show that quantity regulation with bankable permits has an informational advantage because the permit market aggregates dispersed information about social costs. It has the disadvantage of making private costs more uncertain ex ante. I analytically derive the expression for the (dis)advantage of prices over quantities in this setting. I show that a quantity policy can dominate a price policy for any slope of marginal private costs and always dominates when marginal private costs are sufficiently flat.</content>

    <title>The Twenty-four Hour Economy or Rolled-up Sidewalks: Trends in Work Timing and Their Causes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate nearly steady trends from 1973-2023 in the U.S. in the timing of when people work for pay, away from evening and night hours toward “usual” daytime hours. The trend is related to changes in rising educational attainment, to increased real incomes, and the increased wage premium for undesirable work times—evenings and nights—that we document. The trend exists in all major industries except retail, in which changes in technology biased work away from daytime hours. The trend was accelerated by the sharp increase in telework that occurred after the Covid pandemic, an increase that was especially concentrated during daytime hours. While we observe the same phenomenon in France from 1966 to 2010, we do not in the U.K. from 1974-2015, arguably because of the very sharp decline in unionization in the U.K. and the changes in retailing.</content>

    <title>Salience and the Elasticity of Taxable Income: Evidence from Top-bracket Tax Reforms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate heterogeneous responses to top-bracket tax reforms using a triple-difference design that exploits variation in tax rate changes and the thresholds at which they apply. This strategy identifies behavioral responses even in the presence of unobservable shocks to the income distribution. Higher-income taxpayers respond more to top-rate changes, but our results indicate that this reflects the salience of the reforms—the larger mechanical change in average tax rates at higher incomes—rather than heterogeneity in substitution elasticities. We discuss implications for the revenue and distributional effects of top-bracket tax reforms.</content>

    <title>No Taxation Without Administration: Bringing The State Back Into The Public Finance Of Developing Countries</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The empirical economics literature on taxation in developing countries has centered on the importance of third-party information for enforcement. Yet, while surely a long-run objective, leveraging such information remains out of reach in many developing countries due to largely informal economies and low state capacity. This article examines an emerging complementary literature focused on strengthening the 'sinews' of state capacity: tax administration. We argue that reforms to the organizational structure, personnel management, and task management of tax authorities have potential to raise tax capacity in developing countries. We also argue that efforts to improve the state's legitimacy – popular acceptance of its right to tax – can increase capacity and may complement investments in tax administration. Our approach bridges a long-standing divide between how scholars in public finance and political economy approach tax capacity building in developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how tariff uncertainty affects exchange rates, motivated by the U.S. dollar’s depreciation after the 2025 tariff announcements. Standard macro-trade models predict that unilateral tariffs appreciate the implementing country’s currency, but we show this result can be overturned by policy uncertainty. We build a two-country general equilibrium model with risk-averse agents and segmented financial markets, where tariff volatility enters uncovered interest parity through a risk-premium wedge. Higher tariff uncertainty increases precautionary savings and risk premia, leading to immediate currency depreciation even as tariffs rise. Quantitatively, the model replicates the size and timing of the observed dollar depreciation episode dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose rational disagreement as a formal framework for analyzing seemingly irrational behavior that can persist despite the wide availability of objective information in a steady-state. Agents are rational in that they correctly anticipate the distribution of aggregate outcomes, yet disagree about which specific individuals perform better than others. Notably, the subjective belief of any individual may be objectively correct.
We illustrate the key concepts with a simple entry game. We show how unordered individual outcome distributions can be identified solely from aggregate statistics. We then characterize the resulting game, define its Nash equilibria, and develop a statistical test for the null hypothesis of agreement. Finally, we situate our framework within the broader literature on Bayesian games, behavioral biases, and the rational expectations hypothesis.</content>

    <title>The Contribution of College Majors to Gender and Racial Earnings Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender and racial/ethnic gaps in labor market earnings remain large, even among college-goers. Cross-gender and race/ethnic differences in choice of and returns to college major are potentially important contributors. Following Texas public high school graduates for up to 20 years through college and the labor market, we assess gender and racial differences in college major choices and the consequences of these choices. Women and underrepresented minorities are less likely than men, Whites, and Asians to major in high earning fields like business, economics, engineering, and computer science, however we also show that they experience lower returns to these majors. Differences in major-specific returns relative to liberal arts explain about one quarter of the gender, White-Black, and White-Hispanic (but not White-Asian) earnings gaps among four-year college students and become larger contributors to earnings gaps than differential major distributions as workers age. We present suggestive evidence that differences in occupation choices within field are a key driver of the differences in returns across groups. The work shines light on the roles that college major choice and returns by gender and race contribute to inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter presents a tractable framework for the study of technology adoption and diffusion in the context of economic development. Firms in countries behind the world technology frontier can rapidly adopt new techniques from the world frontier. Lower absorptive capacity (because of weak education systems, poor management practices, or barriers to technology adoption), institutional distortions, mismatch between frontier technologies and the needs of firms in the country (i.e., “inappropriate technology”), and credit market frictions slow down technology adoption and cause the economy in question to have a greater distance to the frontier and thus lower income per capita—although the long-run growth rate of the country still remains equal to that of the frontier. This framework is extended to study the choice between innovation and imitation, as well as the role of selection for higher-productivity and higher-absorptive capacity firms during the process of economic development. We illustrate the main comparative statics of our framework with a number of correlations based on cross-country and firm-level data. The tractability of the framework makes it amenable to a range of additional extensions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that migration flows upon retirement are predominantly from richer, more urban to poorer, more rural regions. In theory, the local economic implications of senior in-migration are ambiguous, while empirically there is little existing evidence on whether attracting mobile seniors can be an effective tool to promote economic development among lagging regions. We combine a unique collection of microdata from France with a new empirical strategy to fill this gap. We find that senior inflows have significant positive effects on the local economy over the course of a decade, including increases in the working-age population, total employment, GDP, average incomes, fiscal revenues and housing construction. These effects are particularly pronounced among initially poorer regions. They are accompanied by an increase in the share of services in the local economy, driven by employment growth in health, food services and retail sectors. Combining these estimates with observed region-to-region net migration flows, we find that mobile seniors have become a significant force for reducing the concentration of employment and GDP across regions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adult Black men persistently do not report to household-based surveys, with demographers estimating non-reporting rates of 7-14% from 1970-2020. We derive a method to account for incomplete data and show that non-reporting rates are up to 5.5 percentage points (pp) larger than prior estimates, with significant heterogeneity by year. We then show that Black men at risk of incarceration drive non-reporting. We use state-year variation in incarceration rates to estimate that 35-83% of the incarcerated population would have been non-reporting if not incarcerated. Adjusting for previously uncorrected non-reporting shows that the Black-white gap in high-school completion is 20-39% (3.0-5.9 pp) larger, college attendance is 8-18% (3.1-6.1 pp) larger, and earnings is 10-20% (2.8-5.7 pp) larger. In contrast, the gap in  employment is 4-8% (0.6-1.6 pp) smaller than previously thought.</content>

    <title>Current Account Deficits and the Welfare of Future Generations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the effects of one nation's  taxation of consumption on the welfare of future generations of other countries. To do this, it presents an otherwise standard one-good, two-country optimal growth model with free capital markets, but where each date represents the lifetime of a generation which cares not only about its own consumption and leisure, but also that of its descendants.
Relative to a no tax benchmark, a policy of one country taxing consumption of its initial generations has ambiguous welfare effects for future generations of the other country, as long as those future generations are not too far in the future.   Higher initial savings in the first country raises capital levels, and thus wages, in both countries, raising welfare of future generations in the second country, but also induces lower bequests in the second country, lowering the welfare of its future generations.  In the long run, or for generations born near the steady state, the welfare effects of the first country inducing lower consumption of its initial generations are unambiguous: future generations of the second country are made worse off.  Households born in the second country will regret that their ancestors allowed such policy-induced intertemporal trade.</content>

    <title>Psychology and Development: Applications from Cognitive and Social Psychology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We outline a research agenda for behavioral development economics that seeks to understand the role of psychological channels in: (i) impeding individuals' ability to climb out of poverty, and (ii) shaping the organization of production, functioning of markets, and role of informal institutions in developing countries.  We apply a missing markets lens to rationalize why tools, products and services that help individuals overcome their biases will be under-supplied by the market and why behavioral biases can have large impacts in steady state, even among highly experienced agents. We argue that these biases are especially likely to matter for the field of development because core features of poverty---proximity to subsistence, high volatility,  market failures,  weak formal institutions, and reliance on social ties---amplify the impact of psychological constraints. We organize our review around a core set of psychological constructs: self-control, cognitive constraints, self-beliefs, mental health, and social norms. For each construct, we highlight places where there is only a proof of concept versus evidence of meaningful impacts, and the resultant implications for future research. We also highlight where social capital can be deployed to mitigate the impacts of missing markets. The field research to date has only begun to scratch the surface in document how psychological mechanisms affect behavior and decision-making, and substantial scope remains for future work to determine whether these constraints play a first-order role in shaping poverty.</content>

    <title>Understanding Latin America’s Fertility Decline: Age, Education, and Cohort Dynamics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the sharp decline in fertility across Latin America using both period and cohort measures. Combining Vital Statistics, Census microdata, and UN population data, we decompose changes in fertility by age, education, and joint age–education groups. We show that the decline in period fertility between 2000 and 2022 is driven primarily by reductions in within-group birth rates rather than by changes in population composition, with the largest contributions coming from younger and less-educated women. Comparing the cohort born in the mid 1950s and the one born in the mid 1970s, we find that the decline in completed fertility reflects not only delayed childbearing but also substantial reductions in the average number of children per woman. This is driven primarily by lower fertility among mothers rather than by rising childlessness. Our findings provide new evidence on the nature of Latin America’s transition to below-replacement fertility and highlight several open questions for future research.</content>

    <title>Speculative Growth and the AI "Bubble"</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;AI technology can generate speculative-growth equilibria. These are rational but fragile: elevated valuations support rapid capital accumulation, yet persist only as long as beliefs remain coordinated. Because AI capital is labor-like, it expands effective labor and dampens the normal decline in the marginal product of capital as the capital stock grows. The gains from this expansion accrue disproportionately to capitalists, whose saving rate rises with wealth, raising aggregate saving.  Building on Caballero et al (2006), I show that these features generate a funding feedback—rising capitalist wealth lowers the required return—that can produce multiple equilibria. With intermediate adjustment costs, elevated valuations are the mechanism that sustains a transition toward a high-capital equilibrium; a loss of confidence can precipitate a self-fulfilling crash and reversal.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The energy transition away from fossil fuels toward alternative energy sources will, like every significant economic transition, disrupt existing economic relationships and markets. Disruption in the labor market is of particular concern due to the distributional and political importance of energy jobs and the potential concentration of risks on workers in carbon-intensive sectors and regions that are particularly reliant on fossil-fuel industries. We look at modeling the labor implications of the energy transition. We outline a conceptual framework for analyzing the labor-market risks, focusing on obstacles to labor-market adjustments during the transition. We then review empirical research on such barriers to labor-market adjustments, with a focus on evidence that can inform modeling efforts. We also survey the literature on ex-ante modeling of the effects of the energy transition on labor markets, identifying both the challenges and opportunities for new research in this field.</content>

    <title>Financial Crises: History, Theory and New Insights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review essay discusses the history, causes and consequences of financial crises. In recent years scholars have assembled new sources of data and utilized new empirical designs to analyze crises, shedding light on old questions and producing new insights. This essay highlights those new insights, and uses the historical record of crises in the United States to put those insights into perspective. I begin with a discussion of the defining characteristics of financial crises and their evolution, both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. I then revisit the chronology of crises in the U.S. since 1870. Data on bank failure rates and large-bank equity losses suggest that some panics were not full-blown financial crises, and also identify episodes when no panic occurred that could potentially be considered crises. I then turn to two categories of theoretical models developed to analyze the mechanisms responsible for crises. The first focuses on asset price bubbles, which have been associated with many crises. The second is focused on the dynamics of bank runs and panics, which have been especially common in the United States. Finally, I present an overview of the effects of crises and the mechanisms transmitting financial distress in the banking system into the rest of the economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Benchmark models of structural transformation focus on the reallocation of employment across sectors while assuming that overall employment stays constant. We show that this assumption does not match facts for developing economies. We study a panel of 48 mostly developing economies over the period 1990--2018 and document a strong positive relationship between the share of the population employed in agriculture and the overall employment rate. That is, the early part of the development process is associated with a substantial decline in the total employment rate. Motivated by this finding, we extend a benchmark model of structural change featuring Stone-Geary preferences to allow for endogenous labor supply. We show that this model can account for the patterns we document in the data both qualitatively and quantitatively. We use a calibrated version of our model to study the employment dynamics in several developing economies and show that structural change is a quantitatively important source of employment changes during the early stages of development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite substantial convergence in men’s and women’s economic roles, gender gaps in labor market outcomes persist across countries. This article provides a unified framework for understanding how gender norms shape economic behavior, distinguishing between internalized norms—preferences and beliefs tied to gender identity—and external norms arising from peer pressure and social coordination. We first document cross-country and within-country variation in gender attitudes, alongside gradual but uneven shifts toward more egalitarian views. We then review empirical evidence on the origins, persistence, and transmission of gender norms, and their effects on human capital accumulation, labor supply, wages, and policy take-up. The review highlights both the durability of gender norms and the mechanisms through which policies, institutions, and media can induce norm change, with implications for the design of effective interventions.</content>

    <title>You Only Live Twice: Financial Inflows and Growth in a Westward-Facing Ukraine</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The monumental task of rebuilding postwar Ukraine requires early planning and identification of growth strategies. The earlier accession of Eastern European countries to the European Union and NATO offers a template that relies on massive foreign direct investment and public structural funds. This approach helps to raise incomes directly and can create a virtuous circle where capital deepening facilitates technological upgrades and repatriation of war refugees, which in turn stimulate more investment. We show theoretically that the government can refine this strategy by internalizing positive externalities from having a higher capital stock: Investment in physical capital relaxes borrowing constraints (thus allowing more capital inflows) and raises wages (thus encouraging more Ukrainian refugees to return home).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When do people identify with their class? Evidence from social psychology shows that individuals are more likely to identify with a group if they are similar to its members. We study early 20th century Britain and show that regional cultural heterogeneity combined with internal migration influenced class identity. We develop and validate a measure of class identity using naming decisions. Exploiting within-household variation, we show that migration patterns that increased the local share of culturally-distant workers reduced working class identification. Where migration increased the cultural distance of the working class, workers were less likely to join unions, voters were less likely to support the nascent Labour Party, and parliamentary candidates were less likely to target working class voters. By 1911, slower in-migration and rising local population growth reduced working class distance in urban areas, which also became strongholds of support for Labour. Migration alters social identity and creates political cleavages.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Effects of Neighborhood Policies: a Dynamic Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the macroeconomic effects of neighborhood-specific policies in a general equilibrium model of a city with endogenous residential sorting and educational investment. A key feature of the model is the presence of endogenous local spillovers that depend on the distribution of families across neighborhoods. We analyze three policies: a housing-voucher policy inspired by the MTO program, which enables poor families to relocate to low-poverty neighborhoods; a place-based transfer (PBT) policy that provides monetary transfers to families in poor neighborhoods; and a place-based investment (PBI) policy that invests resources in local institutions, such as public schools, to directly enhance local spillovers. We find that the MTO policy generates substantial income gains for children of recipient families, but scaling up the program dampens these gains and induces large welfare losses for non-recipients. By contrast, the PBT policy delivers larger average welfare gains but is less effective in reducing inequality and segregation. Finally, the PBI policy produces smaller short-run effects but, over time, resolves the trade-off by raising average welfare while simultaneously reducing inequality, lowering segregation, and improving intergenerational mobility.</content>

    <title>Immigration Restrictions and Natives' Intergenerational Mobility: Evidence from the 1920s US Quota Acts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of immigration restrictions on the intergenerational mobility of US-born men in the United States. We link US-born sons observed in 1900, 1920, and 1940 full-count Censuses to their fathers, and construct a measure of county-level exposure to the 1920s immigration acts, which sharply curtailed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. Exploiting this policy-induced variation, we find that the quotas reduced intergenerational mobility among US-born white men, but had no adverse effect for Black men. Among whites, losses were smaller for sons of richer fathers, who were more likely to migrate away from highly exposed areas. Evidence from the 1940 Census indicates that exposed white men were less likely to be employed and earned lower wages in adulthood, consistent with both occupational downgrading and reduced productivity within occupations. We show that these effects operated through both reduced immigrant–native complementarities and incomplete substitution from unrestricted migration, while human capital investment can  explain at most only a modest part of the total effect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a  framework for estimating demand across multiple assets with bidding  data. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on price instruments, which are often difficult to obtain. We describe the data requirements for implementation and illustrate its versatility using two applications: message-level data from Nasdaq and bidder-level data from Canadian Treasury bill auctions.  We argue that understanding demand systems is a crucial factor in assessing the impact of market design on price stability and liquidity.</content>

    <title>How do Foundations Help Charities (Beyond Giving them Money)?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foundations are a rapidly growing source of charitable support, yet their effects on nonprofits remain poorly understood. We study applicants to a $100 million funding competition whose sponsoring foundation subsequently offered publicity, networking, and advice to a subset of unsuccessful entrants. This support substantially improved later fundraising for smaller charities. Our estimates indicate that the foundation’s support generated over $40 million in income in the years following the competition. These findings offer novel evidence of how large donors can influence nonprofit success even without awarding funds, and show how funding competitions might be structured to help charities raise additional resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mental illness exacts a heavy toll on the US healthcare system and strains general hospitals and their emergency departments. We study how psychiatric inpatient facility entry impacts the local hospital industry. We find that referrals, including from the legal system, are redirected to the specialized facilities––leaving general hospitals with approximately 60% fewer psychiatric admissions. General hospitals also discharge 50% more patients to psychiatric facilities and substitute away from high-skill psychiatric labor––consistent with specialization and market segmentation. Emergency department volumes do not change but care does. However, community-based crime, overdose deaths, and suicides do not decline in the short-run.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Selection and the Puzzle of Slow Climate Change Adaptation in U.S. Agriculture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-run studies of agricultural productivity use balanced county-level panel data to document slow adaptation to climate change in U.S. agriculture. We revisit this treatment-effect puzzle using a selection model that incorporates the optimizing behavior of heterogeneous farmers. Using data from 1980 to 2020, we document three dynamic selection effects. First, counties that completely exit farming alter the composition of the balanced panel sample. Second, higher-skilled workers are more likely to leave rural areas as weather conditions worsen. Third, smaller farms consolidate into larger farms in counties affected by climate change. We document that the yield damage function’s slope depends on the county’s educational level and farm size.  Causal estimates of weather impacts must account for selection effects along several adaptation margins of adjustment.</content>

    <title>The Life-cycle of Concentrated Industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are competition policies designed for static industries suitable for innovative industries where dynamic competition for the market is key? If not, how should policies differ? We develop a model of the life-cycle of an oligopolistic industry: a version of Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994) with a finite number of firms. The equilibrium features a period of intense entry, followed by a shakeout and eventual industry concentration as some firms scale through innovation while most exit. We analyze the second-best problem of a government subsidizing small firms to promote competition. Innovation and dynamic competition do not necessarily justify intervention, as the equilibrium can still be second best. In general, the optimal policy depends on the nature of competition. Firms primarily compete for the market when innovation leads to large differences in scale. The government can wait to intervene in this case; committing to do whatever it takes to promote competition if and when the industry concentrates excessively. Subsidies early in the life-cycle are unnecessary. These results contrast with calls for aggressive ex-ante regulation in highly innovative industries, suggesting a wait-and-see approach may be preferable. We apply these insights to digital and AI industries in the U.S. using data on venture-backed firms.</content>

    <title>Life-Cycle Effects of Women's Education on their Careers and Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the causal effect of women's education on their wages, non-wage job amenities, and spillovers to children. Using a regression discontinuity at the school entry birthdate cutoff, we find that women born just before the cutoff are more likely to complete some college, and experience multi-dimensional career gains that grow over the life cycle: greater employment and earnings, as well as more professional and higher-status jobs, more socially meaningful work, and better working conditions. Children’s early-life health and prenatal inputs improve in tandem with career improvements, consistent with professional advances spurring—not hindering—infant investments. Career gains are concentrated in jobs that require exactly some college, the same schooling margin shifted by the cutoff, which indicates that increased post-secondary education is the primary channel for these effects. Together, the results show that women's college attendance generates large career returns—from both wages and amenities—that strengthen over time and produce meaningful benefits for children.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a dynamic model of the U.S. space launch industry. The model allows past launches to improve rocket reliability and lower launch costs. It also allows the government to make forward-looking procurement choices. We use the model to analyze policy-relevant issues in the recent history of the industry: the 2006 United Launch Alliance “merger-to-monopoly” and the effects of efficiencies in the form of learning synergies; innovations, such as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and ULA's recent introduction of Vulcan Centaur; the costs and benefits of forward-looking procurements; and, the trade-offs between the advantages of centralized control and possible inefficiencies.</content>

    <title>The Future of Monetarism after Milton Friedman</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On the fiftieth anniversary of Milton Friedman receiving the Nobel Prize in economics, I reflect on the legacy of monetarism – his revolutionary idea. Friedman developed the modern quantity of money in 1956 as a challenge to the prevailing Keynesian view that “money did not matter.” Friedman’s empirical and historical research made a strong case that changes in the money supply, largely instituted by the monetary authorities, account for much of the macro instability in the twentieth century including the Great Recession 1929-1933 and the Great Inflation 1965 -1982. Friedman’s ideas were at the base of the creation of modern macroeconomics, and of the adoption by many central banks of rules based monetary policy as a guidepost to maintain credibility for low inflation. His emphasis on monetary aggregates as the key monetary policy tool has been superseded by the use of policy interest rates, but the monetary aggregates are still useful as a crosscheck against incipient high inflation.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Effects of Climate Policy Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel measure of climate policy uncertainty based on newspaper coverage. Our index spikes during key U.S. climate policy events—including presidential announcements on international agreements, congressional debates, and regulatory disputes—and shows a recent upward trend. Using an instrument for plausibly exogenous uncertainty shifts, we find that higher climate policy uncertainty decreases output and emissions while raising commodity and consumer prices, acting as supply rather than demand shocks. Faced with this trade-off, monetary policy does not accommodate climate policy uncertainty shocks, shaping their transmission. Firm-level analyses show stronger declines in investment and R&amp;D when firms have higher climate change exposure.</content>

    <title>What Happens When Dating Goes Online? Evidence from U.S. Marriage Markets and Health Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how online dating platforms have impacted marital outcomes, assortative matching, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates in the United States. We construct county-level measures of online dating usage using data from website-based platforms (2002–2013) and mobile app-based platforms (2017–2023). Leveraging county-level variation and an instrumental variable strategy, we show in the desktop era, a 1% increase in online dating sessions raises divorce rates by 0.50%, while in the mobile era, a 1% increase in online dating activity lowers marriage and divorce rates by 0.40% and 0.33%, respectively. We also document shifts in assortative matching. Desktop sites reduce sorting along education and employment dimensions, whereas mobile sites reduce sorting by employment, but increase sorting by race. Across both eras, we find no evidence that greater online dating usage increases average STD rates. Average effects are negative or statistically insignificant, but are positive for some subpopulations. We develop a search and matching model where technological changes that impact search costs, market size, and market noise can explain our empirical findings.</content>

    <title>Is the Environmental Exposure Gap Shrinking? Evidence from an Extreme Multi-exposure Index</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demographic disparities in exposure to various sources of environmental stress are well documented. While specific stressors are linked to adverse health outcomes, there is uncertainty about how they interact. A first step towards evaluating these joint impacts is to understand the degree to which the same individuals are exposed to extreme simultaneous exposure to each stressor. Here, we adapt the Alkire-Foster multi-dimensional poverty measure to rank exposures to multi-dimensional environmental harm in a way that accounts for the frequency, breadth, and severity of exposure among the extremely exposed. This measure can be used to normatively compare distributions of extreme simultaneous exposure for a given group both across time and in comparison with other groups. We use publicly-available data on air toxics, PM2.5, and land surface temperature to identify trends in the multi-exposure index for socio-demographic groups based on race/ethnicity and poverty status for 168 U.S. cities. Controlling for city-characteristics, we find persistent, yet narrowing, multi-exposure gaps on the basis of race/ethnicity between people of color (POC) and non-Hispanic White. Within each group, individuals in households above the poverty line fare better than those below, but above-poverty POC have similar multi-exposure to below-poverty non-Hispanic White.</content>

    <title>Creating High-Opportunity Neighborhoods: Evidence from the HOPE VI Program</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether low-economic-mobility neighborhoods can be transformed into high-mobility areas by analyzing the HOPE VI program, which invested $17 billion to revitalize 262 distressed public housing developments. We estimate the program’s impacts using a matched difference-in-differences design, comparing outcomes in revitalized developments to observably similar control developments using anonymized tax records. HOPE VI reduced neighborhood poverty rates by attracting higher-income families to revitalized neighborhoods, but had no causal impact on the earnings of adults living in public housing units. Children raised in revitalized public housing units earned more, were more likely to attend college, and were less likely to be incarcerated. Using a movers exposure design and sibling comparisons, we show that these improvements were driven by changes in neighborhoods’ causal effects on children’s outcomes. The improvements in neighborhood causal effects were driven in large part by changes in social interaction: HOPE VI increased interaction between public housing residents and peers in surrounding neighborhoods and increased earnings more for subgroups with higher-income peers. Many low-income families in the U.S. currently live in neighborhoods that are as socially isolated as the HOPE VI developments were prior to revitalization. We conclude that it is feasible to create high-opportunity neighborhoods and that connecting socially isolated areas to surrounding communities is a cost-effective approach to doing so.</content>

    <title>Well-being Increases in Age Among Workers: Evidence From 103 Countries</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how workers’ and non-workers’ wellbeing varies by age across 171 countries in eight international surveys. In 103 countries (60%) we find evidence that workers’ wellbeing rises with age and workers' illbeing falls with age. This relationship appears to have strengthened over time in some countries.  Patterns are different among non-workers and are sensitive to survey mode. Where surveys are conducted using Computer-Assisted Web-based Interviews (CAWI) non-workers’ wellbeing is U-shaped, but this is less clear-cut when the data are collected with Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI). The change in the age profile of workers’ wellbeing may reflect changes in selection into (out of) employment by age, changes in job quality, or changes in young workers’ orientation to similar jobs over time.  But changes in smartphone usage – often the focus of debate regarding declining young peoples’ wellbeing – are unlikely to be the main culprit unless there are sizeable differences in smartphone usage across young workers and non-workers, which appears unlikely.</content>

    <title>Changing Culture and Norms in Developing Countries</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey recent research on changing culture and social norms in developing countries and propose a simple framework to interpret these changes. We conceptualize individual utility from a given action as a function of three components: intrinsic valuations, material payoffs, and social interactions. Using this lens, we review evidence on interventions that target each component and their interactions.
First, we discuss efforts to shift intrinsic values through schooling and curricula, information campaigns, mass media, and empowerment programs, with particular attention to gender norms, intimate partner violence, and harmful practices such as female genital cutting. Second, we examine social determinants of behavior, including misperceptions about others’ beliefs, coordination failures, and the role of intermediate “stepping-stone” actions in facilitating or hindering norm transitions. Third, we analyze how changes in material incentives, via labor market opportunities, transfers, and legal reforms, affect behavior and underlying norms.
Throughout, we highlight methodological challenges in measuring norms and identifying mechanisms, and we emphasize that policy effects depend critically on existing social structures and belief distributions. We conclude by outlining open questions from a positive and normative perspective.</content>

    <title>Banking on Inattention</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that depositor inattention gives rise to banks’ deposit market power. Using transaction-level data on millions of U.S. depositors, we document that unscheduled income remains in low-rate accounts much longer than scheduled income, and interpret this reaction-time gap as inattention. Inattention varies widely across depositors, and more inattentive depositors adjust their balances less in response to monetary policy changes. We then develop and test a theory of temporal monopoly to analyze the implications of inattention for bank funding. Banks face an intertemporal trade-off in deposit rate setting between current spreads and the future deposit base, modulated by inattention. In line with this theory, we find that banks serving more inattentive depositors set lower rates, have weaker pass-through, and experience less deposit flow sensitivity. Using these estimates, we calibrate how the value of banks’ deposit franchise rises with inattention and varies nonmonotonically with the policy rate. Our results shed new light on how digital banking and monetary policy affect deposit funding.</content>

    <title>Managers and the Cultural Transmission of Gender Norms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how managers’ gender attitudes shape workplace culture and gender inequality. Using data from a multinational firm operating in over 100 countries, we leverage cross-country manager rotations to identify the effects of male managers' gender attitudes on gender pay gaps within a team. Managers from countries with one standard deviation more progressive gender attitudes reduce the pay gap by 5 percentage points (18%), largely through higher promotion rates for women. These effects persist after managers rotate out and are strongest in more conservative countries. Managers with progressive attitudes also influence the local office culture, as local managers who interact with but are not under the purview of the foreign manager begin to have smaller pay gaps in their teams. Our evidence points to individual managers as critical in shaping corporate culture.</content>

    <title>Enhancing Worker Productivity Without Automating Tasks: A Different Approach to AI and the Task-Based Model</title>
    <updated>2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The task-based approach has become the dominant framework for studying the labor-market effects of artificial intelligence (AI), typically emphasizing the replacement of human workers by machines. Motivated by growing empirical evidence that contemporary AI is more often used as a tool that augments workers, this paper develops two related task-based models in which AI enhances worker productivity without automating tasks. Abstracting from capital, we develop a pair of related task-based models that examine how technological progress in AI that provides new tools to augment workers affects aggregate productivity and wage inequality. Both models emphasize the role of human capital in intermediating the effects of AI-related technological shocks. In the first model, AI use requires specialized expertise, and technological progress expands the set of tasks for which such expertise is effective. We show that a larger supply of AI expertise amplifies the productivity gains from improvements in AI technology while attenuating its adverse effects on wage inequality. The second model focuses on non-AI skills, allowing AI tools to alter the set of tasks that workers can perform given their skills. In equilibrium, workers allocate across tasks in response to wages, generating an endogenous distribution of skills across the task space. A central result is that aggregate productivity and wage inequality depend on different global properties of this equilibrium distribution: productivity is particularly sensitive to thinly staffed tasks that create bottlenecks, while wage inequality is driven by the concentration of workers in a narrow set of tasks. As a result, improvements in AI tools can induce non-monotonic co-movement between productivity and inequality. By linking these mechanisms to multidimensional human capital---including AI expertise and higher-order non-AI skills---the paper highlights the role of education and training policies in shaping the economic consequences of AI-driven technological change.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Charter Schools on Identification, Service Provision, and Achievement of Students with Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Students with disabilities (SWDs) encompass a sizable share of charter students and have an array of individualized needs. Charter schools may operate differently than traditional public schools with respect to SWDs and special education (SPED), as funding incentives may induce charter schools to underserve SWDs. Nonetheless, there is little empirical evidence regarding how enrollment in charter schools affects SWDs’ educational environments and outcomes. We use data from Michigan to estimate charter impacts using a heterogeneous difference-in-differences model that compares students who enter charters to students who have not yet but will eventually enter charters. We find that charters are slightly more likely to identify students as SWDs after charter entry. While assignments to SPED programs increase comparably, there is a significant reduction and subsequent reversion in time spent in SPED-specific environments and services provided. Despite these changes, SWDs realize achievement and attendance gains after charter entry at similar levels to non-SWDs.</content>

    <title>AI and the Quantity and Quality of Creative Products: Have LLMs Boosted Creation of Valuable Books?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the diffusion of LLMs between 2022 and 2025, new book releases have tripled, raising a question of AI's impact on book quality. We develop a ratings-based usage measure that is comparable across book release vintages, and we find that the vintages from the AI influx period have lower average quality.  Yet, the top 1,000 monthly releases per category - albeit not the top 100 - have higher quality than before; and the effect is larger in categories with faster growth in new titles. Authors entering since the LLM influx produce predominantly low-quality work; and the higher-quality output of pre-LLM authors entrants has risen. A nested logit calibration shows that LLM-enhanced book production could, in steady state, raise the surplus that consumers derive from book markets by a quarter to a half.</content>

    <title>Trade and US Inequality in the Tokyo Round</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Against a backdrop of sharply rising inequality, the Tokyo Round of the GATT resulted in a 1.6 percentage point reduction in average US tariffs – larger than CUSFTA, NAFTA, and the liberalization accompanying the granting of PNTR to China. We construct a novel IV based on the so-called “Swiss formula” that governed the Tokyo Round tariff liberalization to provide evidence of its effects on imports and inequality. Instrumented tariff reductions explain approximately 20% of the rise in income inequality between non-production and production workers between 1979 and 1988. This effect is largest among women, workers in routine occupations, and workers in more technology-intensive industries, suggesting a complementarity between trade liberalization and skill-biased technological change.</content>

    <title>Optimal Use of Preferences in Artificial Intelligence Algorithms</title>

      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning systems embed preferences either in training losses or through post-processing of calibrated predictions. Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision-problem-agnostic conditions under which separation—training preference-free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected-utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind—as documented in human-AI decision-making—preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through postprocessing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (A.I.) will likely be the most important technology we have ever developed. Technologies such as electricity, semiconductors, and the internet have been transformative, reshaping economic activity and dramatically increasing living standards throughout the world. In some sense, artificial intelligence is simply the latest of these general purpose technologies and at a minimum should continue the economic transformation that has been ongoing for the past century. However, the case can certainly be made that this time is different. Automating intelligence itself arguably has broader effects than electricity or semiconductors. What if machines—A.I. for cognitive tasks and A.I. plus advanced robots for physical tasks—can perform every task a human can do but more cheaply?  What does economics have to say about this possibility, and what might our economic future look like?</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Audit design invokes a tradeoff between a monitor’s local knowledge and their independence from influence. We study this tradeoff in the context of a pilot program in six Chinese provinces in 2016, in which provincial governments were given control over budgeting and personnel decisions for city audits. Using a difference-in-differences framework we show that, compared to non-pilot provinces, centralization increases detection of suspicious expenditures by over 50%. These improvements occur also in cities with auditors appointed pre-2016, suggesting that stronger incentives and greater resources rather than auditor selection explain the improvements. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that financial (but not human) resources devoted to city audits increase with centralization. Further results show that centralization’s benefits are strongest in provinces that centralized audit office financing as part of the reform – particularly in poorer cities – suggesting a role for resources in improved performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taller people earn more, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We present among the first evidence of this phenomenon in Africa, using longitudinal microdata on a cohort of middle-aged Kenyan adults. We document a substantial height/earnings premium: controlling for gender, age, and other socio-demographics, monthly earnings increase by 1.07% per centimeter (or 2.72% per inch). Nearly half this effect can be explained by differences in cognition, measured from an unusually rich battery containing 27 modules. Additional shares of the premium can be attributed to measures of physical strength and non-cognitive ability. In contrast to prior work, we find little role for occupational sorting: conditional on cognitive and non-cognitive ability, taller people do not appear more likely to work in higher paid sectors. Leveraging repeated measures of height and an instrumental variables specification, we find suggestive evidence that measurement error may be attenuating the estimated relationship.</content>

    <title>Welfare Added? Optimal Teacher Assignment with Value-Added Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how teacher "value added" should inform optimal teacher-assignment policy. Our welfare-theoretic framework illustrates (1) how theoretically optimal assignments leverage variation in teachers' impacts both across student types and across different outcomes, and (2) how empirically optimal assignments trade off improved targeting from estimating richer student heterogeneity against increasing misallocation risk. In practice, optimal assignments use limited student types (only lagged achievement) and multiple outcomes (not just math). Even after correcting for policy overfitting, assignments raise average present-value earnings by $2,800 and increase lower-achieving students' earnings by 70-156% more than benchmark value-added policies that assume that teacher effects are homogeneous across students, that allow for heterogeneous effects across students but for a single subject, or teacher deselection.</content>

    <title>Driving Innovation: The Policy Tools Powering Electric Vehicle Technological Inventions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for cutting transportation emissions, yet the policy drivers of EV innovation remain underexplored. This study analyzes firm-level panel data on EV and battery patents, covering more than 4,000 firms across 19 countries from 2010 to 2021, to assess how these policy tools and their interactions in different time horizons influence innovative activity. We test the effects of individual policy instruments that either raise demand for EVs or support the development of EV technologies.  Stringent fuel-economy standards, financial incentives, adoption targets, and public R&amp;D investments each significantly increase patenting in EV and battery technologies. Moreover, long-term EV targets amplify the innovative impact of public R&amp;D and standards while diminishing the marginal effect of short-term price signals. The results suggest that governments can accelerate clean automotive innovation by combining long-term adoption commitments with sustained R&amp;D investment or strong performance standards, and by managing these instruments as a coordinated policy portfolio rather than as separate tools. The study contributes cross-country, firm-level evidence that links policy design to the direction of clean technology innovation.</content>

    <title>Clientelism: How It Works, Why It Persists and How to Break It</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter surveys the economics and political science literature on clientelism. We define clientelism as the exchange of votes or electoral participation for targeted material benefits and argue that it undermines electoral accountability, fostering rent-seeking and the underprovision of public goods. We document the prevalence of clientelism across countries and over time and examine how economic underdevelopment both facilitates clientelistic practices and may be perpetuated by them. We then analyze the agency problems that characterize clientelistic exchanges, focusing on broker–voter and politician–broker relationships, and review evidence on the roles of monitoring, selection, and social networks in sustaining these relationships. Finally, we discuss how clientelistic machines are financed, assess interventions aimed at weakening clientelism and promoting programmatic competition, and outline directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Mapping Technological Trajectories: Evidence from Two Centuries of Patent Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a methodology to measure cross-country trends in innovation capability - “technological trajectories” and implement this on a new rich dataset covering patents between 1836 and 2016 across multiple countries. Intuitively, trajectories are revealed by a country’s sustained increases in patenting across multiple patent offices. We first describe the data patterns, showing the relative decline of the UK, and the rise first of the US and Germany, and then later of Japan and China. We then econometrically estimate trajectories on (i) the post-1902 period for France, Germany, Japan, the UK and US, and (ii) the post-1960 period for a wider sample of 40 countries. Our trajectories are strongly positively correlated with Total Factor Productivity growth, and also (but less strongly) associated with the growth of labour productivity and capital intensity. We show that future trajectories are predicted by a country’s initial levels of R&amp;D, education and defence spending, classic drivers of innovation in modern growth theory.</content>

    <title>Wedges: A Microeconomic Perspective on Misallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter takes stock of what has been learned from the recent micro-development literature about wedges—mechanisms generating dispersion in marginal revenue products of factors across firms, which are commonly interpreted as indicators of misallocation. We present a general theoretical framework that allows us to consider several different types of wedges simultaneously. We argue that it is important to distinguish between between technological wedges, which are present even in the efficient allocation that would be chosen by the social planner, and distortionary wedges, which are present in market equilibrium but not the social planner's allocation. Not all wedges, as we have defined them, are distortionary. We also argue that interactions among wedges are pervasive. We review empirical findings about different types of wedges—taxes, regulations, political connections, corruption, market power, contracting frictions, upgrading investments, and search—focusing on studies that present direct evidence on particular wedges and how they generate dispersion in marginal returns to factors. Throughout, we pay special attention to how wedges vary with firm size and whether the evidence supports the “large firms are constrained” view of development. We conclude with thoughts about promising directions for the misallocation literature.</content>

    <title>Poverty and Dependency in the United States, 1939–2023</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare trends in absolute poverty before (1939–1963) and after (1963–2023) the War on Poverty was declared. Our primary methodological contribution is to create a post-tax post-transfer income measure using the 1940, 1950 and 1960 Decennial Censuses through imputations of taxes and transfers as well as certain forms of market income including perquisites (Collins and Wanamaker 2022), consistent with the full income measures developed by Burkhauser et al. (2024) for subsequent years. From 1939–1963, poverty fell by 29 percentage points, with even larger declines for Black people and all children. While absolute poverty continued to fall following the War on Poverty’s declaration, the pace was no faster, even when evaluating the trends relative to a consistent initial poverty rate. Furthermore, the pre-1964 decline in poverty among working age adults and children was achieved almost completely through increases in market income, during which time only 2–3 percent of working age adults were dependent on the government for at least half of their income, compared to dependency rates of 7–15 percent from 1972–2023. In contrast to progress on absolute poverty, reductions in relative poverty were more modest from 1939–1963 and even less so since then.</content>

    <title>Learning to Quit? A Multi-Year, Multi-Site Field Experiment with Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a randomized experiment with 553 science- and technology-based startups in 12 co-working spaces across the US to evaluate the effects of intensive, short-term entrepreneurial training programs on survival and performance for innovation-driven startups. Treated startups are more likely to shut down their businesses and do so sooner than control startups. Conditional on survival, however, treated startups are more likely to raise external funding for their ventures, raise funding faster, and raise more funding than the control group; they also exhibit higher employment and revenue. Treated founders are less likely to found a new startup after shutdown. Our findings are consistent with practitioner arguments that early entrepreneurship training interventions can help entrepreneurs with less viable ventures “rationally quit” (“fail fast”). We use machine learning techniques (causal random forest) to provide exploratory insights on the most impacted subgroups.</content>

    <title>The Redistributive Effects of Federal Medicaid Outlays Across Counties: Evidence from the ACA</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act reshaped federal transfer inflows to counties using state Medicaid expansions between 2014 and 2017. We show that the ACA expansion increased federal Medicaid transfers by $361 per capita in expansion counties. Using our estimates, we forecast that non-expansion counties would gain $554 per capita if they expanded Medicaid. These transfers flow to counties with lower tax capacity and lower gross income. Our findings suggest that Medicaid expansion was a health policy intervention that also functioned as a budgetary mechanism reshaping federal to local transfers and fiscal smoothing across U.S. counties.</content>
