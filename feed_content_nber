    <title>Navigating Medicaid: Experimental Evidence on Administrative Burden and Coverage Loss</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Millions of people lose access to safety-net programs each year because they do not complete the required administrative processes. In a large-scale field experiment, we randomized outreach offering personalized assistance during the Medicaid renewal window to identify the impact of transaction costs on coverage loss. Our intervention – which provided information and assistance – simplified the renewal process without affecting eligibility, ensuring that avoidable coverage loss among eligible beneficiaries accounts for any effects we find. Sending pre-recorded calls offering free one-on-one assistance from health insurance navigators increased Medicaid renewal by 1 percentage point, a 1.5% increase relative to the control arm. However, the phone number on file was likely no longer valid for at least one-fifth of beneficiaries, suggesting some people did not receive their calls. Receiving the call increased successful renewals the most for tribal members (by 8 percentage points or 13%) and children (by 3 percentage points or 4%); receiving the call also increased renewals for people with income below the sample median (by 2 percentage points or 4%) and people with chronic disease (by 3 percentage points or 4%). Together, these data suggest that some eligible people, including those who need care, lose Medicaid because they struggle with the required administrative processes. The findings do not support the typical rationale for allowing barriers or costs to enrollment—namely, that they efficiently discourage participation by those who do not need or value the benefits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign trade has significantly contributed to global improvements in living standards, a reduction in global inequality since the mid-1990s, and the lifting of millions out of extreme poverty. These gains were supported by the rules-based international order established after World War II. However, these achievements are now under threat. Escalating trade wars risk not only causing significant economic harm to both the United States and low-income countries, but also exacerbating geopolitical tensions.</content>

    <title>Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Firm Wage Premia</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper leverages a large minimum wage reform in Uruguay to study the effects of minimum wages on the distribution of firm wage premia. Wage inequality decreased substantially after the reform, with almost all of the decrease attributed to a reduction in between-firm inequality. AKM variance decompositions show that the relative variance of firm fixed effects substantially decreased after the reform. A time-varying AKM model reveals that this pattern was driven by a compression in the distribution of firm fixed effects, with low-paying firms increasing their fixed effect after the minimum wage increase. Both firm-level and worker-level difference-in-differences analyses show that the minimum wage reform had a causal effect on the compression in the distribution of firm wage premia. The results suggest that minimum wages can increase the supply of "good jobs" by "making bad jobs better", in addition to reallocating workers towards "good jobs".</content>

    <title>Endogenous Firm Ownership in General Equilibrium</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines firm ownership structures in competitive general equilibrium by introducing a model where ownership rights emerge endogenously rather than being assumed. By embedding the property rights theory of the firm into general equilibrium analysis, the model demonstrates how market forces determine both initial firm formation by entrepreneurs and subsequent trading of ownership rights. The key finding is that, in equilibrium, firms are created by managers who have long-term importance to performance, but these founder-managers then sell ownership to outside investors. This pattern emerges because managers can capture value through both the sale price and their ongoing employment relationship, while outside owners can only benefit through ownership. The model thus provides a novel theoretical foundation for observed patterns of entrepreneurial exit and reconciles competing approaches to firm ownership in general equilibrium theory. Additionally, it identifies a distinct economic definition of an entrepreneur as an agent whose human capital is valuable for firms even when they do not remain long-term owners. The framework generates insights into firm formation, ownership dynamics, and the nature of entrepreneurship while maintaining the core structure of competitive general equilibrium analysis.</content>

    <title>Union Bargaining Power and the Amenity-Wage Tradeoff</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how collective bargaining affects both wages and amenities. By merging collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) to linked employer-employee data in Brazil, I combine rich contracted amenities with wage information. I implement a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits a court ruling enforcing CBA continuation (i.e., ultractivity) to estimate the effects of union bargaining power. Strengthening unions raises wages and amenities without reducing employment—increasing retention despite some labor-labor substitution. A revealed preference approach shows that amenities account for 45% of total compensation gains. These findings suggest that collective bargaining can offset monopsony power, but employers retain the right-to-manage workforce composition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine disparities in acquittal rates and sentencing for Black and White soldiers in the US Civil War using all general courts-martial. We find that Blacks were disproportionately punished for group actions like mutiny and for violent crimes involving group violence, suggesting fears of large-scale rebellion influenced justice. However, we also uncover a system that was fair relative to many modern criminal courts in acquittals and in death sentences. The needs of the Army pushed towards fairness.</content>

    <title>Productivity and Wedges: Economic Convergence and the Real Exchange Rate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and the real exchange rate, specifically focusing on the convergence in price levels in Eastern European countries. While these countries have had significant convergence in GDP per capita (relative to the EU average) since the 1990s, convergence in real exchange rates for these countries stalled after the EU crisis. Using a standard theoretical framework, we estimate the main drivers of real exchange rates and show that a combination of productivity growth (Balassa-Samuelson effects) and labor market distortions help explain real exchange rate trends. We develop a structural two-country model that provides a rich decomposition of the long run determinants of the real exchange rate. Simulations based on observed sectoral productivities and labor market wedges show that the model can accurately account for the historical path of Eastern European real exchange rates, both before and after the EU crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program aims to reduce youth substance use by fostering multi-sector collaboration and implementing locally tailored strategies within the community. This study is among the first to evaluate the program’s impact on youth development outcomes in the United States. Using the Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) difference-in-differences (CSDID) estimator, we find that the DFC program significantly reduces drug-related juvenile crime and improves academic performance. The effects are particularly pronounced in communities where coalitions include government agencies, highlighting the critical role of institutional coordination in mobilizing local resources. We also explore behavioral mechanisms, documenting reductions in marijuana use and opioid-related inpatient hospitalizations. A cost-benefit analysis indicates substantial welfare gains, suggesting that early-life prevention represents a cost-effective investment in public health.</content>

    <title>Labor and Product Market Power, Endogenous Quality, and the Consolidation of the US Hospital Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing structural analyses of the harmful effects of market consolidation focus on either product or labor markets in isolation, ignoring that product market competitors often compete for workers as well. This paper develops a unified framework for merger evaluation, finding that firms' simultaneous exercise of oligopoly power in the product market and oligopsony power in the labor market amplifies the harm from mergers to both consumers and workers. The model also demonstrates how merger-induced gains in labor market power incentivize firms to reduce product quality, highlighting an additional channel for consumer harm. The model's predictions are tested and quantified in the context of the recent consolidation of the US hospital industry. Linking panel data from several sources on all US hospitals from 1996-2022, a difference-in-differences design is estimated for nearly 150 high-concentration within-market mergers. Hospital mergers significantly reduce patient volume, increase prices, reduce employment, lower wages, and deteriorate quality of care, resulting in higher patient mortality. After recovering the structural parameters, the estimated model replicates observed merger impacts. Counterfactual exercises reveal that ignoring increased labor (product) concentration would lead one to under-predict the harm of mergers to consumers (workers).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how parental income and family structure during childhood and adolescence affect adult income, emphasizing the timing of these effects. Using an ordered multinomial probability model with functional covariates, we find that these familial influences are strongest in middle childhood and adolescence. We also uncover a complementary relationship in the effects of income and family structure trajectories during key developmental periods. By flexibly controlling for personal and family characteristics using nonparametric methods, our approach effectively handles high-dimensional covariates. The results advance the understanding of intergenerational income mobility and highlight the long-term importance of familial conditions for adult economic success.</content>

    <title>Serial Acquisitions in Tech</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine serial acquisitions in the technology sector from 2010 to 2023. Defining serial acquisitions based on a granular S&amp;P industry taxonomy, we find that they account for 24–37% of majority-control tech M&amp;A, with over half completed by public firms. Followon targets in a series are generally larger and older than the initial acquisition, and among public acquirers, starting a series is associated with higher market value and greater innovation value, but not with significant changes in market competitiveness. Among deals with valid transaction values, over half of serial deals exceed the reporting threshold of the U.S. Hart–Scott–Rodino (HSR) Act. However, in below-threshold acquisitions, acquirers primarily target their core business category. Accounting for the cumulative value of a series would, in most cases, keep the timing of HSR review unchanged or modestly accelerate it, but when it does accelerate it, review could occur several deals or years earlier, potentially yielding important benefits in markets with long acquisition sequences. Finally, while Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM) stand out from the rest of the sample for more frequent serial acquisitions, some other large acquirers display similar patterns.</content>

    <title>Cumulative Risks of Foster Care Placement for U.S. Children: Comparing Birth Cohort and Synthetic Cohort Approaches</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foster care placement is a far-reaching intervention that can have substantial long-term effects on children and families. Lifetime prevalence estimates are based on synthetic cohort life tables, which rely on a stationarity assumption that age-specific rates are stable over time. This paper uses a birth cohort life table approach for the 2000-2002 cohorts, where data from birth to 18 years allows us to observe lifetime prevalence of foster care placement directly. We find that 5.0% of children born in these cohorts were placed in foster care, including 10% of Black children and 12% of Native American children, with considerable heterogeneity across U.S. states. By comparing both methods, we see that synthetic cohort estimates were 17% higher than birth cohort estimates because placement rates for teenagers were higher at the point of synthetic cohort estimation than during their actual teenage years. We extend synthetic cohort estimates to 2019 and find similar placement rates by sex over time, increasing shares of placements due to neglect and substance abuse, decreasing shares due to child behavioral issues, and an increasing share of placements into kinship foster care. These patterns are similar regardless of the approach.</content>

    <title>Does Tax Avoidance Trickle Down? Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The wealthiest individuals frequently engage in tax avoidance, and public awareness of this behavior is growing. Such awareness may undermine tax compliance among the broader population, either by revealing strategies others can emulate or by shifting social norms to make avoidance seem more acceptable. We first document that individuals are less tolerant of both tax avoidance and tax evasion when carried out by the wealthiest households. We next present results from a field experiment on property tax appeals, which—like other forms of tax avoidance—is used disproportionately by the wealthiest households. Providing information about the appeal rates of the richest-1% of households increased individuals’ perceptions of unfairness, but did not affect their own appeal decisions—measured via administrative records—or even their expected tax savings. Information about the prevalence of appeals among comparable households also had no effect. By contrast, information about the expected financial gains from appealing had a significant effect on appeal choices. In sum, while the public condemns tax avoidance by the wealthiest households, we find no sign that such behavior encourages similar actions among the broader population.</content>

    <title>Tariffs, Trade Wars, and the Natural Rate of Interest</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the effects of tariff changes and trade conflicts on the natural rate of interest? This article investigates this question, using a multicountry, heterogeneous-agent trade model in which the natural rate of interest is determined by firms’ demand for capital and households’ supply of assets through their savings behavior. We analyze how the equilibrium interest rate evolves during the transition to higher unilateral tariffs and a global trade war. In the short run, tariffs reduce capital demand, and so the natural rate of interest must fall for households’ asset supply to line up with capital demand. In the long run, both asset supply and capital demand fall by similar amounts, which leads to little change in the long-run natural rate of interest.</content>

    <title>Laboratories of Autocracy: Landscape of Central–Local Dynamics in China’s Policy Universe</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive collection of 3.7 million Chinese policy documents and government work reports spanning the past two decades, we identify 115,679 distinct policies and systematically trace their initiation and diffusion. Our analysis reveals three key findings. First, China’s policymaking has historically been highly decentralized, with local bureaucrats playing crucial roles in both creating new policies and spreading them. Second, since 2013, policymaking has become substantially more centralized, driven primarily by changing bureaucratic incentives—bottom-up innovation is no longer rewarded, while strict enforcement of central policies is. Third, our examination of industrial policies shows that centralization affects both policy suitability and effectiveness. Top-down industrial policies tend to align poorly with local conditions and are less effective at driving industrial growth, highlighting centralization’s costs. On the other hand, under decentralization, competition among local officials can distort policy diffusion, also undermining effectiveness. Our quantitative assessment of both distortions indicates that economic costs of centralizing policymaking in China have significantly outweighed its benefits.</content>

    <title>Expectation Response Functions in Dynamic Linear Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Macroeconomic disturbances affect both current fundamentals and expectations of future fundamentals, but most analyses report only the total of these effects. The expectation response function (ERF) isolates the role of expected future fundamentals in a theory. Defined as the response today to a change in expected fundamentals at each future horizon, the ERF does not depend on the fundamentals' laws of motion, the information held by agents, or the assumption of rational expectations. In applications, we show that (i) the new-Keynesian model implies modest expectational effects of technology and monetary shocks, while (ii) markup shocks in a medium-scale DSGE model have far larger expectational impacts than the “puzzling” effects of forward guidance.</content>

    <title>A Chip Off the Old Block? Genetics and the Intergenerational Transmission of Socioeconomic Status</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Progress in understanding the role of genetics in intergenerational socioeconomic persistence has been hampered by challenges of measurement and identification. We examine how the genetics of one generation influences the SES of the next by linking genetic data from the Dutch Lifelines Cohort to tax records for 2006-2022. Our genetic measure is the polygenic index (PGI) for educational attainment. To isolate causal genetic effects, we exploit randomness in genetic transmission across generations. One generation’s genetics impacts the education, income, and wealth of the next. A 10-percentile increase in one generation’s PGI raises next generation’s education by 0.11 years. “Next-generation genetic effects” are also large relative to “same-generation genetic effects”: a 10-percentile increase in a person’s PGI raises their income by 0.9 percentiles and their child’s by 0.7 percentiles, indicating strong persistence across generations. We next turn to mechanisms: about half of next-generation genetic effects reflect direct genetic inheritance (“genetic transmission”). The remainder operates through environmental pathways (“genetic nurture”): one generation’s genetics shapes the circumstances in which the next is raised. This environmental channel is reinforced by assortative mating: high-PGI individuals select more-educated, higher-earning partners. Our findings underscore that genetics is one of the forces anchoring SES across generations.</content>

    <title>The Algorithm Advantage: Ranked Application Systems Outperform Decentralized and Common Applications in Boston and Beyond</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School choice systems increasingly use common applications, where students can apply to multiple schools on a single form, though schools make admission decisions independently. We model three application systems: a common application, a decentralized system with costly separate applications, and a ranked-choice system using a matching algorithm. Our model shows that while a common application may expand access, it increases competition and may produce worse matches than a decentralized system where application costs encourage more selective applications. Ranked-choice systems combine reduced application costs with preference-based matching that reduce mismatches. We examine these predictions by analyzing how Boston's charter school sector was affected when it adopted an online common application.  Counterfactual simulations suggest the common application performs no better than alternatives on several metrics and did little to increase access for disadvantaged groups.  A ranked system consistently outperforms a common application across various levels of competition and assumptions on preference stability between application and enrollment stages.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the risk choices of a firm run by an effort and risk-averse manager, where the firm’s initial risk exposure is only observed by the manager. By eliminating zero NPV risk, hedging can improve the ability of firms to efficiently induce effort from their manager. We consider conditions under which information asymmetry about risk exposure alters the optimal compensation contract. In some settings, asymmetric information has no effect on the manager’s optimal compensation. However, in other settings, inducing the manager to hedge rather than speculate requires the optimal contract to directly account for hedgeable risk. When inducing the manager to hedge is sufficiently costly, the optimal contract may restrict the use of derivatives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many interventions that “work” in small-scale trials often fail at scale, highlighting the centrality of effective scaling for realizing the promise of evidence-based policy. We study the scaling of a personalized adaptive learning (PAL) software that was highly effective in a small-scale trial. We adapt the PAL implementation for scalability by integrating it into public school schedules, and experimentally evaluate this adaptation in a more representative sample over 20 times larger than the original study. After 18 months, treated students scored 0.22σ higher in Mathematics and 0.20σ higher in Hindi, a 50–66% productivity increase over the control group. Learning gains were proportional to student time on the platform, providing a simple, low-cost metric for monitoring implementation quality in future scale-ups. The adaptation was cost effective, and its key design features make it widely scalable across diverse settings.</content>

    <title>Place-Based Variation in Health Care: Evidence from Mandatory Movers in the U.S. Military Health System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is increasing evidence on regional variations in U.S. Medicare utilization based on older patients who move.  Yet evidence is limited for younger ages in the U.S., and movers may differ systematically from those who don’t move. In this paper, we harness the mandatory migration of military personnel and dependents (age 5 to 64) to estimate supply and demand factors in a system of care in which military physicians are salaried and copayments and deductibles are negligible. In our sample of 3 million enrollees, we find that place or supply effects explain as much as 80 percent of the overall regional variation for both the entire sample and for active-duty personnel. These regional place effects are correlated across age groups, with correlations as high as 0.84 between middle-aged and older military enrollees. These regional supply-side variations cannot be explained by differences in health, financial incentives, or quality of care, but appear consistent with location-specific differences in physician beliefs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a theoretical micro foundation for how much pollution (negative externalities) a firm will internalize based on the ownership distribution of its shareholders. Small shareholders, compared to large ones, want the firm to spend more on avoiding pollution since they suffer less profit loss for the same environmental benefit. In particular, if a shareholder holds a share of 1/N, where N is the population in society, that shareholder's preferences align with a social planner's. Three theoretical predictions arise. First, small shareholders will systematically vote for a greener corporate profile. Second, firms with a smaller weighted median shareholder will pollute less. Third, countries with concentrated corporate wealth holdings and/or more individualized firm ownership pollute more. This implies that standard models of externalities in environmental economics and macroeconomics containing representative agents are either internally inconsistent or not fully specified.</content>

    <title>A Discrete Choice Analysis of Consumer Decisions: Nicotine Products in an Illicit Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates consumer stated preferences for manufactured cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, and vapes in Türkiye, with a focus on how product attributes shape choices of adult consumers. A discrete choice experiment embedded in an online survey examines the role of prices of these products, flavor availability, and most importantly the legal status of vapes. Results indicate strong price sensitivity, both to own prices and to the prices of substitutes. In addition, legal status emerges as a critical factor that shapes stated preferences: consumers exhibit a marked aversion to products that are banned or sold illegally. However, scenario analyses suggest that vapes would capture a substantial market share even under strict prohibition. The hypothetical scenario of a complete ban would likely have a modest effect on the cessation of nicotine products while shifting choices toward traditional combustible tobacco products.  These findings highlight the limits of prohibition and underscore the importance of regulatory design. In particular, the treatment of legal status, together with pricing and taxation policies, plays a decisive role in shaping consumer behavior and public health outcomes.</content>

    <title>AI Agents for Economic Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The objective of this paper is to demystify AI agents - autonomous LLM-based systems that plan, use tools, and execute multi-step research tasks - and to provide hands-on instructions for economists to build their own, even if they do not have programming expertise. As AI has evolved from simple chatbots to reasoning models and now to autonomous agents, the main focus of this paper is to make these powerful tools accessible to all researchers. Through working examples and step-by-step code, it shows how economists can create agents that autonomously conduct literature reviews across myriads of sources, write and debug econometric code, fetch and analyze economic data, and coordinate complex research workflows. The paper demonstrates that by "vibe coding" (programming through natural language) and building on modern agentic frameworks like LangGraph, any economist can build sophisticated research assistants and other autonomous tools in minutes. By providing complete, working implementations alongside conceptual frameworks, this guide demonstrates how to employ AI agents in every stage of the research process, from initial investigation to final analysis.</content>

    <title>Beyond the Taylor Rule</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve partially "looked through" the post-Covid rise in inflation and ultimately managed to bring about an "immaculate disinflation." The Fed's policy deviated strongly from the Taylor rule during this period. More generally, central banks with strong inflation-fighting credentials looked through post-Covid inflationary shocks yet experienced less inflation than more hawkish but less credible central banks. In light of this episode, we assess the degree to which the Taylor rule is descriptive, and the degree to which it should be viewed as prescriptive. While the Taylor rule (generally) fits well during the Greenspan period, it (generally) fits poorly in the early 1980s and after the early 2000s. Academic work has emphasized the role of the Taylor rule in preventing self-fulfilling fluctuations (guaranteeing determinacy). These concerns can be addressed with a shock-contingent commitment and are fragile to deviations from fully rational expectations. We discuss three reasons why optimal policy may not always imply a one-for-one response of interest rates to inflation (forward guidance, correlated shocks, and "long and variable lags"). The main challenge arising from such policies is not indeterminacy but erosion of inflation-fighting credibility and potential deanchoring of long-run inflation expectations. Only central banks with strongly anchored inflation expectations and large amounts of inflation-fighting credibility are likely to be able to look through inflationary shocks.</content>

    <title>In Money, We Survive: The Effects of Social Security Retirement Income on Longevity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An old and debated line of research examines the income-mortality relationship and finds mixed evidence. In this paper, we re-evaluate previous studies using a new dataset and implementing a difference-in-difference model based on a Notch in Social Security retirement benefits to overcome selection and endogeneity issues. We employ Social Security Administration death records and find a positive income-longevity relationship. Moreover, we find more pronounced effects among low-educated individuals and people from low socioeconomic status families. Analyses using census data suggest that part of the reductions in retirement income are offset by wage income due to post-retirement labor force participation. Past age 80, the net adverse effects of the policy on both income and longevity become more pronounced.</content>

    <title>Malfunctioning Democracies: Understanding Accountability Failures in Developing Countries</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Claudio Ferraz &amp; Frederico Finan</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter examines why democracies in the developing world frequently underperform in providing effective governance. We argue that these shortcomings stem from weaknesses in accountability mechanisms, which leave governments vulnerable to corruption, clientelism, and elite capture. Our framework distinguishes three accountability channels: vertical (citizens’ control over politicians), horizontal (checks and balances across state institutions), and diagonal (oversight by media and civil society). We synthesize the recent theoretical and empirical literature to assess how each channel operates, the conditions under which it succeeds, and why it often fails. A central finding is that accountability institutions rarely fail on their own; instead, they are actively undermined by political actors seeking to preserve rents and entrench power. This dynamic weakens electoral competition, erodes judicial independence, and curtails media freedom, producing a mutually reinforcing cycle of weak accountability. Additionally, we argue that sustainable reforms cannot be achieved by strengthening any single channel in isolation. Since vertical, horizontal, and diagonal accountability are interdependent, effective reform requires bolstering all three simultaneously. We conclude by discussing the implications of this perspective for future research, including the role of new technologies, political polarization, and candidate selection in reshaping accountability in developing democracies.</content>

    <title>Understanding Patenting Disparities via Causal Human+Machine Learning</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an empirical approach for analyzing multi-dimensional discrimination using multimodal data, combining human perception measures with language-embedding-based, nonlinear controls for latent quality to relax restrictive assumptions in causal machine learning. Applying it to the U.S. patent examination process, we find that, ceteris paribus, applications from female inventors are 1.8 percentage points less likely to be approved, and those from Black inventors are 3 percentage points less likely—inconsistent with legally prescribed criteria. Jointly studying multiple bias dimensions and their intersections for the first time, we uncover new biases, including an affiliation bias—individual inventors are disadvantaged by 6.6 percentage points relative to employees of large, public firms, a disparity larger than any demographic gap. Moreover, innovation quality, location, and other factors can mitigate or compound discrimination, and the disparities interact: for example, racial gaps vanish among public-firm employees, masking more severe discrimination against individuals. Existing theories such as homophily cannot fully explain the results, but a simple model of correlation neglect does.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As shortages of resources like water and electricity due to extreme weather events become more frequent, high prices alone may fail to curb demand, making shortages more common. We examine a power limit policy for residential electricity households that rations electricity consumption rather than setting it to zero, as in a traditional rolling blackout. We find that power limits can provide equivalent savings to large blackouts, even when generous. Additionally, due to selection, power limits reduce the number of households affected by a shortage event. We conclude by discussing the welfare consequences of power limits and their heterogeneous impact across households.</content>

    <title>Earnings Instability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses high-frequency administrative data to show that the majority of U.S. workers experience substantial month-to-month fluctuations in pay, even within ongoing employment relationships. This earnings instability is pervasive, but it has been masked in past analysis of annual data. Moreover, this instability is unequally distributed: lower-income, hourly workers face more instability than higher-income, salaried workers. This is because earnings instability arises in large part from firm-driven fluctuations in hours. This earnings instability is a meaningful source of economic risk: we provide causal evidence that it increases consumption volatility and also leads to greater job separations, and we find that workers have a high willingness to pay to reduce earnings instability. These findings suggest that short-term earnings risk is a significant and previously underappreciated feature of the labor market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on the new integrated accounting framework of global supply chains (GSC) (Wang, Wei, Yu, and Zhu, 2025), we derive three types of economic dependence (producers’ dependence on upstream supplies, producers’ dependence on downstream markets, and consumers’ dependence on supply chains) that take into account of the presence of foreign invested firms as well as international trade. To measure indirect value flows between the origin and destination countries that are mediated through third economies, we show a need to go beyond both trade-in-value added and gross trade statistics. As an application, we derive new measures of inter-dependence between the United States and China.</content>

    <title>Characterizing Optimality in Dynamic Settings: A Monotonicity-based Approach</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel analytical method for studying optimal paths in dynamic optimization problems under general monotonicity conditions. The method centers on a locator function—a simple object constructed directly from the model’s primitives—whose roots identify interior steady states and whose slope determines their local stability. Under strict concavity of the payoff function, the locator function also characterizes basins of attraction, yielding a complete description of qualitative dynamics. Without concavity, it can still deliver sharp results: if the function is single crossing from above, its root identifies a globally stable steady state; if the locator function is inverted-U-shaped with two interior roots (a typical case), only the higher root can be a locally stable interior steady state. The locator function further enables comparative statics of steady states with respect to parameters through direct analysis of its derivatives. These results are obtained without solving the full dynamic program. We illustrate the approach using a generalized neoclassical growth model, a rational (un)fitness model, and a learning-by-doing economy.</content>

    <title>The Industrial Revolution in the United States: 1790-1870</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the distinctive trajectory of American industrialization up to 1870, emphasizing how the United States adapted and transformed British technologies to suit its unique economic and resource conditions. Rather than a straightforward transfer of innovations, the chapter argues that American industrial development was shaped by path-dependent processes and historical contingencies—such as the Embargo Act of 1807 and government sponsorship of firearms production—that enabled the emergence of a domestic innovation ecosystem. The chapter offers fresh insights into how high-pressure steam engines, vertically integrated textile mills, and precision manufacturing techniques evolved in response to labor scarcity, capital constraints, and abundant natural resources. A particularly novel contribution is the detailed analysis of how American manufacturers substituted mechanization and organizational innovation for skilled labor, leading to the development of technologies that were not only distinct from their British counterparts but also foundational for the Second Industrial Revolution. The chapter also highlights the democratization of invention, showing how economic incentives and institutional support fostered widespread innovation among ordinary citizens. By integrating technological, economic, and institutional perspectives, this chapter provides a compelling explanation for why the United States developed a robust manufacturing sector despite seemingly unfavorable initial conditions.</content>

    <title>Missing Markets for Innovation: Evidence from New Uses of Existing Drugs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For large classes of potential inventions, intellectual property rights that are available on paper are either not possible or not profitable for firms to enforce in practice. In this paper, we show that these missing incentives yield quantitatively significant underinvestment in research and development. We develop a simple model that formalizes the conditions under which such missing markets for innovation arise. We identify an empirical setting—research into new uses for existing drugs—in which there is sharp variation in the enforceability of intellectual property rights on otherwise comparable inventions over time. We show that when intellectual property rights become unenforceable, research investment and commercialization nearly cease. In doing so, we test two claims central both to our model and the innovation literature more generally—that stronger intellectual property protection does, in fact, induce investment, and that heterogeneity in the availability of these rights distorts investment. The welfare consequences of inadequate incentives in our empirical context are large. Our estimates suggest that 200-800 new uses for existing drugs would have been developed under counterfactual policies. Measures of the value of these uses drawn from existing literature suggest that the social cost of this particular missing market is on the order of several trillion dollars.</content>

    <title>Artificial Writing and Automated Detection</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly used for written deliverables. This has created demand for distinguishing human-generated text from AI-generated text at scale, e.g., ensuring assignments were completed by students, product reviews written by actual customers, etc. A decision-maker aiming to implement a detector in practice must consider two key statistics: the False Negative Rate (FNR), which corresponds to the proportion of AI-generated text that is falsely classified as human, and the False Positive Rate (FPR), which corresponds to the proportion of human-written text that is falsely classified as AI-generated. We evaluate three leading commercial detectors—Pangram, OriginalityAI, GPTZero—and an open-source one —RoBERTa—on their performance in minimizing these statistics using a large corpus spanning genres, lengths, and models. Commercial detectors outperform open-source, with Pangram achieving near-zero FNR and FPR rates that remain robust across models, threshold rules, ultra-short passages, "stubs" (≤ 50 words) and ’humanizer’ tools. A decision-maker may weight one type of error (Type I vs. Type II) as more important than the other. To account for such a preference, we introduce a framework where the decision-maker sets a policy cap—a detector-independent metric reflecting tolerance for false positives or negatives. We show that Pangram is the only tool to satisfy a strict cap (FPR ≤ 0.005) without sacrificing accuracy. This framework is especially relevant given the uncertainty surrounding how AI may be used at different stages of writing, where certain uses may be encouraged (e.g., grammar correction) but may be difficult to separate from other uses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;College loans serve as a double-edged sword for human capital investment: While they facilitate access to education, the burden of repayment may distort post-education investments in human capital. We examine the role of college loans and loan repayment policies through a structural model in which heterogeneous individuals, faced with borrowing limits, make dynamic decisions on consumption, borrowing/saving, labor supply, and costly human capital investment (via both college education and on-the-job learning a la Ben-Porath (1967)). We estimate two versions of the model using data from the NLSY79: one with natural borrowing limits and another with parameterized limits. Counterfactual simulations based on both models suggest that, relative to the standard fixed repayment plan, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans modestly increase educational attainment, lifetime earnings, and individual welfare. Although some generous IDR plans may result in losses for the loan program itself, overall government revenue is higher under IDRs than under the standard repayment plan when lifetime income taxes are accounted for, creating a win-win scenario for both individual welfare and government revenue.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how banks strategically develop brand images and how these efforts influence franchise value and the transmission of monetary policy. Analyzing TV advertisements via video embeddings, we measure banks' images along three dimensions: pricing advantages, service quality, and building trust and emotional connections. Banks with high local market shares highlight service and trust. Banks lacking pricing or service advantages lean on emotional appeals. Banks tailor images to demographics, increasing minority representation in targeted areas. A border discontinuity design helps identify that banks' images affect deposit growth, spreads, and loan demand, leading banks to respond differently to monetary policy.</content>

    <title>Robust Bounds on Optimal Tax Progressivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies optimal tax design when the cross-sectional distribution of types may be misspecified, and the government acts cautiously vis-à-vis these misspecifications. In models without such concerns, fat-tailed distributions imply positive—often high—top marginal tax rates. We demonstrate that even vanishingly small misspecification concerns overturn this finding, driving top marginal tax rates to zero. Calibrating concerns to observed variation in income distributions shows that taxes for below-average incomes remain essentially unchanged, while progressivity for high-income earners is substantially reduced.</content>

    <title>Global Working Hours</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses labor force surveys from 160 countries to build a new microdatabase on hours worked covering 97% of the world population in cross section. We also construct time series spanning over 20 years in 86 countries. Hours worked per adult are slightly bell-shaped with GDP per capita but weakly correlated with development overall. Hours worked by the young (aged 15-19) and elderly (aged 60+) decline with development, driven by growing school attendance and public pension coverage. Hours worked among prime-age adults (aged 20-59) are mildly bell-shaped with development for men while they are increasing for women. The fall in male hours in middle-to-higher income countries is driven by reduced hours per worker and is offset by increases in female labor force participation. These two forces have exactly compensated each other in many countries, leading to a remarkable long-run stability of prime-age hours worked. Labor taxes are strongly negatively correlated with prime-age hours worked both in international comparisons and overtime within countries. Controlling for government transfers only partly reduces the link between labor taxes and prime-age hours, ruling out substitution and income effects on labor supply as the only driver. Controlling for working hours regulations and the size of the formal sector eliminates this link, suggesting that regulations also play a large role in reducing intensive hours in higher-income countries.</content>

    <title>When Decentralization Works: Leadership, Local Needs, and Student Achievement</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies when decentralization improves public service delivery. I analyze a Chicago reform that awarded select principals greater autonomy over budgets and operations while holding resources largely unchanged. A meta-analysis of similar reforms shows substantial heterogeneity, including both positive and negative effects. Building on insights from public finance, contract design, and psychology, I argue that the returns to autonomy depend on the capacity of local decision-makers (i.e., principals in this context) and the alignment of their objectives with those of central authorities. Event-study estimates show that, on average, increased autonomy improved achievement by about 0.1 standard deviations, effects comparable to resource-intensive interventions but achieved at minimal cost. However, deconvolution analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity, with both negative and positive effects. Design-based evidence supports the theoretical predictions; high-performing principals benefit more, reallocating resources effectively (e.g., reducing class sizes), and schools with atypical student populations benefit more and may tailor services to local needs. These results highlight that local capacity, aligned incentives, and heterogeneity are central to the success of decentralization reforms.</content>

    <title>Job Mismatch and Early Career Success</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does being over- or underqualified at the beginning of a worker's career affect skill acquisition, retention, and promotion? Despite the importance of mismatch for the labor market, self-selection into jobs has made estimating these effects difficult. We overcome endogeneity concerns in the context of the US Air Force, which allocates new enlistees to over 130 different jobs based, in part, on test scores. Using these test scores, we create simulated job assignments based on factors outside of an individual's control: the available slots in upcoming training programs and the quality of other recruits entering at the same time. These factors create quasi-random variation in job assignment and hence how cognitively demanding an individual's job is relative to their own ability. We find that being overqualified for a job causes higher attrition, both during technical training and afterward when individuals are working in their assigned jobs. It also results in more behavioral problems, worse performance evaluations, and lower scores on general knowledge tests about the military taken by all workers. On the other hand, overqualification results in better performance relative to others in the same job: job-specific test scores rise both during technical training and while on the job, and these individuals are more likely to be promoted. Combined, these patterns suggest that overqualified individuals are less motivated, but still outperform others in their same job. Underqualification results in a polar opposite set of findings, suggesting these individuals are motivated to put forth more effort, but still struggle to compete when judged relative to others. Consistent with differential incentives, individuals who are overqualified are in jobs which are less valuable in terms of outside earnings potential, while the reverse is true for those who are underqualified.</content>

    <title>Adaptation Through Experience or Description? Evidence from an Experiment on Efficient Coding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The principle of efficient coding implies that the perception of monetary payoffs is shaped by the decision maker's prior beliefs. Specifically, payoffs that the decision maker expects to encounter more frequently should be perceived more accurately. Most previous tests of efficient coding rely on the decision maker's experience to shape the prior. We conduct a pre-registered experiment to test whether descriptive information about the prior affects behavior in a manner consistent with efficient coding. We randomize whether participants receive this information before the experiment begins. We find strong evidence for efficient coding; however, we detect no effect of information provision on behavior. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that experience quickly crowds out any effect of descriptive information on optimal allocation of coding resources.</content>

    <title>Public R&amp;D Meets Economic Development: Embrapa and Brazil’s Agricultural Revolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can public R&amp;D investment in developing countries drive productivity growth? We study this question in the context of Brazilian agriculture and the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa), a public research corporation established in 1973 to develop locally suitable science and technology. First, we show that Embrapa redirected research toward prioritized staple crops and local ecological conditions, and increased research productivity, especially in remote and research-scarce regions. Second, exploiting the staggered rollout of research centers alongside heterogeneous local exposure to Embrapa’s technology development, we find that Embrapa significantly increased agricultural output, driven both by higher productivity and expanded input use. Combined with a model, these estimates imply that public R&amp;D investment increased national agricultural productivity by 110% with a benefit-cost ratio of 17. The decentralized structure, in which research labs were spread across many ecological zones instead of in a single hub, explains a large share of these benefits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the evolving trends and policy dynamics of international student migration, focusing on their implications for STEM workforce development and innovation. While the United States has remained a leading destination for international students, recent years have seen a plateau or decline in incoming students, contrasted by growth in countries like Canada, Australia, and emerging hubs such as China and India. International students, particularly in STEM fields, play a critical role in shaping host countries' innovation ecosystems, often transitioning to permanent residents and STEM workers. We review immigration policies, including post-graduation work and residency pathways, highlighting their varying impacts on student inflows and innovation. Policies in Canada and Australia have until recently eased these transitions, while restrictive measures in the U.S. and U.K. have posed challenges. By documenting these trends and policy shifts, we identify gaps in the literature and outline directions for future research at the intersection of international education, immigration, and innovation.</content>

    <title>Efficiency Costs of Incomplete Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper quantifies misallocation caused by limited risk-sharing and imperfect consumption-smoothing. We measure these losses in terms of how much of society’s resources would be left over if financial markets were complete and each consumer were compensated to maintain their status-quo welfare. Using exact formulas and approximate sufficient statistics, we analyze standard incomplete-market environments—ranging from closed-economy Bewley-Aiyagari models to multi-country settings with input-output linkages. We find that incomplete insurance against household-level idiosyncratic risk is very costly—about 20% of aggregate consumption—based on both structural models and sufficient-statistics computed using household consumption panel data. By contrast, the cost of imperfect international financial markets (abstracting from within-country heterogeneity) is roughly 5%, driven by the inclusion of fast-growing economies such as China and India. Unexploited risk-sharing opportunities among countries at similar levels of development, on the other hand, are fairly limited (less than 1%).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use a dynamic general-equilibrium model with supply-chain adjustment frictions to  study the effects of tariffs on manufacturing employment. The model has four distinct  manufacturing sectors: upstream goods with high trade elasticities (“oil”); upstream  goods with low trade elasticities (“steel”); downstream goods with high trade elasticities (“toys”); and downstream goods with low trade elasticities (“cars”). I find that tariffs can increase overall manufacturing employment in the long run, but are likely to reduce it in the short run, and cause more reallocation of workers across these individual sectors than overall employment growth</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 1996, with United States fish populations in decline, Congress overhauled fishing laws with scientific thresholds for rebuilding overfished stocks. The law's impact is contested, and lawmakers have spent over a decade debating its reauthorization while countries around the world consider similar policies. We develop the first causally interpretable evaluation of this law, exploiting the fact that the European Union has comparable fisheries but only recently developed similar laws. Compiling comprehensive data on US and EU fishery status and management, we examine fish populations that decline to unhealthy levels and measure the effect of a policy that aims to rebuild them to health. We find treated populations increase by 52 percent relative to these counterfactuals, with both catch and revenue rebounding to baseline levels or greater. Analyzing fisheries' revenue, we find net present values are higher for at least 69 percent of rebuilt stocks compared to simulated counterfactuals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nursing homes face unique financial incentives that encourage under-investment in onsite clinical capabilities and overreliance on hospitals to triage and care for residents with dementia, contributing to high levels of health care spending for this population. A proposed solution to align incentives are Institutional Special Needs Plans (I-SNPs), which combine capitated financing with plan-provided onsite clinician presence. Using 12 million resident-quarters of data from 2016-2022, we exploit the timing of nursing homes’ I-SNP contracting to instrument for plan enrollment and estimate causal effects on hospitalization and other health outcomes. We found that I-SNP enrollment reduced quarterly hospitalization rates by 3 to 4 percentage points, which equates to one third of hospitalizations relative to the sample mean. We do not find consistent evidence of an impact on other health outcomes and quality of care indicators.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how foreign currency debt exposure shapes household adjustment to a large exchange rate depreciation. Using household survey and bank customer data during Hungary's 2008 currency crisis, we find that foreign currency borrowers cut consumption one-for-one with increased debt service, consistent with a foreign currency Fisher channel. Both the quantity and quality of expenditures decline, indicating a "flight from quality." Debt revaluation has a limited effect on overall labor supply, but there is substitution toward foreign income and home production. Our findings point to the relevance of open-economy models with incomplete markets, heterogeneous foreign currency exposures, and liquidity constraints.</content>

    <title>Should States Reduce Teacher Licensing Requirements? Evidence from the Rise of For-Profit Training Programs in Texas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of a Texas policy that relaxed teacher licensing requirements and created a large for-profit training industry. Using detailed administrative data, we show that for-profit-trained teachers have higher turnover and lower value-added than standard-trained teachers. But the policy significantly increased the supply of certified teachers, reducing schools' reliance on uncertified teachers with even worse outcomes. Exploiting variation in policy exposure across schools, we find a zero net impact on student achievement due to these offsetting forces. Thus lower licensing requirements improved access to teaching and reduced training costs without harming students.</content>

    <title>Happier at Work? The Impact of Working at an Employee-Owned Firm and Working from Home on Job Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of working for an ESOP firm and Working-From-Home (WFH) on job satisfaction in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and the General Social Science (GSS) survey.  It finds that job satisfaction is higher for employees in ESOPs than for observationally similar workers in non-ESOP firms and for WFH workers than for their non-WFH peers.  Fixed effect analysis of the NLSY97 finds that both ESOP and WFH employment raise job satisfaction for the same worker when he/she changes work status.  The channels through which the two conditions raise satisfaction appear to differ: ESOPs raise satisfaction by increasing worker participation on collective workplace or firm decisions while WFH raise satisfaction by increasing worker flexibility in their individual work activity.  Both participation and flexibility also raise job satisfaction independently. The data further show ESOPs had more extensive WFH than non-ESOP firms during the Covid-19 pandemic.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a new method to endogenously partition society into groups based on homophily in values, using fractional hedonic games as a theoretical foundation. The between-group differentiation that results from this partition provides a novel measure of latent polarization in society. We implement this method empirically using U.S. data from the World Values Survey. For the last forty years, the degree of latent polarization of the U.S. public has been high and relatively stable. In contrast, the degree of values polarization between voters of the two main political parties has steadily increased since the 1990s, and is now converging toward that of underlying values-based clusters. Thus, growing partisan polarization in the U.S. is a reflection of partisan views becoming increasingly aligned with the main values-based clusters in society.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can economic tools help inform the puzzlingly low rate of flu vaccination? Existing interventions focus on misinformation or nudges, not preferences over or beliefs about vaccine characteristics. Using an online experiment, we find a key role for effectiveness and short-run side-effects: equalizing only beliefs and preferences about these characteristics nearly eliminates the vaccination-intention gap between the vaccine hesitant and confident. Fear of needles, inconvenience, and perceived long run health risks play smaller roles. The vaccine hesitant hold pessimistic but plausible beliefs about effectiveness but greatly overestimate side-effect risks. We estimate the impact of correcting inaccurate beliefs and potential subsidies on vaccination rates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Parents are crucial to children’s educational success, but the role of parental education in fostering academic excellence remains underexplored. Using longitudinal administrative data covering all North Carolina public school students, we document five facts about first-generation excellence gaps. We find large excellence gaps emerge by 3rd grade across all demographics and persist through high school. Yet, socioeconomic status and school quality explain only one-third of the gaps. The overarching facts reveal that excellence gaps re-flect deeper challenges rooted in parental human capital that manifest early and compound over time, rather than merely consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage or school quality differences.</content>

    <title>Substituting Talent with Transactions: Acquisitions as Responses to Immigration Restrictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms respond to talent scarcity caused by restrictive immigration policies. We argue that when firms cannot build capabilities internally through hiring, they alter their boundaries by engaging in corporate acquisitions to make up for the foregone talent and capabilities. Using data on 3,861 U.S. firms and their use of the H-1B visa program (2001-2020), we leverage two exogenous shocks—the 2004 H-1B cap reduction and the 2007-2008 visa lottery—and find causal evidence that firms make more acquisitions as their exposure to immigration restrictions rises. This effect is stronger for deals with purposes related to the skills of the foregone talent, for small acquisitions, for domestic targets, and for targets in places with higher concentrations of skilled workers.</content>

    <title>Utilitarian or Quantile-Welfare Evaluation of Health Policy?</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Charles F. Manski &amp; John Mullahy</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an alternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and studied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision making under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility. That paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of quantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a cardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual decision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic theoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related specifically to health policy. We then propose a procedure to nonparametrically bound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice time-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health economists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning measurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.</content>

    <title>Segregation, Spillovers, and the Locus of Racial Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a discrete choice framework to provide the first nesting of Thomas C. Schelling’s canonical models of racial segregation amenable to empirical examination. Using U.S. Census data from 1970–2000, we demonstrate a central role for spatial racial spillovers in shaping racial clustering, patterns of racial shares and housing prices at the boundary of racial clusters, and the locus of racial change. Our results on the locus of racial change conflict strongly with prominent prior results on racial tipping. Our theory provides a foundation for spatially stratified regressions. The strongest spatial effects in the prior work are not tipping, but the distinct biased White suburbanization. Tipping effects in urban areas remote from Minority clusters are small or insignificant. In urban areas proximate to Minority clusters they average less than half those reported in prior pooled results. Policies promoting racial integration must thus attend to the heterogeneous fragility of neighborhoods.</content>

    <title>How People Use ChatGPT</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.</content>

    <title>Insuring Labor Income Shocks: The Role of the Dynasty</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide empirical evidence on the importance of a relatively understudied channel of insurance against labor income shocks: transfers from (cash-rich) parents to (cash-short) children when the latter experience negative wage shocks. Matching population data for Norway across two generations, we establish several results. First, parents make a transfer—i.e., run down liquid assets—when adult children experience negative labor income shocks. Consistent with dynastic insurance, we observe no transfers when income shocks are positive. Second, parents' responses depend on the nature of the shock. If losses are temporary, parents dissave; if they are persistent, parents save in order to make future transfers. Parental transfers offset 43% of temporary and 27% of persistent losses. Third, insurance is lower when children have other smoothing options, like spousal labor supply, and is greater for shocks to their own child versus a child’s spouse. Support also increases if the spouse’s parents can contribute, suggesting “competition for attention.” Lastly, insurance flows are one-way: children do not insure their parents against income losses.</content>

    <title>Business Owners and the Self-Employed: Thirty-Three Million (and Counting!)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs are known to be key drivers of economic growth, and the rise of online platforms and the broader "gig economy" has led self-employment to surge in recent decades. Yet the young and small businesses associated with this activity are often absent from economic data. In this paper, we explore a novel longitudinal dataset that covers the owners of tens of millions of the smallest businesses: those without employees.  We produce three new sets of statistics on the rapidly growing set of nonemployer businesses.  First, we measure transitions between self-employment and wage and salary jobs. Second, we describe nonemployer business entry and exit, as well as transitions between legal form (e.g., sole proprietorship to S corporation). Finally, we link owners to their nonemployer businesses and examine the dynamics of business ownership.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;If racial gaps in measures of human capital like educational attainment and standardized test scores were eliminated, what would happen to racial disparities in wages, employment, and other labor market outcomes? A credible answer to this question is foundational for understanding the nature and scope of racial inequality and discrimination in the United States. This article reviews and synthesizes a literature that studies this question by estimating the extent to which controlling for measures of human capital changes Black-white gaps in labor market outcomes, and discusses various conceptual and methodological issues related to interpreting this type of exercise. I show that while accurately interpreting this exercise and its many variants requires careful thinking, the results elucidate many important and subtle aspects of racial inequality in the United States.</content>

    <title>Time for Mental Healthcare: Evidence from Paid Sick Leave Mandates</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of state paid sick leave (PSL) mandates on mental healthcare use. To do so, we use all-payer health insurance claims data from IQVIA 2015-2022 combined with difference-in-differences methods. Findings suggest that overall mental healthcare use does not change post-PSL mandate. The null finding overall masks clinically relevant changes along the intensive margin: patients substitute away from lower levels of care to higher levels of care as time constraints are relaxed. Further, analysis of survey data hints that this change in treatment use improves mental health. Keywords: Paid sick leave; social insurance; social insurance.</content>

    <title>Deep Learning for Solving Economic Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, is transforming research across many fields, including economics. Its impact is particularly strong in solving equilibrium economic models. These models often lack closed-form solutions, so economists have relied on numerical methods such as value function iteration, perturbation, and projection techniques. While powerful, these approaches face the curse of dimensionality, making global solutions computationally infeasible as the number of state variables increases. Recent advances in deep learning offer a new paradigm: flexible tools that efficiently approximate complex functions, manage high-dimensional problems, and expand the reach of quantitative economics. After introducing the basic concepts of deep learning, I illustrate the approach with the neoclassical growth model and discuss related ideas, including the double descent phenomenon and implicit regularization.</content>

    <title>More to Live for: Health Investment Responses to Expected Retirement Wealth in Chile</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important but poorly understood way that economic development may influence health is through the private incentives that it creates for individuals to invest in their own health.  In this paper, we study how individuals' forward-looking health investments respond to changes in expected future (but not current) wealth. Focusing on institutional features of Chile's public pension overhaul in 1981, we link administrative microdata to a detailed household panel survey, and we then exploit discrete breaks in the resulting cohort pension wealth profile using a fuzzy regression kink design (RKD). Although theoretically ambiguous, empirically we find that greater expected pension wealth increases the use of important preventive medical care (and to a lesser extent, promotes more costly healthy lifestyle behaviors) – leading to measurable increases in chronic disease diagnosis (a requisite for appropriate disease management), reductions in disease prevalence, and measurably lower mortality in old age (particularly due to chronic diseases). In general, these results provide new evidence that economic development can have a meaningful incentive effect on health.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how abortion access affects economic hardship and crime. Using a database of abortion provider locations and operations in Texas from 2009–2019, we exploit variation in travel distance to the nearest facility created by clinic closures following the enforcement of Texas HB-2 in 2013. We confirm previous evidence that increased distance to the nearest abortion facility reduces abortions and increases births. We provide novel evidence that reduced access to abortion also leads to significant economic hardship, reflected in lower labor force participation, rising debt, widening income inequality, and heightened housing insecurity. This financial strain translates into higher rates of financially motivated crime, such as theft and burglary, with no significant effect on violent crime. These effects extend beyond directly affected individuals, reflecting intrahousehold spillovers. These findings suggest far-reaching consequences of restricted access to reproductive healthcare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic theory predicts that transformative technologies may influence interest rates by changing growth expectations, increasing uncertainty about growth, or raising concerns about existential risk.  Examining US bond yields around major AI model releases in 2023-4, we find economically large and statistically significant movements concentrated at longer maturities. The median and mean yield responses across releases in our sample are negative: long-term Treasury, TIPS, and corporate yields fall and remain lower for weeks.  Viewed through the lens of a simple, representative agent consumption-based asset pricing model, these declines correspond to downward revisions in expected consumption growth and/or a reduction in the perceived probability of extreme outcomes such as existential risk or arrival of a post-scarcity economy. By contrast, changes in consumption growth uncertainty do not appear to drive our results</content>

    <title>Inward and Outward Migration under Shifting Legal-Democratic Regimes</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Assaf Razin</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the two-way relationship between international migration and political regime change, highlighting a feedback loop in which political shifts shape migration flows, while migration itself reshapes political trajectories. Relying on a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework and a dataset combining migration flows, regime quality indicators (CHRI), and measures of international integration, we identify three central results.
First, substantial immigration into politically fragile democracies undermines institutional quality. The 2015 Syrian shock provides a particularly valuable exogenous case: a sudden, large-scale refugee inflow that bypassed domestic policy controls and provoked sharp political responses, allowing for clearer identification of immigration’s institutional effects. Second, democratic decline increases emigration, draining human capital and further weakening prospects for democratic recovery. Third, international integration—most notably through EU accession—conditions these dynamics, amplifying or dampening the outflow response to political change.
Taken together, these findings show that migration is not merely a symptom of political instability but also a driver of institutional transformation, simultaneously reinforcing and accelerating regime shifts toward illiberalism.</content>

    <title>The Theory of Financial Stability Meets Reality: A Unifying Framework for Bank Regulation and Accounting Discretion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature at the intersection of economics and finance offers prescriptions for regulating banks to increase financial stability. This literature abstracts from the discretion that accounting standards give banks over financial reporting, creating a gap between the information assumed to be available to regulators in models of optimal regulation and the information available to regulators in reality. We bridge insights from the economics, finance, and accounting literatures to synthesize knowledge about the design and implementation of bank regulation and identify areas where more work is needed. We present a simple framework for organizing the relevant ideas, namely the externalities that motivate bank regulation, the rationales for allowing accounting discretion, and the use of discretion to circumvent regulation. Our takeaway from reviewing work in these areas is that academic studies of bank regulation and accounting discretion require a more unified approach to design optimal policy for the real world.</content>

    <title>Automation-Induced Innovation Shift</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how exposure to automation affects the nature and level of corporate innovation, which informs how innovation begets innovation. We document that firms with high robot exposure alter their technological focus over time and shift innovative activities towards AI which automation naturally complements through data accumulation. The shift is more pronounced for firms with greater data generation or prior AI-related research experience. Because AI patents are more costly (e.g., in labor input), albeit more general and original, firms with high automation experience a significant rise in R&amp;D expenditure but an initial drop in patent quantity, before benefiting—an innovation “J-Curve.” Our findings not only resolve the puzzle that globally firms invent less despite the greater research effort amidst rising automation, but also provides insights on the heterogeneous paths of innovation, all of which we rationalize in a parsimonious dynamic equilibrium model.</content>

    <title>Social Substitution? Time Use Responses to Increased Workplace Isolation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how people adjust their time use when they experience an increase in time spent alone, which is a growing share of adults’ lives. We utilize the dramatic rise in remote work following the onset of the pandemic, which is associated with a large decline in time spent in the physical presence of non-household members during the workday, to observe the extent to which individuals substitute toward more in-person interactions in non-work settings. We first document that on days that individuals work from home, they spend 3.5 additional hours in activities spent entirely alone and over 5 fewer hours in activities that include any non-household members. We then use a difference-in-difference strategy to ask what happens to time allocations when workers are induced toward remote work by analyzing changes over time in how workers in teleworkable occupations—who experienced the lion’s share of the post-COVID increase in remote work—spend their time relative to workers in non-teleworkable occupations. Averaging over all days of the week, we see a relative increase in time spent in activities spent entirely alone by 32 minutes and a decrease in activities that include any non-household members by 38 minutes for workers in teleworkable jobs. Normalizing by the increase in average daily remote work time (46 minutes), these estimates are of a similar magnitude to what we observe in our descriptive analysis. When individuals are induced to work from home, they exhibit almost no substitution toward spending more time with others who are not in their household to make up for the loss of time with others at work.</content>

    <title>Measuring Neighborhood Change: The Issue of Ex Post Borders</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do more populous neighborhoods grow less quickly than less populous areas?  Is local housing price growth associated with initial population density? The Longitudinal Tract Data Base’s (LTDB) panel of Census tracts is the standard tool for measuring neighborhood change.  The LTDB is based on 2010 Census tract boundaries, and Census tracts are partially designed so that they have a similar level of population.  In this paper, we show that defining neighborhoods to equalize ex post population levels can significantly impact estimated coefficients in regressions in which population changes are regressed on initial population levels or with variables that are correlated with initial population levels.  Most obviously, if neighborhood populations are ex post equalized, then a regression of population change on initial population must yield a coefficient of -1. We address this challenge by offering five alternative panels of tracts using 1970, 1980 and 1990 boundaries, which can be thought of as ‘reverse LTDBs’.  The significant mean reversion of both population and housing units that appear in the LTDB before 2000 either dramatically ameliorates or reverses using the reverse LTDB.  Comparing the LTDB with the reverse LTDB also finds that using tracts based on ex post borders also can influence estimated growth relationships where other tract-level attributes such as house price are correlated with initial population levels. This does not imply that using ex ante borders always is superior; earlier borders almost always means fewer observations, especially in rapidly growing areas.</content>

    <title>Riding to Opportunity: Geographic and Household Effects from the Orphan Trains</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between 1854 and 1929, approximately 200,000 children were transported from East Coast cities to new homes in the American West, motivated by the theory that a change of geography and household environment can transform lives. We leverage quasi-experimental variation in child placements to evaluate both whether being sent West improved outcomes relative to remaining in New York institutions, and whether variation in destination and foster household characteristics affected later life success. Linking tens of thousands of ``orphan train'' riders and comparable non-relocated children to Census records through 1940, we find no systematic evidence that relocation itself improved adult economic outcomes. Among children sent West, substantial variation in county-level economic opportunities also did not predict adult success. In contrast, the individual foster household income predicts children's later incomes, with an estimated intergenerational elasticity of about 0.2.</content>

    <title>Supply-Side Opioid Restrictions and the Retail Pharmacy Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While policymakers routinely limit the sale of goods thought to be of risk to public health, relatively less is known about whether and how these policies affect firm performance. Using 2000-2018 National Establishment Time-Series data and a difference-in-differences strategy, we show that state “pill mill” laws intended to reduce the overprescribing of opioids reduced retail pharmacy sales and employment. These reductions were most pronounced in highly competitive areas and for standalone pharmacies – two characteristics associated with pharmacy drug diversion. Meanwhile, pharmacies located across the border in states without a pill mill law experienced increases in sales and employment. Next, we show that state pill mill laws were associated with an increase in standalone pharmacy closures, though the total number of pharmacies was unchanged. Our results are consistent with these laws adversely affecting pharmacies filling inappropriate opioid prescriptions without meaningfully altering patient access to retail pharmacies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inflation surged in 2021-2023 from a classic fiscal shock: money and debt that financed huge spending, without a plan for repayment. Neither money nor supply shocks offer a coherent alternative explanation. Inflation eased, with no recession, once the fiscal shock was over. Higher interest rates could have brought inflation down earlier, but could not have stopped it. Going forward, higher interest rates will raise debt service costs, and thus perversely raise inflation unless fiscal policy can tighten. High debt and structural deficits also mean that the US may lose the fiscal space to borrow in the next crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As we approach Transformative Artificial Intelligence (TAI), there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of how it could reshape our economic models, institutions and policies. We propose a research agenda for the economics of TAI by identifying nine Grand Challenges: economic growth, innovation, income distribution, decision-making power, geoeconomics, information flows, safety risks, human well-being, and transition dynamics. By accelerating work in these areas, researchers can develop insights and tools to help fulfill the economic potential of TAI.</content>

    <title>Drivers of Digital Payment Adoption: Lessons from Brazil, Costa Rica, and Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital payment platforms can displace cash and extend financial services to underserved populations, yet many adults worldwide remain unbanked. Leveraging granular microdata on individual transactions and user characteristics, we argue that broad cash substitution via peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms depends on a “rapid low income-gradient”, the speed at which adoption spreads from affluent early users to lower-income groups. In three Latin American cases, Brazil’s Pix, Costa Rica’s Sinpe Móvil, and Mexico’s CoDi, we document that low adoption costs, strong network effects, coordinated supply-side integration, and early awareness efforts enabled Pix and Sinpe Móvil to reach nearly all income segments within five years, whereas CoDi remains characterized by low usage and predominantly high-income adopters.</content>

    <title>Firm Capacity Underutilization and the Measurement of Productivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When estimating a production function, economists usually assume that firms fully employ all their available inputs. Contrary to this assumption, we document that underemployment of quasi-fixed inputs or low capacity utilization rates (CUR) is common across firms, especially in poor countries. Low CURs are correlated with supply-side constraints such as shortages of material inputs and electricity; they are also correlated with demand-side constraints such as a lack of access to markets. We show that when firms underemploy their quasi-fixed inputs, the assumptions behind standard production function estimation techniques-such as the control function approach-are invalid, and these techniques produce biased estimates of TFP. We demonstrate this using unique panel data from Ethiopia with information on actual and full capacity input demand. We find that measures of TFP that do not account for CUR considerably underestimate ’true’ productivity when CUR is low but not when CUR is high. This leads to an exaggeration of the TFP gap between rich and poor countries.</content>

    <title>Clean Rides, Healthy Lives: The Impact of Electric Vehicle Adoption on Air Quality and Infant Health</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first nationwide evidence on how electric vehicle (EV) adoption has improved both air quality and child health. We assemble a rich dataset from 2010–2021 that links county-level EV registrations to measures of air pollution, birth outcomes, and emergency department visits. The endogeneity of EV adoption is addressed using two complementary strategies: Two-way fixed effects and instrumental variables (IV).  The IV exploits the staggered rollout of Alternative Fuel Corridors as a source of exogenous variation in charging infrastructure that affected EV adoption. The estimates show that greater EV penetration significantly reduces nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a key pollutant linked to vehicular emissions. These improvements in air quality yield significant health benefits, including reductions in very low birth weight and very premature births, as well as fewer asthma-related emergency department visits among children ages 0 to 5. This is true even when potentially offsetting increases in pollution from the electricity generation needed to power EVs are accounted for.  The benefits are higher in the high-pollution counties with Alternative Fuel Corridors, where baseline exposures are greatest. The resulting reductions in very low birth weight births alone could generate annual benefits of $1.2 to $4.0 billion.  These findings underscore the dual environmental and public health benefits of EV adoption.</content>

    <title>Interest Rate Caps and Bank Loan Supply: Locking out the Small Borrower in the Great Depression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of changes in an interest rate cap on small loan brokers in New Jersey during the Great Depression. Using newly constructed data on brokers and banks, we find that small loans declined sharply when the cap was lowered, and despite worsening economic conditions, they rebounded when the cap was raised back up. Consumers could not obtain alternative credit from banks, effectively shutting them out of the market. The cap had a permanent impact on the small loan market due to the large number of broker closures, thereby further reducing the availability of small loans and increasing market concentration. Our findings highlight the fundamental trade-off faced by policymakers: strict rate caps may protect borrowers from predatory lending but can eliminate necessary credit options for vulnerable populations.</content>

    <title>Climate Risk Exposure and Firms’ Climate Strategies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When exposed to greater physical and transition climate risks, are firms more likely to engage in climate mitigation, climate adaptation, or/and political strategies? This study examines this question and finds that firms exposed to greater physical and transition climate risks are less likely to undertake substantial mitigation efforts. Instead, they pursue other strategies. Specifically, firms exposed to greater physical climate risks are more inclined to pursue adaptation strategies, while firms facing higher transition climate risks are more likely to engage in anti-climate political strategies (such as lobbying against climate policies). The intensity of how firms manage their climate risks is influenced by their time horizon: the more myopic they are, the less they engage in climate mitigation and the more they oppose climate-friendly policies, thereby decreasing transition risks today while worsening their exposure to future physical and transition climate risks. Overall, this study provides insights into the (lack of) preparedness of the corporate sector for heightened climate risks.</content>

    <title>Asset Elasticities and Currency Risk Transfer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use administrative security-level data from the U.S. and Euro Area (EA) portfolios to estimate asset demand and supply elasticities by exploiting exogenous variation in bond-specific currency wedges. Employing a Bartik-style shift-share identification approach, we document extensive heterogeneity in investor demand responsiveness to exogenous changes in the price of currency risk, conditional on the issuer characteristics. Demand for AE-bonds is always inelastic, whereas for EM-bonds, elasticity depends on investor type and currency: insurance/pension, nonbanks and banks have finite-elastic demand for EM-bonds that are issued in their own (investor) currency. For EM-issuer-currency bonds, only EA non-bank investors increase the share of these bonds in their portfolio when currency wedges widen, suggesting they accept higher currency risk for higher returns. In response, issuers adjust their supply endogenously: an exogenous increase of 8 basis point in currency wedges leads to a 0.26% decline in local currency bond issuance relative to GDP. We develop a theoretical framework where debt issuance decisions take into account heterogenous demand of investors in terms of their response to changes in the price of currency risk.</content>

    <title>The Changing Nature of International Trade and its Implications for Development</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the relationship between international trade, trade policy, and development in light of the structural, policy, and geopolitical shifts that have transformed globalization over the past decade. While trade has historically supported development through both static and dynamic channels, we argue that the latter—those inducing structural transformation and institutional change—have been far more consequential for long-run development. Through access to global markets, participation in global value chains, and knowledge and technology transfers, and by providing an anchor for reform, trade and trade agreements have contributed to productivity gains, technological progress, quality and skill upgrading, and institutional change in many low- and middle-income countries. Yet, the conditions that enabled these effects—technologically driven declines in transportation and communication costs, fragmentation of the production process, liberal trade regimes, multilateralism and geopolitical stability—are changing. Automation, digitization, climate change, the return of industrial policy in advanced economies, and the rise of geopolitical rivalry are reshaping the global trade environment. In this new context, the scope for replicating past export-led growth successes is unlikely as two key growth mechanisms, access to the lucrative markets of advanced economies and knowledge sharing, are under threat. We discuss whether trade in services and the green transition may offer new opportunities, emphasizing that future prospects will depend on policy choices in large economies and the adaptability of developing countries.</content>

    <title>How Do Financial Conditions Affect Professional Conduct? Evidence from Opioid Prescriptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how healthcare providers’ opioid prescriptions are affected by changes in their home values, which proxy for shocks to their wealth. We find that providers increase opioid prescriptions when experiencing adverse financial conditions. Results are robust to including provider office–year fixed effects and using the subsample of providers who live far away from their offices, thereby largely ruling out a patient–demand explanation. Providers living in ZIP codes with price changes in the bottom half in 2007–2009 increased their opioid prescriptions in 2010–2012 by approximately 16% more than others. The effect is stronger among providers facing more provider competition and those serving vulnerable populations. Providers experiencing adverse financial conditions also receive more opioid-related payments from pharmaceutical companies. We also extend our analysis to ADHD medications, demonstrating a similar pattern of increased prescriptions under negative financial shocks, suggesting broader implications for other medical decisions. Our findings offer novel insights into professional conduct under personal financial pressure, with implications extending beyond healthcare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Producers in locational pricing markets have the ability to exercise market power by impacting the extent to which transport capacity constraints bind. We extend the single-location residual demand curve concept to a residual demand hypersurface that quantifies the impact of a supplier’s output change at one location on prices at all locations. This concept improves our ability to explain the offers suppliers submit in the Italian locational pricing electricity market and demonstrates why the locations of a firm’s generation capacity determines the size and direction of locational price changes associated with the divestment of a fixed amount of generation capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using field-experimental data (study-time tracking and randomized incentives), we identify a structural model of learning. Student effort is influenced by external costs/benefits and unobserved heterogeneity: motivation (willingness to study) and productivity (conversion rate of time into skill). We estimate academic labor-supply elasticities and skill technology. Productivity and motivation are uncorrelated. Low productivity, not low motivation, is the stronger predictor of academic struggles. School quality augments productivity and accelerates skill production. We find that dynamic skill complementarities arise mainly from children’s aging and from a feedback loop between investment activity and productivity, rather than from carrying forward past skill stocks.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Technology Transfer: Multinational Investment in China and Rising Global Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;US multinationals formed joint ventures in China for market access and lower labor costs. However, these ventures transfer technology to Chinese firms, fueling future competition. While individual firms weigh the risks to their own profits, they disregard the negative impact on other US firms and the broader economy, resulting in an over-investment that may reduce the US welfare. In our empirical analysis, industries with more joint ventures in China show positive spillovers to Chinese firms but negative outcomes for firms in the US. We develop a two-country model with oligopolistic competition, innovation, and joint ventures. For the US, the short-run gains from joint ventures are outweighed by long-run losses due to rising Chinese competition. Joint ventures benefit large US firms at the expense of small firms and the real wages of workers. A ban on joint ventures since 1999 would have boosted US welfare by 1.2 percent.</content>

    <title>When Will Entrepreneurs Choose to Make Themselves Replaceable?</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines when and why entrepreneurs choose to standardise their ventures and make themselves replaceable, extending Rajan's (2012) analysis within a property rights framework. A model is developed where entrepreneurs face finite pools of potential replacements and may remain with their ventures post-IPO, rather than retiring as in Rajan's setting. The analysis yields two main results. First, when worker effort is fully contractible, entrepreneurs never choose to standardise, preferring to remain irreplaceable to maximise their bargaining power. Second, when key workers exert non-contractible effort that affects firm value, standardisation becomes beneficial as it motivates worker performance while managing the entrepreneur's replaceability. The optimal level of standardisation increases with the entrepreneur's equity stake, creating a ``dead zone" where entrepreneurs retain control but will not sell to outsiders. I extend the model to allow replacement of both entrepreneurs and workers, showing that standardisation can serve to reduce the bargaining power of all participants. The findings provide testable predictions about the relationship between equity structures, replacement market depth, and organisational design choices, while highlighting the strategic trade-offs entrepreneurs face between maintaining founder-specific advantages and creating transferable value for investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the effects of moving away from violent environments into safer areas on migrants' academic achievement in the context of the Mexican war on drugs. Using student location choices across space and over time, we recover individual-level migration paths for elementary school students across all municipalities in Mexico. We find that students who were induced to leave violent areas due to increased violence experience academic gains after relocating to safer areas.  Students who migrated from municipalities in the 90th percentile of the violence distribution to municipalities in the 10th percentile experienced improvements of 5.3 percent of a standard deviation in their test scores two years after they migrated. These results appear to be explained by increases in school attendance and improvements in the learning environment after they moved.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using individual-level data from the Add Health surveys, we leverage idiosyncratic variation in gender composition across cohorts within the same school to examine whether being exposed to a higher share of female peers affects mental health and school satisfaction. We find that being exposed to a higher proportion of female peers, despite only improving school satisfaction for boys, improves mental health for both boys and girls. The benefits are greater among boys of low socioeconomic backgrounds, who would otherwise be more likely to be exposed to violent and disruptive peers. We find suggestive evidence that the mechanisms driving our findings are consistent with stronger school friendships for boys and better self-image and grades for girls.</content>

    <title>The Downside of Fertility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The fertility decline is everywhere in the world today. Moreover, the decline goes decades back in the histories of rich countries. Birthrates have been below replacement in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1970s, although further declines occurred after the Great Recession. The reasons for the declines from the 1970s to the early 2000s involve greater female autonomy and a mismatch between the desires of men and women. Men benefit more from maintaining traditions; women benefit more from eschewing them. When the probability is low that men will abandon traditions, some career women will not have children and others will delay, often too long. The fertility histories of the U.S. and those of many European and Asian countries speak to the impact of the mismatch on birth rates. The experience of middle income and even poorer nations may also be due to related factors. Various constraints that I group under matching problems have caused fertility to be lower than otherwise and imply that fertility has a “downside.”</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the implications of sleepy deposits and their impact on competition, bank value, and financial stability in the US banking sector. We first document the shopping behavior of depositors using novel data on account openings and closures. Depositors infrequently shop for deposits, with 5–15% of depositors opening a new account each year. Shopping behavior is idiosyncratic: deposit accounts are more likely to be closed due to the depositor either moving or dying than because the depositor switched to a new account offering higher rates or better services. Building on these facts, we develop an empirical model of the supply and demand for "sleepy deposits." In the model, banks face dynamic "invest-versus-harvest" incentives in competing for depositors who shop infrequently. We estimate the model and find that depositor sleepiness accounts for 58% of the average bank’s deposit franchise value. Sleepiness softens competition, particularly raising markups and franchise value for banks in low-concentration areas, as well as for banks with either low-quality deposit services or high marginal costs. Sleepiness also creates stability in the banking sector. For two main money center banks in the US, the probability of default after the Federal Reserve's 2022-2023 hiking cycle would have increased to more than 20% in a counterfactual without sleepy depositors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks can use the discount window to fend off a run by prepositioning assets with the Fed and borrowing against them. Following the March 2023 bank runs, policymakers have considered mandatory prepositioning, arguably the largest update to the lenderof-last-resort toolkit in over a century. We study the forces that shape the largest banks’ prepositioning. We show that run-prone uninsured-deposit flows causally drive prepositioning and that banks face a prepositioning stigma, even absent borrowing. Prepositioning is no panacea—banks still need good assets to borrow against—but it can help at the margin.</content>

    <title>Prescription for Disaster: The SSDI Rate, Pain, and Prescribing Practices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A county’s fraction of adults in 1990 on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a strong predictor of growth in local drug death rates after 2000.  The part of the SSDI rate related to drug deaths is not proxying for well-known contributors to the drug crisis, e.g. OxyContin.  Instead, it appears to capture the fraction of people in chronic pain.  We show that in the late 1990s, physicians began prescribing opioids more aggressively to treat pain. Taken together, our estimates suggest that drug deaths rates would be 43% lower in 2015 had prescribing practices stayed at 1995 levels.</content>

    <title>Inferring Fine-grained Migration Patterns across the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fine-grained migration data illuminate important demographic, environmental, and health phenomena. However, migration datasets within the United States remain lacking: publicly available Census data are neither spatially nor temporally granular, and proprietary data have higher resolution but demographic and other biases. To address these limitations, we develop a scalable iterative-proportional-fitting based method that reconciles high-resolution but biased proprietary data with low-resolution but more reliable Census data. We apply this method to produce MIGRATE, a dataset of annual migration matrices from 2010-2019 that captures flows between 47.4 billion pairs of Census Block Groups — about four thousand times more granular than publicly available data. These estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets, and improve accuracy and reduce bias relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze both national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document temporal and demographic variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance: for example, we find that people are increasingly likely to move to top-income-quartile CBGs and identify racial disparities in upward mobility. We also show that MIGRATE can illuminate important local migration patterns, including out-migration in response to California wildfires, that are invisible in coarser previous datasets. We publicly release MIGRATE to provide a resource for migration research in the social, environmental, and health sciences.</content>

    <title>Why Is Manufacturing Productivity Growth So Low?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the recent slow growth in manufacturing productivity. We show that nearly all measured TFP growth since 1987—and its post-2000s decline—comes from a few computer-related industries. We argue conventional measures understate manufacturing productivity growth by failing to fully capture quality improvements. We compare consumer to producer and import price indices. In rapidly changing industries, consumer price indices indicate less inflation, suggesting mismeasurement in standard industry deflators. Using an input-output framework, we estimate that TFP growth is understated by 1.7 percentage points in durable manufacturing and 0.4 percentage points in nondurable manufacturing, with no mismeasurement in nonmanufacturing industries.</content>

    <title>From Kin to Creed: Missions and the Reconfiguration of Social and Moral Order in Colonial Congo</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how colonial religious institutions reshaped traditional social structures in Africa. Focusing on the Congo, I examine the long-term effects of Christian missions that sought to replace kin-based authority with European-Christian notions of social and moral order. I combine newly digitized data on historical mission locations with an original survey of 975 respondents, measuring attitudes toward family and coethnics, social network composition, referral behavior in a job experiment, and moral values. To address concerns about endogenous mission placement, I construct two counterfactuals: missions that were initially established but later abandoned, and simulated locations that were historically suitable but never selected. I find that exposure to missions persistently reduced bias toward kin and coethnics and weakened the role of kinship ties in networks and referrals. It also eroded communal moral values, such as loyalty to one's group and deference to authority, without a corresponding rise in universal moral principles. Instead, these shifts reflect a redirection of identity and moral obligation from kinship and ethnicity toward religious affiliation. Historical records on mission personnel and infrastructure point to religious instruction and education as key transmission channels. Together, the findings suggest that colonial religious institutions profoundly reshaped the social and moral organization of colonized societies.</content>

    <title>Congestion Pricing, Carpooling, and Commuter Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on the canonical "bottleneck" model of Vickrey (1969), we show that carpooling and road pricing are highly complementary in addressing traffic congestion: they can be much more effective jointly than each one separately, and can improve commuter welfare without having to rely on the redistribution of government revenue. By contrast, technological advances that make time in traffic more comfortable or productive (e.g., self-driving cars), implemented without additional economic incentives, may result in zero improvement in social welfare.</content>

    <title>Test-Optional College Admissions: ACT and SAT Scores, Applications, and Enrollment Changes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses data from the largest college application platform in the U.S. to describe application and enrollment changes in response to widespread test-optional admissions adoption between 2018-2021. Although test-optional policies aimed to expand college access, underrepresented students did not apply to Elite colleges at higher rates and Elite colleges still received large numbers of high-scoring applications after tests became optional. Despite the oversupply of high-scoring applicants in the test-optional period, Elite colleges enrolled more lower-scorers with high grades, in particular first-generation and lower-income students. Enrollment in less selective colleges also increased among high-scorers, so test-optional policies may exacerbate undermatching.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence in Team Dynamics: Who Gets Replaced and Why?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in organizations. We ask: (1) How should a principal optimally deploy limited AI resources to replace workers in a team? (2) In a sequential workflow, which workers face the highest risk of AI replacement? (3) How does substitution with AI affect both the replaced and non-replaced workers’ wages? We develop a sequential team production model in which a principal can use peer monitoring—where each worker observes the effort of their predecessor—to discipline team members. The principal may replace some workers with AI agents, whose actions are not subject to moral hazard. Our analysis yields four key results. First, the optimal AI strategy stochastically replaces workers rather than fixating on a single position. Second, the principal replaces workers at the beginning and at the end of the workflow, but does not replace the middle worker, since this worker is crucial for sustaining the flow of information obtained by peer monitoring. Third, the principal may optimally underutilize available AI capacity. Fourth, the optimal AI adoption increases average wages and reduces intra-team wage inequality.</content>

    <title>Scale Economies, Input-Output Loops, and Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the equilibrium and welfare implications of quantitative trade models with sector-level external economies of scale (EES). While empirical evidence highlights the importance of EES, prior work has examined their effects only in models without input-output linkages. Focusing on a small open economy, we derive an intuitive condition for equilibrium uniqueness that links trade elasticities, scale elasticities, and input-output coefficients. We further show that this same condition guarantees positive gains from trade, regardless of a country’s pattern of specialization.</content>
