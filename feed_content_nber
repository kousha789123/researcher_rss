    <title>Exorbitant Changes in Three Parts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that the positive differential on international portfolio returns, one aspect of the U.S. exorbitant privilege, has disappeared in three parts. Part One: U.S. international liabilities used to be mostly in low-return bonds while its international assets were largely in high-returning equities, thus naturally producing a positive return differential. More recently, however, U.S. equity liabilities have increased sharply, reducing this compositional tailwind. Part Two: While the exorbitant privilege literature has focused on expected returns as proxied by the sample arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is also required to produce an unbiased estimate of expected returns. Incorporating geometric means greatly reduces the returns differential. Part Three is a combined switch a) from aggregate to comprehensive security-level data to more accurately calculate returns and b) from expected to actual realized returns that take into account the timing and magnitude of portfolio flows. The combined effect of these changes is that over the past two decades the U.S. portfolio returns differential was not 228 bps but zero, and it is expected to be zero for the next decade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows responsive caregiving enhances children's brain development, with parental knowledge predicting positive behaviors and outcomes. However, knowledge varies widely across educational levels, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. Despite evidence that this knowledge can be improved, no comprehensive metric exists for efficient assessment. We introduce SPEAK (Survey of Parent/Provider Expectations and Knowledge), a computer-adaptive tool grounded in item-response theory that we created, to address this gap by measuring parental and educator knowledge across development domains with precision and speed. This paper details SPEAK's development, including domain construction, cognitive interviewing, expert review, psychometric calibration, and validity evidence. SPEAK offers a flexible, scalable solution for clinical, educational, research, and policy settings. By identifying knowledge gaps, it enables tailored interventions, supports professional development, and informs policy, ultimately improving parent-child interactions and child outcomes. Our tool bridges critical gaps in assessing child development knowledge, advancing research and cross-sector collaboration to promote early childhood development worldwide.</content>

    <title>A Guide to Climate Damages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multiple lines of research aim to quantify the economic impacts of climate change, including through reduced-form and structural approaches. We show that the effects of climate change on economic activity depend on changes in weather across time and space: changes in contemporary weather have direct effects on output; changes in past weather and in expectations of future weather induce adaptation; and changes in weather elsewhere around the globe introduce a general equilibrium component. Using this framework, we argue that estimation of climate impacts faces a trilemma: a methodology can have at most two of (i) robustness to a particular economic model structure, (ii) interpretation as effects of persistent, widespread, anticipated climate change, and (iii) quasi-experimental identification. We summarize the literature on climate damages in light of the trilemma, with an emphasis on recent progress understanding adaptation and spatial spillovers.  We propose directions for future work.</content>

    <title>What is More Important for Subjective Longevity Expectations: Perceived Health or Income?</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>V. Kerry Smith</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research considers the role of income for subjective longevity assessments. The analysis uses the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. My findings indicate that treating subjective health and longevity assessments as jointly determined is important to understanding the role of income for both judgments. Income has a positive effect on health judgments and does not have a statistically significant effect on subjective longevity when health is rated as excellent or good. Surveys framing the longevity question in direct or probabilistic terms may have complementary roles in estimating subjective longevity.</content>

    <title>Who Rides Out the Storm? The Immediate Post-College Transition and its Role in Socioeconomic Earnings Gaps</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite a large earnings premium for bachelor’s degree completion in general, graduates from low-income families earn substantially less than graduates from high-income families. While prior research has documented the role of college quality and major choice in explaining these gaps, we examine undermatching on a different margin: the first (post-college) job transition. The transition from college to the labor market can be challenging to navigate, and students with financial, informational, or other disadvantages during the job search may be more likely to “undermatch” to their first job. Using administrative data from a large, urban, public college system, we document large gaps in earnings five years after graduation by SES (proxied by financial aid receipt) that remain unexplained even after controlling for GPA, college, field of study, and other pre-graduation characteristics. We then examine how features of the initial job transition relate to longer-term earnings, and to what extent differences in the first job transition can explain later SES earnings gaps. Our results show that first job transitions are rocky for many graduates, strongly predict earnings at Year 5, and are a substantial mediator of socioeconomic gaps in earnings five years after college graduation—reducing the unexplained gap by almost two-thirds.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Romantic Relationships with the Boss</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Romantic relationships in the workplace are common, but those between managers and subordinates have increasingly drawn scrutiny. Using administrative data on the universe of cohabiting couples in Finland, we examine the career implications of starting or ending a personal relationship with a workplace manager and the spillovers of these relationships on the broader workforce. An event study design reveals that entering a relationship with a manager increases the subordinate's earnings by 6%, but breaking up triggers an abrupt 18% earnings decline. We also find that these relationships generate spillovers: retention of other workers declines by six percentage points, with effects concentrated in workplaces where subordinates experience greater earnings gains. Our findings highlight both the private benefits and organizational costs of hierarchical workplace relationships.</content>

    <title>Banking Crises, Nonlinear Export Elasticities, and the Dominant Currency Paradigm</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dominant currency paradigm posits that dollar invoicing reduces the potency of exchange rate depreciations in boosting export volumes. This implies that export elasticities with respect to the exchange rate are small, rendering even large depreciations ineffectual in the short term. We incorporate two innovations versus existing work. First, we allow for nonlinearities, permitting large depreciations to disproportionately lift exports. Second, we control for banking crises, which accompany many depreciations. Our baseline export elasticity—without nonlinearities or banking crisis controls—is -0.3, consistent with prevailing “elasticity pessimism.” This elasticity rises to between -0.5 and -0.8 within two years for depreciations above 20 percent without banking crises.</content>

    <title>Historical Government: Origins, Evolution and Varieties</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter reviews the origins, evolution, and modern forms of government, and proposes a research agenda. It contends that rather than being a homogeneous form of patrimonialism, early government was diverse and, at times, fostered order and prosperity. Its subsequent development did not follow an ‘evolutionary’ path to rational-legal government but was characterized by innovation and frequent collapse. Successful modern states do not all look alike, but follow several different models, as historical states have done.</content>

    <title>Information, Spillovers, or Hassle Costs? Effects of Medicaid Prior Authorization on Preschool Antipsychotic Prescribing</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine information versus hassle costs in the context of Medicaid prior authorization requirements for preschool antipsychotic prescribing. Such prescribing increased in the 1990s, despite substantial side effects and the absence of FDA approval. State Medicaid programs began to require prior authorization for antipsychotic prescribing to young children after 2005. We evaluate these policies using hand-collected policy data and national prescription data for 2006-2019. We find that prior authorization reduced prescriptions to children under six by 22-30% in the two years after implementation. There were no effects on privately insured or older children, suggesting little role for information spillovers.</content>

    <title>Government Recommendations and Health Behaviors: Evidence from Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide novel evidence on how healthcare decision-making responds to changes in government recommendations by studying the United States Preventive Services Task Force’s 2009 decision to stop recommending mammogram screenings for women aged 40-49. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that the guideline revision reduced mammography among 40-49-year-old women by 6-10 percent (from a baseline rate of 48.8 percent) relative to their older counterparts. We also identify large spillovers onto women aged 30-39 who were subsequently 25 percent less likely to receive a mammogram recommendation (from a baseline rate of 22.8 percent) and up to 60 percent less likely to receive a mammogram (from a baseline rate of 12.6 percent). Additional analyses suggest the revision reduced overdiagnosis of early-stage tumors. Finally, we find that the 2009 update increased confusion about recommendations for preventing cancer.</content>

    <title>Community Rating and Vertical Price Distortions in Insurance Menus</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Honglin Li, Chenyuan Liu &amp; Justin R. Sydnor</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does community rating distort relative prices for vertically differentiated plans in insurance markets? We show that common community-rating approaches can distort price differentials in the opposite direction to the distortions in overall price levels. Partial age-based community rating in the U.S. private health insurance exchanges causes older individuals to pay marginal prices for generous coverage significantly above marginal cost, while younger enrollees are subsidized on the margin. These distortions are large enough that older individuals often face and sometimes choose dominated options. We present simulations and theoretical discussions of community rating’s impacts on efficiency and distributional outcomes.</content>

    <title>Transshipment Hubs, Trade, and Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The majority of global trade moves by sea through hub-and-spoke shipping networks. We investigate the returns to being a hub country by analyzing how transshipment activity shapes trade and supply chains. We show that most US imports---especially from smaller origin countries---are transshipped via key hubs, and transshipment is positively correlated with the hub's product-level trade. Leveraging the indirect shipping network structure to construct an instrument, we find that transshipment increases hubs' imports from origins for which they facilitate trade and exports of downstream goods, highlighting their central role in shaping modern global trade and supply chain dynamics.</content>

    <title>Social Costs of Work Disruptions: Evidence from Physicians and their Patients</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work disruptions among women are common and costly for workers and firms, but do consumers also shoulder some of these costs? We study the impact of physicians’ births—a large, temporary shock to women’s labor supply—on their patients’ access to care, using administrative Medicaid claims data from California. Female physicians reduce their office visits by 85% in the quarter after giving birth, but return nearly to pre-birth levels within two years. These supply disruptions generate persistent effects on child patients: those whose primary care physician gives birth are less likely to see their usual physician for up to two years and receive less preventative care, including a 50% reduction in vaccination claims and a 42% reduction in lead testing. In contrast, we find little impact on adult patients. The lasting effects on children coincide with fewer pediatrician encounters overall, consistent with limited availability of substitute providers and the central role of pediatricians in monitoring children’s preventative care. Our findings demonstrate how shocks to women’s labor supply can generate persistent consumer welfare losses.</content>

    <title>China’s Lending to Developing Countries: From Boom to Bust</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Sebastian Horn, Carmen M. Reinhart &amp; Christoph Trebesch</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides a comprehensive overview of China’s lending to developing countries—a central feature of today’s international financial system. Building on our previous research and the work of others, we document the scale, destination, and terms of China’s overseas lending boom, as well as the lending bust and defaults that have followed. We compare China’s lending boom to past boom-bust cycles and discuss the implications of China’s rise as an international creditor on recipient countries and sovereign debt markets. The evidence indicates that Chinese state banks are assertive and commercially sophisticated lenders. For recipient countries, however, the jury is still out: it remains to be seen whether the gains from China’s lending—through growth and improved infrastructure—will outweigh the more immediate burdens of debt service or the multifaceted costs of default.</content>

    <title>Optimal Trade Policies and Market Power in General Equilibrium Trade Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We derive optimal trade policies in a multi-country, multi-sector general-equilibrium model that unifies a wide range of supply-side assumptions. Under our CES supply system, which nests most existing specifications, two-country optimal tariffs and export taxes across sectors depend only on elasticity parameters and relative market shares. With multiple countries, country and sector interdependencies—due to the cross-country trade network—make optimal tariffs imposed by the home country differ across countries and sectors while converging within sectors. Only when foreign countries do not trade with each other do the home country’s optimal policies depend solely on bilateral trade. Using trade data, we quantify optimal policies and find that ignoring interdependencies can lead to substantially lower welfare gains for the home country.</content>

    <title>The Global Economic Impact of Climate Change: An Empirical Perspective</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Solomon Hsiang</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical research has revolutionized how we understand the global economic impacts of climate change. Recent empirical analyses have tested theoretical ideas, challenged prior estimates, and revealed important and unexpected impacts. Further, the credibility and replicability of empirical results have played a critical role in guiding high-stakes climate policies. Here, I describe the landscape of empirical economic research on global impacts, I explain elements of modern analyses, I summarize recent findings on a range of topics, and I point towards promising new areas of investigation. In particular, I focus on empirical perspectives for six “grand challenges” in the field: understanding climate change’s global impact on economic output, health, conflict, food security, disasters, and migration. Overall, I argue that interwoven empirical findings across outcomes are aligning to paint an increasingly coherent picture of a future global economy impacted by climate change. Taking the literature as a whole, the global consequences of unmitigated climate change are likely to be substantial, unequal, negative in net economic value and potentially destabilizing.</content>

    <title>The Economic Geography of American Slavery</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What would the antebellum American economy have looked like without slavery? Using new micro-data on the U.S. economy in 1860, we document that where free and enslaved workers live and how much they earn correlates strongly—but differently—with geographic proxies for agricultural productivity, disease, and ease of slave escape. To explain these patterns, we build a quantitative spatial model of slavery, where slaveholders coerce enslaved workers into supplying more labor, capture the proceeds of their labor, and assign them to sectors and occupations that maximize owner profits rather than worker welfare. Combining theory and data, we then quantify how dismantling the institution of slavery affected the spatial economy. We find that the economic impacts of emancipation are substantial, generating welfare gains for the enslaved of roughly 1,200%, while reducing welfare of free workers by 0.7% and eliminating slaveholder profit. Aggregate GDP rises by 9.1%, with a contraction in agricultural productivity counteracted by an expansion in manufacturing and services driven by an exodus of formerly enslaved workers out of agriculture and into the U.S. North.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This brief survey reviews recent work on transportation in poor and middle-income countries. After reviewing a few key global facts and taking stock of the data available, it focuses on eight key themes that are emphasized in this literature relative to work on transportation in rich countries. In urban areas, these are private/informal transit, interactions with other informal markets, gender, bus rapid transit, and quantity-based congestion policy. Elsewhere, they are the legacy of colonialism, rural roads, and potential negative effects of improved transportation infrastructure.</content>

    <title>What the Mercantilists Got Right</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economics students today learn about mercantilism through Smith’s prism, as a series of logical and policy errors that Smith clarified and settled for good. But far from settled doctrine, mercantilism encapsulated a variety of pragmatic practices that survived Smith’s critique, often to good effect. It found echo in a continuous tradition of what later came to be called “developmentalism,” running from Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List’s advocacy of trade protection to Hans Singer and Raul Prebisch’s ideas on import-substitution and, more recently, to East Asian models of export-oriented industrialization. Three of its core tenets hold continued appeal: the primacy of production and jobs (and of their composition) over consumption; preference for close, collaborative relationship between business and government over an arms’ length relationship; and the need for contextual, pragmatic, and often unorthodox policies over universal remedies and “best-practices.”</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility, extending the static model of Shapley and Shubik (1971). Forward-looking agents have individual states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching market with market-clearing prices takes place. We prove the existence of an equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and show it is the solution to a social planner’s problem. We also prove that a stationary equilibrium exists. We introduce econometric shocks to account for unobserved heterogeneity in match formation. We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary equilibrium. We adapt both algorithms for estimation. We estimate a model of accumulation of job-specific human capital using data on Swedish engineers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the prices of financial options to study the value of macroeconomic data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  I show that options traders expect several data products to contain information relevant to valuations of firms throughout the economy.  The most affected firms tend to be larger and more capital-intensive.  Traders especially anticipate data releases in more recent years and in periods of high uncertainty about economic policy.  Traders expect more relevant information from U.S. government data products than from Federal Reserve policy statements and minutes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human capital formation enhances worker productivity and firm performance. However, firms may not fully internalize the financial benefits from investing in employee skill-building, which can disincentivize worker training and suggest roles for government support. We examine such tradeoffs in the context of physician training (i.e., “residency” programs). Using the universe of Medicare inpatient and outpatient records from 2014-2019 and differences-in-differences analyses, we show that hospitals’ productivity and revenues grow by 10-20% after underwriting a procedure-oriented residency––though heterogeneity exists. The hospitals benefiting from trainee labor conservatively net over $2 million in steady-state, revealing substantive private incentives to finance physician training.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many communities across the United States have elected reform-minded prosecutors who seek to safely reduce the reach and burden of the criminal justice system. In this paper, we use variation in the timing of when these prosecutors took office across jurisdictions to empirically characterize their policy changes and estimate downstream effects on prison incarceration rates, local reported crime rates, and drug mortality rates. We find that after a reform prosecutor takes office there are consistent and often statistically significant decreases in charging and conviction rates for nonviolent misdemeanor offenses, particularly misdemeanor drug offenses, but not for violent or felony offenses. We find little to no downstream effects on prison incarceration rates and no effects on local reported crime rates or drug mortality rates. These findings suggest that the types of policies being implemented by reform prosecutors appear to be decreasing the footprint of the criminal justice system without adverse effects on public safety.</content>

    <title>The Lower Boundary of Workplace Mistreatment: Do Small Slights Matter?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research in psychology, management, and more recently in economics, highlights the role of individual managers and their behavior in shaping employee performance. While emerging literature on harmful managerial behavior has focused primarily on severe forms of workplace mistreatment, especially various types of harassment, much less is known about its boundary conditions: How minor can a manager’s bad behavior be and still negatively affect employee performance? We study what appears to be a very minor workplace mistreatment—failing to deliver an expected birthday gift and greeting card on time—and examine its effect on subsequent employee performance. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences approach with detailed data from a national retail chain, we find that this small slight leads to over a 50% increase in employee absenteeism and a reduction of more than two working hours per month. Our analysis suggests that emotional responses to perceived workplace mistreatment drive the results. These findings indicate that even modest slights can meaningfully harm employee performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This narrative paper provides a detailed account of the Great Inflation in the United Kingdom from 1961 to 1997, serving as a companion to the analytical account of fiscal policy presented in Bordo, Bush, and Thomas (2025). We discuss the background fundamentals in place at the outset of the Great Inflation and document the distinct phases of inflation, the unique features of the UK’s experience relative to other advanced economies, and the interplay between fiscal, monetary, and incomes policies. By placing the UK’s inflationary episodes within their institutional and historical context, this paper offers a qualitative perspective that complements the quantitative analysis of the main paper and informs ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of persistent inflation.</content>

    <title>Tolls on Entrepreneurs from Capital Market Distortions: Evidence from IPO Locational Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capital controls and other policy distortions in the capital market are costly to entrepreneurs. We propose a structural estimation approach to quantify the effect using IPO locational choices. We estimate the willingness-to-pay to bypass these distortions by the Chinese entrepreneurs with overseas listed firms to be a haircut in firm value by 50-60%. We infer that the welfare for the entrepreneurs could rise by 22% from the relevant capital market reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In China, only 37% of divorce petitions citing domestic violence are granted, with evidence suggesting that judges often prioritize preserving marriages even in cases of abuse. We investigate whether judicial decision-making can shift in response to broader social change. Exploiting the rise of the #MeToo movement, which reshaped societal perceptions of gender-based violence, we find that female judges in China became 8 percentage points more likely to grant divorces in domestic violence cases. These results suggest that judicial attitudes and actions on gender-based violence cases are malleable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effects of teaching negotiation skills to adolescent girls in economically vulnerable compounds in Lusaka, Zambia ten years later. Treated participants complete 0.27 more years of education. Consistent with greater relational empowerment, they also begin sexual activity later, marry later, have smaller age gaps with their husbands, are less likely to report a high likelihood of having HIV, and express less traditional gender attitudes. Social benefits and costs from HIV reduction and increased education suggest the intervention generated 7.8-16.2 dollars for every dollar spent and may have paid for itself in government revenues.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cities across America are adopting civilian crisis response programs as alternatives to traditional policing, yet causal evidence on their impact and cost-effectiveness is scarce. This paper evaluates Durham, North Carolina’s HEART program, which diverts nonviolent 911 calls from police. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that HEART reduces crime reports, arrests, and response times—primarily through civilian phone and in-person responses, rather than police-civilian co-responses. The program increases future 911 calls, which suggests it fosters public trust. Based on an original contingent valuation survey and applying the marginal value of public funds framework, we conclude that HEART is a fiscally self-sustainable intervention.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the role of banking supervision in anticipating, monitoring, and disciplining failing banks. We document that supervisors anticipate most bank failures with a high degree of accuracy. Supervisors play an important role in requiring troubled banks to recognize losses, taking enforcement actions, and ultimately closing failing banks. To establish causality, we exploit exogenous variation in supervisory strictness during the Global Financial Crisis. Stricter supervision leads to more loss recognition, reduced dividend payouts, and an increase in the likelihood and speed of closure. Increased strictness entails a trade-off between a lower resolution cost to the FDIC and reduced credit.</content>

    <title>Asset Returns as Carbon Taxes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In frictionless financial markets, a carbon tax on energy users provides the same incentives as a replicating asset price schedule that depends on emissions. In particular, the replicating rate of return on a firm increases linearly in scope 1 emissions relative to enterprise value. We use this result to interpret pollution premia measured by recent empirical studies and conclude that markets currently provide only modest incentives. Replicating a serious carbon tax requires high returns in the right tail of the emission intensity distribution. With heterogeneous investors, such returns are not sustainable unless essentially everyone perceives large nonpecuniary costs from holding dirty capital. Substantial emission reductions can be achieved, however, when even a small share of investors perceive nonpecuniary benefits from owning clean electricity capital.</content>

    <title>Measuring What Matters: Why Italy May Be in Better Fiscal Shape than the US</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study uses fiscal gap accounting (FGA) and generational accounting (GA) to compare US and Italian fiscal solvency. FGA and GA incorporate all government outlays and receipts, whether put on or kept off the books. FGA measures, in the form of reduced net outlays, the constant share of each future year’s GDP needed to balance the government’s intertemporal budget. GA calculates the lifetime net tax rate – lifetime taxes divided by lifetime labor earnings -- facing future generations if current generations pay nothing more, on net, than current policy mandates. Deficit accounting suggests that Italy’s 135 percent debt-to-GDP ratio places it in worse fiscal shape than the US with its 123 percent ratio. But on a fiscal-gap basis, Italy appears in far better shape regardless of the discount rate used. Based on the theoretically appropriate rate – the average real return to national wealth, the U.S. fiscal gap is 7.4%. Italy’s is 4.0%. These requisite solvency adjustments are far larger if delayed or if the UN’s more pessimistic demographic projections prevail. Neither country can expect future generations, on their own, to cover their government’s red ink. Doing so requires levying lifetime net tax rates, in each country, that exceed 100%.</content>

    <title>Perceptions of Public Debt and Policy Expectations: Evidence from Cross Country Surveys</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilizing large-scale surveys of over 27,000 respondents across 13 advanced and emerging market economies conducted between April and May 2024, we examine how knowledge, beliefs, and preferences regarding government debt shape expectations about tax and spending policies. Our findings reveal significant gaps in public understanding of fiscal policy. Individuals consistently underestimate debt levels, particularly in high-debt countries, and tend to believe that fiscal adjustments will disproportionately affect them. We further show that greater lifetime exposure to fiscal consolidation is associated with increased pessimism about future economic prospects, reduced trust in government, and heightened expectations of rising debt, future tax increases, spending cuts, and inflation. Through randomized controlled experiments, we assess the causal impact of providing information about actual debt levels on household expectations. Informing respondents about their country’s debt levels lowers expectations of tax increases in contexts of stable debt and raises expectations of spending cuts in countries with rising debt. The effect of this information is moderated by individuals’ past experiences with fiscal consolidation, underscoring the interplay between historical context and current perceptions of fiscal policy.</content>

    <title>Heterogeneity in Vertical Foreclosure: Evidence from the Chinese Film Industry</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do vertically integrated firms' pricing and product provision decisions change with upstream and downstream competition? We answer this question in the context of the Chinese film industry. Theaters allocate significantly fewer showings to non-integrated films. This foreclosure effect is particularly pronounced in two scenarios: when an integrated theater faces limited spatial competition, and when an integrated film is similar to competing films. To measure welfare effects, we estimate a model of consumer preferences and theater showings choice using a novel method that combines standard demand data with film ratings data. Our results show that integrated theaters internalize a substantial portion of their upstream profits, driving foreclosure behavior that distorts showings. Counterfactual simulations show that  vertical integration increases consumer welfare by 2.4% in the median market, but reduces consumer welfare in 7% of markets. The welfare effects of foreclosure vary with upstream competition between films and downstream competition between theaters, and we show that targeted antitrust policy that removes of integration based on measures of market competition can substantially increase welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides systematic evidence on the macroeconomic consequences of war using a new dataset covering 115 conflicts and 145 countries over the past 75 years. We document three main findings. First, conflict generates large and persistent real effects: real GDP falls by 13% on average with no recovery even after a decade, while investment collapses as financial frictions reduce domestic credit. The drop in real activity is more pronounced for civil wars than it is for interstate conflicts. Second, government finances deteriorate as revenues contract while expenditures remain stable, thus raising primary deficits. Real government debt also declines, and governments shift 1.2% of GDP towards short maturities. Third, governments rely heavily on inflation to finance their deficits: the price level and money supply both rise by nearly 50%, eroding debt and generating seigniorage but also depressing investment and raising the cost of imported capital goods.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Cellphone Bans in Schools on Student Outcomes: Evidence from Florida</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cellphone bans in schools have become a popular policy in recent years in the United States, yet very little is known about their effects on student outcomes. In this study, we try to fill this gap by examining the causal effects of bans on student test scores, suspensions, and absences using detailed student-level data from Florida and a quasi-experimental research strategy relying upon differences in pre-ban cellphone use by students, as measured by building-level Advan data. Several important findings emerge. First, we show that the enforcement of cellphone bans in schools led to a significant increase in student suspensions in the short-term, especially among Black students, but disciplinary actions began to dissipate after the first year, potentially suggesting a new steady state after an initial adjustment period. Second, we find significant improvements in student test scores in the second year of the ban after that initial adjustment period. Third, the findings suggest that cellphone bans in schools significantly reduce student unexcused absences, an effect that may explain a large fraction of the test score gains. The effects of cellphone bans are more pronounced in middle and high school settings where student smartphone ownership is more common.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we quantify the distortions induced by career concerns within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We combine a structural approach with an unanticipated change in the information available to the public about internal committee deliberations. We show that—given the policy preferences of Fed Presidents and Board Governors serving in the FOMC—agents' incentives to appear competent and unbiased outweigh the distortions induced by anti-pandering and conformity. Relative to a counterfactual with no reputational considerations, career concerns improve the welfare of an unbiased principal. Given our estimates of career concerns, Transparency improves welfare relative to an Opaque regime in which internal deliberations are not made public. In a counterfactual exercise, we show that greater heterogeneity in regional shocks reduces conformity but increases policy errors under Transparency.</content>

    <title>Log-Linear Relative Asset Demand</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the theoretical underpinnings of log-linear models of relative asset demand. It shows that log-linearity provides a poor approximation - in both a global and local sense - to asset demand functions implied by standard portfolio optimization theory. Instead, log-linearity is consistent with a model of portfolio choice in which the investor views the payoffs of different assets, within any state of the world, as being imperfectly substitutable. Equilibria in this model, and all other models that generate log-linear relative asset demand, are generically inconsistent with the existence of a positive stochastic discount factor. I argue that these results imply that the demand system asset pricing approach represents a radically new way to interpret financial market data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the effects of tariffs along the supply chain using product-level data from a large U.S. wine importer in the context of the 2019-2021 U.S. tariffs on European wines. By combining confidential transaction prices with foreign suppliers and U.S. distributors as well as retail prices, we trace price impacts along the supply chain, from foreign producers to U.S. consumers. Although pass-through at the border was incomplete, our estimates indicate that U.S. consumers paid more than the government received in tariff revenue, because domestic markups amplified downstream price effects. The dollar margins per bottle for the importer contracted, but expanded for distributors/retailers. Price effects emerge gradually along the chain, taking roughly one year to materialize at the retail level. Additionally, we find evidence of tariff engineering by the wine industry to avoid duties, leading to composition-driven biases in unit values in standard trade statistics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s unprecedented expansion of higher education in 1999, increased annual college enrollment from 1 million to 9.6 million by 2020. We trace the global ripple effects of that expansion by examining its impact on US graduate education and local economies surrounding college towns. Combining administrative data from China’s college admissions system and US visa data, we leverage the centralized quota system governing Chinese college admissions for identification and present three key findings. First, the expansion of Chinese undergraduate education drove graduate student flows to the US: every additional 100 college graduates in China led to 3.6 Chinese graduate students in the US. Second, Chinese master’s students generated positive spillovers, driving the birth of new master’s programs, and increasing the number of other international and American master’s students, particularly in STEM fields. And third, the influx of international students supported local economies around college towns, raising job creation rates outside the universities, as well. Our findings highlight how domestic education policy in one country can reshape the academic and economic landscape of another through student migration and its broader spillovers.</content>

    <title>Ads as Cues</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do we see both advertising and powerful consumer habits for well-known and intrinsically similar brands? We offer an explanation based on the idea that, as in Bordalo et al. (2020), a consumer is more likely to demand a good if she recalls the pleasure it gave her in the past. In turn, the consumer is more likely to recall goods that are consumed more frequently and more similar to cues, subject to interference from other goods. Our model yields context-dependent brand habits where ads work as memory cues. It predicts that ads: i) are more effective for more habitual consumers and ii) exhibit spillovers, within and across products, that are stronger for more habitual consumers and for goods with more similar ads. Using data from NielsenIQ and Nielsen we find support for these predictions in 20 undifferentiated and highly advertised product categories. Memory offers new insights on how advertising affects market competition and consumer welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use recent advances in natural language processing and large language models to construct  novel measures of technology exposure for workers that span almost two centuries. Combining our measures with Census data on occupation employment, we show that technological progress over the 20th century has led to economically meaningful shifts in labor demand across occupations: it has consistently increased demand for occupations with higher education requirements, occupations that pay higher wages, and occupations with a greater fraction of female workers. Using these insights and a calibrated model, we then explore different scenarios for how advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are likely to impact employment trends in the medium run. The model predicts a reversal of past trends, with AI favoring occupations that are lower-educated, lower-paid, and more male-dominated.</content>

    <title>Ordinary Life Insurance: The Best-Performing Financial Asset of the 1930s</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From 1900 to 1940, ordinary working- and middle-class families saved for retirement and contingencies via ordinary life insurance policies. These policies combined insurance and savings in a single financial instrument that paid its face value to insured individuals who survived until maturity and to beneficiaries if the insured died before the maturity date. The popularity of these policies peaked before WWII when a substantial share of all households and most of the middle class invested in them. This paper explains why these policies were the most popular savings vehicle of their day. Ordinary life policies were well suited to the early twentieth-century economic environment. They had good returns; low risks; tax advantages; and little correlation with returns of competing investments, like bank deposits, building and loan shares, postal savings deposits, real estate, or stocks. The policies protected households from poverty in old age, from the premature death of their breadwinner, and from other risks including disability and deflation. Understanding how households saved in the past has implications for a wide range of literatures in the social sciences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the optimal path of Social Security benefits for an individual who has retired with a stock of wealth, faces stochastic mortality, and has no access to annuities and no preferences for bequests? It is a deferred annuity in which the government annuity pays out zero for some periods and a constant amount after that. The optimal length of the deferral period is increasing in the retiree's initial wealth and in their survival probability.</content>

    <title>Disentangling Age, Time, and Cohort Effects in Income Inequality: A Proxy Machine Learning Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A canonical finding from earlier research is that the cross-sectional variance of income increases sharply with age Deaton and Paxson (1994). However, the trend in this age profile is not separately identified from time and cohort trends. Conventional methods solve this identification problem by ruling out "time effects." This strong assumption is rejected by the data. We propose a new proxy variable machine learning approach to disentangle age, time and cohort effects. Using this method, we estimate a significantly smaller slope of the age profile of income variance for the US than conventional methods, as well as less erratic slopes for 11 other countries.</content>

    <title>Contractibility Design</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a model of incentive contracting in which the principal, in addition to writing contracts, must engage in contractibility design: creating an evidence structure that allows them to prove when the agent has breached the contract. Designing an evidence structure entails both (i) front-end costs borne ex ante, such as those of drafting contracts, and (ii) back-end costs borne ex post, such as those of generating evidence. We find that, under even small front-end costs, optimal contracts are coarse, specifying finitely many contingencies out of a continuum of possibilities. In contrast, under even large back-end costs, optimal contracts are complete. Applied to the design of procurement contracts, our results rationalize: (i) the discreteness of contracts, (ii) the presence of similarly vague contracts in low-stakes and high-stakes settings, and (iii) the discontinuous adjustment of contracts to changes in the economic environment.</content>

    <title>Children Are Bridges to Heaven: The Effects of Fertility on Later-Life Mortality</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Several competing theories in a number of disciplines point to a possible influence of fertility history on health and mortality. However, the direction of effects is theoretically a-priori unknown and the empirical evidence is also inconclusive. This paper examines the effects of fertility during midlife on later-life longevity using Social Security Administration death records linked with the full-count 1940 census. We tackle endogeneity and selection concerns in the longevity-fertility association by implementing an instrumental variable based on the sex composition of first two children. Our findings indicate that having an extra child is linked to a decrease in women’s longevity by approximately 5 months. Men, on the other hand, experience smaller and insignificant reductions in longevity of about 3.3 months. This divergence in effects suggests that biological factors may play a small role in the relationship between fertility and later-life longevity.</content>

We examine quasi-option value in the context of gray wolf eradication, which aimed to protect humans and their property historically, but also reduced the potential for wolves to improve human well-being today. We estimate the effects of long-run differences in the presence of wolves north, but not south, of Canada’s Saint Lawrence River on animal-related (primarily deer) vehicle collisions. Wolves reduce the share of animal collisions by 38 percent, reducing risk to human life and property.</content>

    <title>The Social and Individual Effects of Homeless Shelter: Evidence from Temporary Shelter Provision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What does homeless shelter achieve? We leverage administrative records of homeless services in Los Angeles County to construct a novel dataset of daily, site-level counts of shelter beds and occupants from 2014 to 2019. We pair this with daily, block-level crime incident data and daily, hospital-level data on ER visits to assess the relationship between shelter and area crime and health. We exploit variation from shocks to shelter availability from Los Angeles County's winter shelters program to study the effects of providing temporary shelter. We find that reducing unsheltered homelessness significantly reduces crime and ER visits for psychiatric conditions. We conclude with evidence that entering shelter also reduces short-run mortality but find no evidence that temporary shelter reduces future homelessness more than street outreach or other non-shelter services. Our findings suggest that shelter functions as a public good with high social benefits. When agents charged with provision of homeless services are evaluated on their ability to reduce overall homelessness, they are unlikely to internalize these benefits and may under provide shelter.</content>

    <title>Productivity Catch-Up or Factor Shift in the Race for Global Industrial Dominance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine global trends in productivity and sectoral dominance across countries and industries, asking whether changes are driven by productivity catch-up or shifts in factor endowments. To address this, we develop a general-equilibrium, multi-country, multi-sector model with a global production network based on international input--output linkages. The model incorporates country-specific technologies, factor endowments (skilled and unskilled labor and capital), and tariffs. Calibrating the model to international data from 1996 to 2007, we find that in high-income countries productivity changes are mainly driven by technology, while in middle-income countries capital is most crucial. We then assess whether these changes explain structural transformation in global output shares. For most industries where one group of countries overtakes another, the primary cause is the change in capital and skilled labor, rather than factor-induced productivity improvements. Overall, factor endowment shifts play the central role in explaining changes in sectoral dominance across countries and industries.</content>

    <title>Beyond Education and Occupation: Unpacking the Large Gender Wage Gap in Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender wage gaps persist globally, particularly in poor countries. Using Kenya Life Panel Survey data, we first document a raw gender wage gap of 79 log points (55%). We show it remains large, at 39 log points (32%), even controlling for a novel set of individual characteristics – cognitive performance, personality traits, economic preferences, and job tasks – in addition to standard covariates. These novel factors account for only 20% of the residual gap unexplained by education and occupation. Though most Kenyans report egalitarian gender views, these patterns suggest that barriers still hinder women’s labor outcomes.</content>

    <title>Diffusing Innovations Under Market Competition: Evidence from Drug-Eluting Stents</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how hospital competition and insurance reimbursement policy shape the diffusion of medical innovations. Using patient-level data from Taiwan's drug-eluting stent (DES) market in the Taipei metropolitan area, we estimate a structural model of hospital behavior, incorporating patient demand and hospitals' endogenous portfolio and pricing decisions. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: intense competition lowers prices but weakens hospitals' incentives to adopt new technologies, with total welfare peaking at an intermediate level of concentration. We then evaluate policy solutions. Selective contracting—where the government insurer negotiates exclusive wholesale discounts—can achieve a ``quadruple-win'' for consumers, hospitals, participating manufacturers, and the payer. In contrast, increasing the insurer's DES-specific reimbursement encourages hospitals to expand DES technology adoption and lower patient payment per DES, but creates a substantial fiscal burden for the insurer. Alternatively, a patient coupon program targeting low-income patients improves equity but has limited market-wide impact, as hospitals barely modify their price or portfolio decisions in response. These findings highlight that effective technology diffusion policies must account for downstream hospitals' strategic responses and their market competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are state-imposed behavioral remedies effective substitutes for federal antitrust enforcement? We evaluate state regulation of hospital mergers under Certificates of Public Advantage (COPAs). Using hospital data from 1996-2022, we compare COPA-regulated mergers to unregulated mergers with similar anticompetitive potential. In highly concentrated markets, COPA mergers result in 11.1 p.p. lower price growth but 0.5 p.p. greater increases in 30-day mortality rates. We find a negative correlation between price and mortality effects for COPA mergers, consistent with theoretical predictions that binding price caps exacerbate quality deterioration. Our findings suggest that COPA contracts are poor substitutes for traditional antitrust enforcement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does ethnic identification vary with education among disadvantaged minorities? We study this question for Roma people, Europe's largest ethnic minority, using linked Romanian census data and birth records. We measure how individuals change reported ethnicity over time, or “pass.” Roma identification strongly declines with education, from 80% for those with no education to 40% for postsecondary graduates. We estimate a model with persistent individual heterogeneity and find 3-6 times more Roma postsecondary graduates than in official data. Survey data we collect shows that most Romanians are unaware of these patterns. Such selective passing may reinforce stereotypes about marginalized groups.</content>

    <title>Exposure to Science and Scientific Careers: Evidence from Minimum Wage Increases and University Lab Employment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how exposure to scientific research in university laboratories influences students’ pursuit of careers in science. Using administrative data from thousands of research labs linked to student career outcomes and a difference-in-differences design, we show that state minimum wage increases reduce employment of undergraduate research assistants in labs by 7.4%. Undergraduates exposed to these minimum wage increases graduate with 18.1% fewer quarters of lab experience. Using minimum wage changes as an instrumental variable, we estimate that one fewer quarter working in a lab, particularly early in college, reduces the probability of working in the life sciences industry by 2 percentage points and of pursuing doctoral education by 7 percentage points. These effects are attenuated for students supported by the Federal Work-Study program. Our findings highlight how labor market policies can shape the career paths of future scientists and the importance of budget flexibility for principal investigators providing undergraduates with research experience.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how Elon Musk's polarizing and partisan actions have impacted Tesla vehicle sales in the United States. Using county-level, monthly data on new vehicle registrations, we leverage how changes in vehicle sales over time diverge across counties with differing shares of Democratic and Republican voters. Without the Musk partisan effect, Tesla sales between October 2022 and April 2025 would have been 67-83% higher, equivalent to 1-1.26 million more vehicles. Musk’s partisan activities also increased the sales of other automakers' electric and hybrid vehicles 17-22% because of substitution, and undermined California’s progress in meeting its zero-emissions vehicle target.</content>

    <title>The Cook County Tax on Sweetened Beverages: The Impact on Purchases of its Announcement, Implementation, and Repeal</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taxes on sweetened beverages have been widely adopted in response to increases in diet-related chronic disease.  An episode of particular interest occurred in Cook County, Illinois, where a beverage tax was announced, implemented, and then repealed. This paper is the first to estimate the effects of this tax using household-level data on purchases. We estimate difference-in-differences models that compare the change in beverage purchases over time in Cook County to that in comparison areas. The results indicate that consumer purchases did not detectably respond to the announcement of the tax. Implementation of the tax reduced purchases by 22.5% for all taxed beverages, 16.5% for high-calorie taxed beverages and a 33% for low-calorie (e.g. diet) taxed beverages. This implies a price elasticity of demand of -0.66 for all taxed beverages, -0.48 for high-calorie taxed beverages and -0.97 for low-calorie taxed beverages. The impact of the tax did not vary by household income, and there is no detectable impact of the tax on purchases of possible substitutes (bottled water, fruit juice, milk). After repeal of the tax, purchases of taxed beverages returned to their baseline quantities; there was no evidence of habit formation.</content>

    <title>Lessons for Automatic Fiscal Stabilizers from the Great Recession and the COVID Recession</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper simulates economic developments as if the discretionary fiscal stimulus enacted in the past two recessions had not occurred and additional automatic fiscal stabilizers had been deployed instead. For the calibration of key economic relationships most consistent with the empirical literature, we find that more sustained fiscal stimulus would have pushed unemployment down more rapidly following the Great Recession and that more limited stimulus would have caused inflation to increase much less following the COVID recession. We caution, though, that our estimates are uncertain given the large number of assumptions embedded in the calculations. Under different assumptions about the supply side of the economy when resource utilization is high, the stimulus enacted in early 2021 was not a significant cause of the observed runup in inflation that followed, and substituting an automatic stabilizer would have made little difference to inflation.</content>

    <title>Managing Financial Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we revisit the question of how to manage financial crises using the framework proposed by Bianchi and Mendoza (2018). We show that this model economy exhibits a multiplicity of constrained-efficient equilibria, which arises because the private shadow value of collateral influences the forward-looking asset price. Among these equilibria, the specific one studied in Bianchi and Mendoza (2018) can be implemented using a tax/subsidy on debt alone. In that case, both the ex ante tax and ex post subsidy are quantitatively important for welfare under the optimal time-consistent policy. Limiting either component can lead to a welfare loss relative to the unregulated competitive equilibrium, highlighting the complementarity between crisis prevention and crisis resolution tools. We also show that, under certain conditions, all Pareto-dominant constrained-efficient equilibria entail the unconstrained allocation chosen by a social planner subject to the country budget constraint, and this allocation can be implemented with purely ex post policies.</content>

    <title>Interpreting Turbulent Episodes in International Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the anatomy of the international portfolio finance network. As global financial linkages have become denser over time, cross-border portfolio equity positions have grown in importance relative to debt for Emerging markets and Advanced economies. Using the framework developed by Stavrakeva and Rey (2024), we construct a novel proxy of daily foreign investor holdings in both equity and long-term sovereign debt markets across 32 currency areas. Leveraging an instrumental variable strategy, we identify an effect of foreign equity ETF inflows on exchange rates and local stock market prices. Our high-frequency proxy enables us to interpret episodes of turbulence in international finance. It should prove useful to assess how persistent the current shocks to the international financial system are likely to be.</content>

    <title>Trade Policy Ambiguity</title>

      <name>Joseph B. Steinberg</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how Knightian uncertainty about the distribution of future trade policies affects current trade flows using a dynamic trade model with a sunk cost of exporting. Qualitatively, trade-policy ambiguity reduces export participation in a similar manner to standard trade-policy risk, but also increases sensitivity to tariff bounds, decreases sensitivity to the likelihood of a tariff increase, and can either increase or decrease sensitivity to tariff persistence. Quantitatively, ambiguity dampens the response of trade to persistent reforms and strengthens the response to transitory reforms.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies of intergenerational mobility have begun to expand outside of the traditional outcomes such as income, education and occupation, into using alternative measures of wellbeing. In this chapter we survey the evidence on studies of these alternative measures with a focus on health, consumption and life satisfaction. We also incorporate lessons from the income mobility literature that may be relevant for how we think about these alternative measures both conceptually and empirically. We highlight a few approaches that researchers can consider to incorporate alternative measures and we conclude that a widening of our conception of  intergenerational mobility to incorporate measures of wellbeing may identify shortfalls in some of our current approaches.</content>

    <title>Carbon Taxation and Firm Behavior in Emerging Economies: Evidence from South Africa</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first comprehensive evidence on how firms in emerging economies respond to carbon taxation. Using detailed administrative data, we study the announcement and implementation of South Africa’s 2019 carbon tax—a potential trailblazer for other developing countries with limited state capacity amid the global expansion of carbon pricing. Contrary to concerns that carbon taxes might hinder growth or employment, we find no negative effects on firm performance or jobs. Firms facing higher effective tax rates increased activity following the tax’s announcement, four years before implementation, likely reflecting the resolution of regulatory uncertainty and efforts to mitigate stranded asset costs. While we find no measurable reduction in emissions—likely due to this anticipatory behavior—our results suggest that carbon taxation can be implemented without harming economic outcomes, even in the short term and in low- and middle-income settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the careers of minimum wage workers by merging SIPP panels covering 1992-2016 into the LEHD. A long-run analysis shows strong earnings growth for these workers in subsequent decades, becoming indistinguishable from peers earning modestly more initially. Most of this growth is due to the steep earnings trajectories of young workers. Older workers earning minimum wages show a modest dip in earnings at that moment compared to earlier and later periods. Increases in state minimum wages do not significantly alter the future careers of workers who are on the minimum wage when the increases occur.</content>

    <title>Monetary Policy and Housing Overvaluation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how housing market overvaluation—measured by the price-to-rent ratio and its deviations from long-term trends—affects the transmission of monetary policy. Using U.S. metropolitan-level data and three measures of monetary policy shocks, we find that house prices respond more strongly to policy rate changes in overvalued markets. Examining buyer heterogeneity, we show that investor demand, proxied by non-owner-occupied purchases, declines more sharply after monetary tightening in these markets. These results are consistent with models of extrapolative beliefs and suggest that monetary policy can serve a stabilizing role during housing booms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Certificate of Need (CON) laws regulate entry and capital investments in healthcare with the goal of containing costs while preserving access and quality. This paper examines the relationship between these laws and overall mortality as well as leading causes of mortality: cancer and cardiovascular disease. Using county-level death records, we conducted an event-study analysis comparing mortality rates in states that repealed their CON laws to states that did not between 1979 and 2004. The repeal of CON laws was associated with short-run reductions in cancer mortality, primarily from reductions in lung cancer mortality. Cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality rates were unchanged.</content>

    <title>Strategic Avoidance and the Welfare Impacts of U.S. Solar Panel Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the effects of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imported solar panels. We first provide clear evidence that tariff-exposed firms shifted production to locations that did not face tariffs, and that domestic prices increased relative to other markets. We then develop a structural model to analyze welfare effects. We find that the tariffs generated modest gains for domestic manufacturers and for government revenues, but larger losses in domestic consumer surplus and environmental benefits, thereby reducing domestic welfare. Furthermore, the tariffs reduced domestic solar industry employment and wages. By contrast, subsidizing solar panel manufacturing could increase domestic production, employment, and welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a randomized controlled trial to examine how the costs of contraception affect method choice, pregnancy, abortion, and childbirth among U.S. women. The study recruited women seeking care through Title X—a national family planning program subsidizing reproductive health services for low-income Americans—and randomized vouchers making the full spectrum of available contraception highly discounted or free. We find that subsidizing contraception has large and persistent effects on the choice of contraceptive method, resulting in significantly fewer pregnancies and abortions within two years. Subsidizing contraception negatively affected births, but the effect was not significant at two years.</content>

    <title>Stimulus through Insurance: the Marginal Propensity to Repay Debt</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using detailed microdata, we document that households often use “stimulus” checks to pay down debt, especially those with low net wealth-to-income ratios. To rationalize these patterns, we introduce an empirically plausible borrowing price schedule into an otherwise standard incomplete markets model. Because interest rates rise with debt, borrowers have increasingly larger incentives to use an additional dollar to reduce debt service payments rather than consume. Using our calibrated model, we then study whether and how this marginal propensity to repay debt (MPRD) alters the aggregate implications of fiscal transfers. We uncover a trade-off between stimulus and insurance, as high–debt individuals gain considerably from transfers, but consume relatively little immediately. This mechanism lowers the immediate stimulus effect of fiscal transfers, but sustains aggregate consumption for longer.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We enrich a standard debt overhang model with liquidity constraints to guide the design and interpretation of a collateralized debt modification experiment on a publicly traded lender’s delinquent vehicle loans to minibus entrepreneurs. Liquidity constraints add another borrower incentive compatibility constraint that interacts with debt overhang to shape repayment and effort. Consistent with model predictions, we find: debt reduction does not affect liquidity constrained borrowers; payment reduction improves both repayment and effort for borrowers with sufficient vehicle equity; payment reduction induces repayment without effort increases for low-equity borrowers. These results suggest a pecking order strategy for modification practice and policy.</content>

    <title>Biased Party Nominations as a Source of Women's Electoral Underperformance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What accounts for differences in electoral success between male and female candidates? We argue that parties systematically nominate female candidates to districts where the party is less popular, making it harder for women to get elected. Our empirical strategy uses the German mixed electoral system to create counterfactual gender vote gaps. These gaps represent the scenario where male and female candidates are nominated in districts where their respective parties have equal popularity. Using data on all candidates for the German Bundestag across eleven elections, we document that female underperformance, and its variation across parties and election years, is explained almost entirely by women running in districts where their party is less popular. In contrast, we find no evidence that voter bias or candidate characteristics play a substantial role. Our argument highlights gendered party gatekeeping that increases in district strength as an important driver of female underrepresentation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that procyclical stocks–those whose cash flows rise with expected economic growth–earn higher average returns than countercyclical stocks. Leveraging nearly 75 years of economist survey data on real GDP growth expectations, we identify economic states while sidestepping model-driven forecast error. GDP forecasts comove with consumption and predict the market return, real GDP growth, and consumption growth. This approach builds on the literatures on both the Intertemporal and Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Models. We document a statistically significant, economically meaningful procyclicality premium that remains robust to standard factor controls.</content>

    <title>The Austerity Threshold</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new indicator of fiscal capacity—the “austerity threshold”: the debt-to-GDP level above which the government must raise fiscal surpluses to ensure debt safety. In a model with realistic risk premia, nominal rigidities, and an intermediary sector, calibrated to the U.S., we estimate this threshold at 189%. We highlight the roles of safety premia and intermediation-driven convenience yields. The threshold varies with the source of surpluses: spending cuts reduce inflation and allow low interest rates, while tax increases distort labor supply and raise inflation. Uncertainty over the austerity regime—spending cuts or tax increases—sharply lowers fiscal capacity. The expected austerity regime affects asset prices and macro outcomes even when debt-to-GDP is well below the threshold.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new LLM-based survey framework that enables retrospective coverage, economic reasoning, dynamic effects, and clean identification. We recover human-comparable treatment effects in a multi-wave randomized controlled trial of inflation expectations surveys, at 1/1000 the cost. To demonstrate the framework’s full potential, we extend the benchmark human survey (10 waves, 2018–2023) to over 50 waves dating back to 1990. We further examine the economic mechanisms underlying agents’ expectation formation, identifying the mean-reversion and individual-attention channels. Finally, we trace dynamic treatment effects and demonstrate clean identification. Together, these innovations demonstrate that LLM surveys enable research designs unattainable with human surveys.</content>

    <title>Cannabis and Respiratory Health</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cannabis legalization has increased substantially in the past two decades with state-level policies that permit possession this product. A potential concern with cannabis legalization and the corresponding increase in consumption is that – because smoking is the most common consumption mode – respiratory health could worsen. In this study, we offer new evidence on the impact of recreational cannabis laws on asthma outcomes. To do so, we combine commercial health insurance claims and survey data over the period 2008 to 2022 with difference-in-differences and event-study methods. Our findings suggest that asthma diagnoses do not change following legalization of recreational cannabis, while asthma-related dispensed prescription medications decline, and asthma-related outpatient visits and inpatient hospitalizations are stable. An analysis of changes in use of smoked and non-smoked cannabis post-law suggests that, on net, the increase in overall cannabis use attributable to legalization is driven by use of non-smoked cannabis, which may explain why we find limited evidence that asthma outcomes worsen post-law. Collectively, these results suggest that expanded access to legal cannabis has not worsened respiratory health overall, and hint that some patients may use cannabis to manage asthma symptoms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the causal impact of being denied benefit access on the financial well-being of marginally-excluded households. Using experimental and quasi-random variation in the flexibility of mandatory intake interviews and a unique linkage between administrative Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and credit report data, we find that households screened out of SNAP due to administrative barriers suffer tangible downstream economic consequences. Specifically, we find that process-related denials increase debt and delinquencies, and decrease credit scores. These results highlight the economic importance of implementation design and its role in strengthening (or undermining) the financial protection provided by social insurance programs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The longstanding debate over whether human capabilities and skills are shaped more by “nature” or “nurture” has been revitalized by recent advances in genetics, particularly in the use of polygenic scores (PGSs) to proxy for genetic endowments. Yet, we argue that PGSs embed not only direct genetic effects but also indirect environmental influences, raising questions about their validity for causal analysis. We show that these conflated measures can mislead studies of gene–environment interactions, especially when parental behavior responds to children’s genetic risk. To address this issue, we construct a new latent measure of genetic risk that integrates individual genotypes with diagnostic symptoms, using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health linked to restricted individual SNP-level genotypes from dbGaP. Exploiting multiple sources of variation—including the Mendelian within-family genetic randomization among siblings—we find consistent evidence that parents compensate by investing more in children with higher genetic risk for ADHD. Strikingly, these compensatory responses disappear when genetic risk is proxied by the conventional ADHD PGS, which also yields weaker—and in some cases reversed—predictions for long-run outcomes. Finally, we embed our latent measure of genetic endowments into a standard dynamic structural model of child development. The model shows that both parental investments and latent genetic risk jointly shape children’s cognitive and mental health development, underscoring the importance of modeling the dynamic interplay between genes and environments in the formation of human capital.</content>

    <title>The Role of Private Debt in the Financial Ecosystem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to private debt, examines the key drivers behind its expansion, and frames the discussion around potential risk accumulation in the broader economy. Overall, the development of private debt can be viewed as the emergence of a new technology that facilitated the expansion of the high-yield corporate debt market into the middle market. Throughout its history, the evolution of the high-yield debt and the rise of private debt have been closely intertwined with the growth of private equity. Historically, banks have not had significant exposure to financing buyouts or other highly leveraged transactions, whether in the large-cap or mid-cap segments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine disparities in judicial outcomes among people charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), a setting in which legal guilt is objectively determined by breath alcohol content (BrAC). Focusing on first-time offenders with no aggravating circumstances and BrAC above the legal threshold, we find that race, gender, and financial resources strongly predict the likelihood of incarceration and case dismissal. Defendants with greater socioeconomic advantage are more likely to access rehabilitative alternatives and avoid criminal records. We discuss how these outcome differences may reflect not only disparities in options offered by the court, but also in defendants’ choices among them.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most nations in the world have side-by-side private and public health care systems. Policymakers worry that “dual practice” across sectors might reduce care to the public sector. This concern led regions in Spain to offer “exclusivity bonuses” to physicians who practice exclusively in the public sector. We show theoretically that the impact of these bonuses on the public sector is ambiguous. We demonstrate empirically that the bonuses backfired: they did increase exclusive participation in the public sector, but significantly reduced hours of work. When regions added offsetting bonuses for dual practice, they were largely ineffective.</content>

    <title>The Price of Intelligence: How Should Socially-minded Firms Price and Deploy AI?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leading AI firms claim to prioritize social welfare. How should firms with a social mandate price and deploy AI? We derive pricing formulas that depart from profit maximization by incorporating incentives to improve welfare and reduce labor disruptions. Using US data, we evaluate several scenarios. A welfarist firm that values both profit and welfare should price closer to marginal cost, as efficiency gains outweigh distributional concerns. A conservative firm focused on labor-market stability should price above the profit-maximizing level in the short run, especially when its AI may displace low-income workers. Overall, socially minded firms face a trade-off between expanding access to AI and the resulting loss in profits and labor market risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter explores the long-run implications of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for economic growth and labor markets. AGI makes it feasible to perform all economically valuable work using compute. I distinguish between bottleneck and supplementary work—tasks that are essential versus non-essential for unhindered growth. As computational resources expand: (i) the economy automates all bottleneck work, (ii) some supplementary work may be left exclusively to humans, (iii) output becomes linear in compute and labor and its growth is driven by the expansion of compute, (iv) wages converge to the opportunity cost of computational resources required to reproduce human work, and (v) the share of labor income in GDP converges to zero.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Commercial banking is an industry in which long-term, nonexclusive relationships between bankers and their borrowers are governed by short-term contracts. This paper documents the nature of bank-borrower relationships in a historical setting. We use a new dataset of 55,000 loans to 10,000 unique borrowers over 35 years in the mid-nineteenth century. Two-way fixed effects models reveal that a one standard deviation increase in the number of previous loans leads to an increase in loan size by 4.72%. A one-year increase in the duration of a relationship leads to an increase in loan size of 5.6%. Relationships have small effects on loan rates, but substantial effects on collateral. Borrowers with relationships with competing banks receive substantially smaller loans. Propensity score matching reveals that banks learn about borrowers early in the relationship. Finally, the bank severed relationships with about half of the borrowers who defaulted on a loan. A surviving relationship becomes more valuable after default.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the health consequences of redistributing political power through the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act, which eliminated barriers to voting for previously disenfranchised nonwhite populations. The intervention led to broad declines in under-five mortality but sharply contrasting effects in other age groups: mortality fell among non-white children, younger adults, and older women, yet rose among whites and older non-white men. These differences cannot be reconciled by changes in population composition or material conditions. Instead, we present evidence suggesting psychosocial stress and retaliatory responses arising from perceived status threat as key mechanisms.</content>

    <title>Voting with Their Feet: Democratic Backsliding and Market-Minded Migration - Evidence from Israel and Europe</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comparative framework, the study examines how variations in political regimes across Israel and Europe shape patterns of international migration. In both contexts, episodes of democratic backsliding serve as quasi-exogenous shocks that reveal the causal link between institutional erosion and outward mobility.
In Israel, the origin of democratic backsliding lies in a corruption shock—the criminal indictment of the prime minister—which escalated into an executive–judicial shock as the government launched an anti-democratic judicial overhaul. This confrontation between the executive and judiciary provides a natural experiment for identifying how institutional breakdowns shape migration decisions.
In Europe, the origin of democratic backsliding stems from a “Syrian shock”—a massive refugee inflow that strained administrative capacity, polarized politics, and weakened liberal institutions. The resulting governance erosion triggered emigration responses structurally like those observed in Israel.
Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation, the study identifies causal effects of democratic erosion on migration flows. Across both settings, out-migration emerges as a market-minded response to illiberal regime change—a behavioral signal of sensitivity to policies that features nationalizing industries, restrict free speech, and undermine the rule of law. Together, the Israeli and European experiences demonstrate that illiberal governance functions as a systemic push factor for emigration, beyond standard economic explanations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Air transportation supports economic growth and global connectivity but imposes localized environmental costs, particularly through aircraft noise. We estimate the causal effect of aviation noise on housing prices using quasi-experimental variation from the Federal Aviation Administration's rollout of performance-based navigation (PBN) procedures and runway reconfigurations at three major U.S. airports. Combining high-resolution flight trajectory data with geocoded housing transactions, we apply a difference-in-differences hedonic framework to identify changes in exposure unanticipated by residents. A one-decibel increase in annual day-night average sound level reduces house prices by 0.6 to 1.0 percent. Among alternative noise metrics, average exposure explains property value impacts most strongly. Willingness to pay for quieter conditions varies systematically with income and race, indicating that aircraft noise externalities have meaningful distributional consequences. Our results highlight the need to incorporate localized environmental costs into aviation and urban land-use policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do political campaigns so often yield unexpected results? We address this question by separately estimating the direct effect of a campaign on targeted voters and the indirect effect on others in the same social environment. Partnering with a local NGO during Argentina’s 2023 presidential election, we randomized the distribution of leaflets providing an expert assessment of the likely consequences of certain proposals by the outsider candidate Javier Milei. Exploiting Argentina’s unique sub-precinct election reporting system, we show that the campaign reduced Milei’s support among directly treated voters, as expected, but increased his support among untreated voters in treated precincts, producing a backfiring, net-positive effect for Milei. A pre-registered replication confirmed these opposite-signed effects. Using theory and a survey experiment, we show that the minority of voters who disbelieved the campaign were more motivated to discuss it with peers, convincing them to support Milei. This mobilization effect appears especially likely when campaigns criticize outsider candidates. Our results highlight how campaigns aimed at anti-elite candidates can unintentionally mobilize support for them.</content>

    <title>The GATT vs Inflation: Tokyo Drift</title>
    <updated>2025-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Andrew Greenland, James Lake &amp; John Lopresti</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper demonstrates that ignoring the source of variation in tariff levels yields misleading conclusions regarding the effects of tariff changes. Specifically, we show that changes in the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) tariff are insufficient to quantify the magnitude or sign of the effect of tariff changes on economic outcomes. To illustrate this point, we construct the first database of annual US statutory tariffs from 1972 to 1988 and use it to explore the consequences of liberalization in the years spanning the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Decomposing the aggregate AVE into its statutory and endogenous components, we document two distinct liberalizations in our sample. Prior to 1979, inflation combines with specific tariffs to create an “accidental liberalization”, despite the absence of widespread statutory tariff changes. After 1979, endogenous changes in the composition of imports mask the large Tokyo Round statutory tariff liberalization. Generalizing an exact hat framework to accommodate specific tariffs, we show that inflation-driven reductions in AVEs account for roughly half of the tariff liberalization in our sample, but these changes ultimately reduce imports and welfare. Finally, we show that specific tariffs remain an important determinant of cross-sectional variation in AVEs: between 2000 and 2017, one-third to one-half of the annual cross-sectional variance in good-level AVEs is driven by variation in the AVE of specific tariffs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The 911 system, a vital component of public safety, responds to over 210 million emergency calls each year. We examine the effect of small exogenous public health stressors – pollen emissions – on the operation of the 911 call system in Seattle, Washington. Leveraging daily variation in pollen levels, we evaluate pollen’s impact on the volume of 911 calls. We find that a 100% increase in pollen levels – the modal day-over-day variation we observe in our data – results in six additional 911 calls per day. We further show that elevated pollen levels influence the quality of emergency and non-emergency response. The 911 system responds to increased strain by prioritizing more urgent calls – and as a result, increasing response time to non-urgent calls. Though all calls are connected to a dispatcher, there are increased missed connections – canceled emergency response, missing records of response, and false reports. Despite the prioritization of urgent calls, these additional daily calls lead to reallocation of resources in ways that potentially impede service quality. Thus, our findings suggest that common and small shocks may lead to under-provision of valuable services to communities across the U.S.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We ask to what extent the quantification of labor market power depends on the modeling of the long-term worker-firm employment relationship. We develop an oligopsony model with dynamic wage contracts. Workers decide whether and where to work, choosing among firms providing different amenities and solving a dynamic discrete choice labor supply problem with firm-specific human capital. As a result, firms optimally choose wage-tenure contracts to attract and retain workers. We find that such contracts mitigate firms' incentives to impose large instantaneous wage markdowns—compared to standard static wage-setting models—thereby reducing the share of socially inefficient worker-firm separations. As a consequence, we show that the empirical approaches based on "sufficient statistics" tend to overestimate the extent of labor market power: low levels of firm-specific labor supply elasticities do not necessarily indicate rent extraction, but instead reflect firms’ ability to retain workers by offering long-term value through human capital accumulation.</content>

    <title>Environmental Catastrophe and the Direction of Invention: Evidence from the American Dust Bowl</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how innovation responded to and shaped the economic impact of the American Dust Bowl, an environmental catastrophe that led to widespread soil erosion on the US Plains during the 1930s. Combining data on county-level erosion, the historical geography of crop production, and crop-specific innovation, I document that in the wake of the environmental crisis, agricultural technology development was strongly and persistently re-directed toward more Dust Bowl-exposed crops and, within crops, toward bio-chemical and planting technologies that could directly mitigate economic losses from environmental distress. County-level exposure to Dust Bowl-induced innovation significantly dampened the effect of land erosion on agricultural land values and revenue. These results highlight the role of crises in spurring innovation and the importance of endogenous technological progress as an adaptive force in the face of disasters.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the cost-effectiveness of targeted payroll taxes for stimulating labor demand. It uses rich administrative data to study the effects of an Italian reform that raised social security contributions for apprenticeship contracts but granted a substantial discount for firms with 9 employees or less. The discount does not increase demand for apprenticeship contracts. Instead, it subsidizes inframarginal hiring. This reform is not cost-effective. Point estimates imply that each million euros of foregone social security contributions supports the employment of 29 apprentices for one year and no permanent contracts (these estimates are not statistically different from zero).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policymakers often cite the risk that inflation expectations might “de-anchor” as a key reason for responding forcefully to inflationary shocks. We develop a model to analyze this trade-off and to quantify the benefits of stable long-run inflation expectations. In our framework, households and firms are imperfectly informed about the central bank’s objective and learn from its policy choices. Recognizing this interaction, the central bank raises interest rates more aggressively after adverse supply shocks and accepts short-run output costs to secure more stable inflation expectations. The strength of this reputation channel depends on how sensitive long-run inflation expectations are to surprises in interest rates. Using high-frequency identification, we estimate these elasticities for emerging and advanced economies and find large negative values for Brazil. We fit our model to these findings and use it to quantify how reputation building motives affect monetary policy decisions, and the role of central bank's credibility in promoting macroeconomic stability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How rational is the stock market and how efficiently does it process information? We use machine learning to establish a practical measure of rational and efficient expectation formation while identifying distortions and inefficiencies in the subjective beliefs of market participants. The algorithm independently learns, stays attentive to fundamentals, credit risk, and sentiment, and makes abrupt course-corrections at critical junctures. By contrast, the subjective beliefs of investors, professionals, and equity analysts do little of this and instead contain predictable mistakes–prestakes–that are especially prevalent in times of market turbulence. Trading schemes that bet against prestakes deliver defensive strategies with large CAPM and Fama-French 5-factor alphas.</content>

    <title>An Inverse-Ramsey Tax Rule</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional optimal commodity tax analysis, dating back to Ramsey (1927), prescribes that to maximize welfare one should impose higher taxes on goods with lower demand elasticities. Yet policy makers do not stress minimizing efficiency costs as a desideratum. In this note we revisit the commodity tax problem, and show that the attractiveness of the Ramsey inverse-elasticity prescription can itself be inverted if the tax system is chosen – or at least strongly influenced – by taxpayers who are overly confident of their ability, relative to others, to substitute away from taxed goods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dual-regime business tax systems typically subject smaller firms to an output (turnover) tax and larger firms to a profit (corporate) tax. Despite their prevalence, there is little formal analysis of their optimal design. This paper addresses this gap by developing a theoretical framework to analyze the optimal tax parameters and the relative performance of two types of dual-regime systems: threshold and minimum tax systems. We show that either type of dual regime system can yield lower social costs than a single regime system. Using parameter values from recent empirical studies, we also show that a generalized minimum tax system we propose would outperform other dual regime systems under most parameter values. These findings carry important policy implications, particularly as many countries currently employ either threshold or minimum tax systems, but none have yet implemented a generalized minimum tax.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial misconduct is often a team activity, facilitated by face-to-face interactions, shared norms, and trust. We exploit the sudden shift to remote work during COVID-19 to examine how workplace organization shapes collusion and financial misconduct. Using a novel firm-level measure of work-from-home feasibility, we find that firms that are more able to operate remotely experienced large post-2020 declines in misconduct. This decline is found across multiple misreporting proxies and is robust to various alternative measures of remote work. Cross-sectional tests indicate stronger declines in teamwork-intensive firms, firms with effective internal controls, and firms with weaker pre-COVID employee perceptions of culture and leadership. Overall, our findings reflect that financial misconduct is a team activity, sensitive to the organizational structure of the firm, with important implications for governance and organizational design.</content>

    <title>The International Monetary System in the Last and Next 20 Years Redux</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a paper 20 years ago, we analyzed the evolution of the international monetary system over the preceding 20 years and projected its evolution 20 years into the future, on the assumption of unchanged transition probabilities.  Here we compare those projections with outcomes and provide new projections, again 20 years into the future.  Although the world as a whole has seen financial opening and movement away from intermediate exchange rate regimes, as projected, movement has been slower than projected on the basis of observed transition probabilities in the 20 years preceding our forecast.  New projections again based on unchanged transition probabilities but allowing countries to shift between advanced, emerging and developing country groupings and reclassifying exchange rate regimes to accord with current practice again suggest that policy regimes will be modestly different in 2045 than today.  There will be a continued decline in intermediate exchange rate arrangements, and gains for hard pegs, as emerging markets move in this direction, and for more freely floating rates, driven by developing countries.  There will be a further increase in the share of countries with open capital accounts, driven by emerging markets and developing countries.</content>

    <title>Ideology in Government: Evidence from the Office of Indian Affairs and the Assimilation Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the ideology of government officials and coercive policymaking by examining the Office of Indian Affairs, an institution that held broad authority over the land, education, and legal governance of Indigenous populations in the United States. We digitize the detailed reports of the agency's bureaucrats and use computational tools to measure the strength of their support for assimilationist policies during the 19th and early 20th centuries. We document major shifts in ideological commitments that coincide with the entry—and eventual exit—of social reformers nominated for high-level agency positions by religious organizations. We find that ideology within the bureaucracy appears to moderate around the turn of the century despite the organization's overall continued pursuit of major assimilation policies, such as the promotion of farming and enrollment in off-reservation Indian boarding schools. To examine performance implications of ideology within the bureaucracy, we conclude with an analysis of policy implementation after the passage of the Dawes Act, a landmark law that aimed to dismantle collective land holdings. We provide evidence showing that the agencies with local staff who express greater past commitment to assimilationist goals carried out more land redistribution immediately after Dawes became law.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As increasingly frequent extreme weather events disrupt lives, institutions are turning to early-warning systems and advance preparation to accelerate aid delivery. We present evidence from a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh and Nepal testing whether providing cash within days of a flood leads to greater benefits than delivering the same assistance months later—or if it simply shifts the timing of benefits without improving overall welfare. Results suggest that timely cash assistance leads to overall gains in food security and psychosocial well-being. This evidence supports efforts to forecast crises and release disaster relief quickly.</content>
