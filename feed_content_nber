    <title>Substituting Talent with Transactions: Acquisitions as Responses to Immigration Restrictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms respond to talent scarcity caused by restrictive immigration policies. We argue that when firms cannot build capabilities internally through hiring, they alter their boundaries by engaging in corporate acquisitions to make up for the foregone talent and capabilities. Using data on 3,861 U.S. firms and their use of the H-1B visa program (2001-2020), we leverage two exogenous shocks—the 2004 H-1B cap reduction and the 2007-2008 visa lottery—and find causal evidence that firms make more acquisitions as their exposure to immigration restrictions rises. This effect is stronger for deals with purposes related to the skills of the foregone talent, for small acquisitions, for domestic targets, and for targets in places with higher concentrations of skilled workers.</content>

    <title>Utilitarian or Quantile-Welfare Evaluation of Health Policy?</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Charles F. Manski &amp; John Mullahy</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an alternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and studied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision making under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility. That paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of quantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a cardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual decision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic theoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related specifically to health policy. We then propose a procedure to nonparametrically bound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice time-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health economists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning measurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.</content>

    <title>Segregation, Spillovers, and the Locus of Racial Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a discrete choice framework to provide the first nesting of Thomas C. Schelling’s canonical models of racial segregation amenable to empirical examination. Using U.S. Census data from 1970–2000, we demonstrate a central role for spatial racial spillovers in shaping racial clustering, patterns of racial shares and housing prices at the boundary of racial clusters, and the locus of racial change. Our results on the locus of racial change conflict strongly with prominent prior results on racial tipping. Our theory provides a foundation for spatially stratified regressions. The strongest spatial effects in the prior work are not tipping, but the distinct biased White suburbanization. Tipping effects in urban areas remote from Minority clusters are small or insignificant. In urban areas proximate to Minority clusters they average less than half those reported in prior pooled results. Policies promoting racial integration must thus attend to the heterogeneous fragility of neighborhoods.</content>

    <title>How People Use ChatGPT</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.</content>

    <title>Insuring Labor Income Shocks: The Role of the Dynasty</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide empirical evidence on the importance of a relatively understudied channel of insurance against labor income shocks: transfers from (cash-rich) parents to (cash-short) children when the latter experience negative wage shocks. Matching population data for Norway across two generations, we establish several results. First, parents make a transfer—i.e., run down liquid assets—when adult children experience negative labor income shocks. Consistent with dynastic insurance, we observe no transfers when income shocks are positive. Second, parents' responses depend on the nature of the shock. If losses are temporary, parents dissave; if they are persistent, parents save in order to make future transfers. Parental transfers offset 43% of temporary and 27% of persistent losses. Third, insurance is lower when children have other smoothing options, like spousal labor supply, and is greater for shocks to their own child versus a child’s spouse. Support also increases if the spouse’s parents can contribute, suggesting “competition for attention.” Lastly, insurance flows are one-way: children do not insure their parents against income losses.</content>

    <title>Business Owners and the Self-Employed: Thirty-Three Million (and Counting!)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs are known to be key drivers of economic growth, and the rise of online platforms and the broader "gig economy" has led self-employment to surge in recent decades. Yet the young and small businesses associated with this activity are often absent from economic data. In this paper, we explore a novel longitudinal dataset that covers the owners of tens of millions of the smallest businesses: those without employees.  We produce three new sets of statistics on the rapidly growing set of nonemployer businesses.  First, we measure transitions between self-employment and wage and salary jobs. Second, we describe nonemployer business entry and exit, as well as transitions between legal form (e.g., sole proprietorship to S corporation). Finally, we link owners to their nonemployer businesses and examine the dynamics of business ownership.</content>

    <title>Human Capital and Racial Inequality in the US Labor Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;If racial gaps in measures of human capital like educational attainment and standardized test scores were eliminated, what would happen to racial disparities in wages, employment, and other labor market outcomes? A credible answer to this question is foundational for understanding the nature and scope of racial inequality and discrimination in the United States. This article reviews and synthesizes a literature that studies this question by estimating the extent to which controlling for measures of human capital changes Black-white gaps in labor market outcomes, and discusses various conceptual and methodological issues related to interpreting this type of exercise. I show that while accurately interpreting this exercise and its many variants requires careful thinking, the results elucidate many important and subtle aspects of racial inequality in the United States.</content>

    <title>Time for Mental Healthcare: Evidence from Paid Sick Leave Mandates</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of state paid sick leave (PSL) mandates on mental healthcare use. To do so, we use all-payer health insurance claims data from IQVIA 2015-2022 combined with difference-in-differences methods. Findings suggest that overall mental healthcare use does not change post-PSL mandate. The null finding overall masks clinically relevant changes along the intensive margin: patients substitute away from lower levels of care to higher levels of care as time constraints are relaxed. Further, analysis of survey data hints that this change in treatment use improves mental health. Keywords: Paid sick leave; social insurance; social insurance.</content>

    <title>Deep Learning for Solving Economic Models</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, is transforming research across many fields, including economics. Its impact is particularly strong in solving equilibrium economic models. These models often lack closed-form solutions, so economists have relied on numerical methods such as value function iteration, perturbation, and projection techniques. While powerful, these approaches face the curse of dimensionality, making global solutions computationally infeasible as the number of state variables increases. Recent advances in deep learning offer a new paradigm: flexible tools that efficiently approximate complex functions, manage high-dimensional problems, and expand the reach of quantitative economics. After introducing the basic concepts of deep learning, I illustrate the approach with the neoclassical growth model and discuss related ideas, including the double descent phenomenon and implicit regularization.</content>

    <title>More to Live for: Health Investment Responses to Expected Retirement Wealth in Chile</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important but poorly understood way that economic development may influence health is through the private incentives that it creates for individuals to invest in their own health.  In this paper, we study how individuals' forward-looking health investments respond to changes in expected future (but not current) wealth. Focusing on institutional features of Chile's public pension overhaul in 1981, we link administrative microdata to a detailed household panel survey, and we then exploit discrete breaks in the resulting cohort pension wealth profile using a fuzzy regression kink design (RKD). Although theoretically ambiguous, empirically we find that greater expected pension wealth increases the use of important preventive medical care (and to a lesser extent, promotes more costly healthy lifestyle behaviors) – leading to measurable increases in chronic disease diagnosis (a requisite for appropriate disease management), reductions in disease prevalence, and measurably lower mortality in old age (particularly due to chronic diseases). In general, these results provide new evidence that economic development can have a meaningful incentive effect on health.</content>

    <title>Abortion, Economic Hardship, and Crime</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how abortion access affects economic hardship and crime. Using a database of abortion provider locations and operations in Texas from 2009–2019, we exploit variation in travel distance to the nearest facility created by clinic closures following the enforcement of Texas HB-2 in 2013. We confirm previous evidence that increased distance to the nearest abortion facility reduces abortions and increases births. We provide novel evidence that reduced access to abortion also leads to significant economic hardship, reflected in lower labor force participation, rising debt, widening income inequality, and heightened housing insecurity. This financial strain translates into higher rates of financially motivated crime, such as theft and burglary, with no significant effect on violent crime. These effects extend beyond directly affected individuals, reflecting intrahousehold spillovers. These findings suggest far-reaching consequences of restricted access to reproductive healthcare.</content>

    <title>Do Markets Believe in Transformative AI?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic theory predicts that transformative technologies may influence interest rates by changing growth expectations, increasing uncertainty about growth, or raising concerns about existential risk.  Examining US bond yields around major AI model releases in 2023-4, we find economically large and statistically significant movements concentrated at longer maturities. The median and mean yield responses across releases in our sample are negative: long-term Treasury, TIPS, and corporate yields fall and remain lower for weeks.  Viewed through the lens of a simple, representative agent consumption-based asset pricing model, these declines correspond to downward revisions in expected consumption growth and/or a reduction in the perceived probability of extreme outcomes such as existential risk or arrival of a post-scarcity economy. By contrast, changes in consumption growth uncertainty do not appear to drive our results</content>

    <title>Inward and Outward Migration under Shifting Legal-Democratic Regimes</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Assaf Razin</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the two-way relationship between international migration and political regime change, highlighting a feedback loop in which political shifts shape migration flows, while migration itself reshapes political trajectories. Relying on a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework and a dataset combining migration flows, regime quality indicators (CHRI), and measures of international integration, we identify three central results.
First, substantial immigration into politically fragile democracies undermines institutional quality. The 2015 Syrian shock provides a particularly valuable exogenous case: a sudden, large-scale refugee inflow that bypassed domestic policy controls and provoked sharp political responses, allowing for clearer identification of immigration’s institutional effects. Second, democratic decline increases emigration, draining human capital and further weakening prospects for democratic recovery. Third, international integration—most notably through EU accession—conditions these dynamics, amplifying or dampening the outflow response to political change.
Taken together, these findings show that migration is not merely a symptom of political instability but also a driver of institutional transformation, simultaneously reinforcing and accelerating regime shifts toward illiberalism.</content>

    <title>The Theory of Financial Stability Meets Reality: A Unifying Framework for Bank Regulation and Accounting Discretion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature at the intersection of economics and finance offers prescriptions for regulating banks to increase financial stability. This literature abstracts from the discretion that accounting standards give banks over financial reporting, creating a gap between the information assumed to be available to regulators in models of optimal regulation and the information available to regulators in reality. We bridge insights from the economics, finance, and accounting literatures to synthesize knowledge about the design and implementation of bank regulation and identify areas where more work is needed. We present a simple framework for organizing the relevant ideas, namely the externalities that motivate bank regulation, the rationales for allowing accounting discretion, and the use of discretion to circumvent regulation. Our takeaway from reviewing work in these areas is that academic studies of bank regulation and accounting discretion require a more unified approach to design optimal policy for the real world.</content>

    <title>Automation-Induced Innovation Shift</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how exposure to automation affects the nature and level of corporate innovation, which informs how innovation begets innovation. We document that firms with high robot exposure alter their technological focus over time and shift innovative activities towards AI which automation naturally complements through data accumulation. The shift is more pronounced for firms with greater data generation or prior AI-related research experience. Because AI patents are more costly (e.g., in labor input), albeit more general and original, firms with high automation experience a significant rise in R&amp;D expenditure but an initial drop in patent quantity, before benefiting—an innovation “J-Curve.” Our findings not only resolve the puzzle that globally firms invent less despite the greater research effort amidst rising automation, but also provides insights on the heterogeneous paths of innovation, all of which we rationalize in a parsimonious dynamic equilibrium model.</content>

    <title>Social Substitution? Time Use Responses to Increased Workplace Isolation</title>

      <name>Benjamin W. Cowan &amp; Todd R. Jones</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how people adjust their time use when they experience an increase in time spent alone, which is a growing share of adults’ lives. We utilize the dramatic rise in remote work following the onset of the pandemic, which is associated with a large decline in time spent in the physical presence of non-household members during the workday, to observe the extent to which individuals substitute toward more in-person interactions in non-work settings. We first document that on days that individuals work from home, they spend 3.5 additional hours in activities spent entirely alone and over 5 fewer hours in activities that include any non-household members. We then use a difference-in-difference strategy to ask what happens to time allocations when workers are induced toward remote work by analyzing changes over time in how workers in teleworkable occupations—who experienced the lion’s share of the post-COVID increase in remote work—spend their time relative to workers in non-teleworkable occupations. Averaging over all days of the week, we see a relative increase in time spent in activities spent entirely alone by 32 minutes and a decrease in activities that include any non-household members by 38 minutes for workers in teleworkable jobs. Normalizing by the increase in average daily remote work time (46 minutes), these estimates are of a similar magnitude to what we observe in our descriptive analysis. When individuals are induced to work from home, they exhibit almost no substitution toward spending more time with others who are not in their household to make up for the loss of time with others at work.</content>

    <title>Measuring Neighborhood Change: The Issue of Ex Post Borders</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Edward L. Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko &amp; Braydon Neiszner</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do more populous neighborhoods grow less quickly than less populous areas?  Is local housing price growth associated with initial population density? The Longitudinal Tract Data Base’s (LTDB) panel of Census tracts is the standard tool for measuring neighborhood change.  The LTDB is based on 2010 Census tract boundaries, and Census tracts are partially designed so that they have a similar level of population.  In this paper, we show that defining neighborhoods to equalize ex post population levels can significantly impact estimated coefficients in regressions in which population changes are regressed on initial population levels or with variables that are correlated with initial population levels.  Most obviously, if neighborhood populations are ex post equalized, then a regression of population change on initial population must yield a coefficient of -1. We address this challenge by offering five alternative panels of tracts using 1970, 1980 and 1990 boundaries, which can be thought of as ‘reverse LTDBs’.  The significant mean reversion of both population and housing units that appear in the LTDB before 2000 either dramatically ameliorates or reverses using the reverse LTDB.  Comparing the LTDB with the reverse LTDB also finds that using tracts based on ex post borders also can influence estimated growth relationships where other tract-level attributes such as house price are correlated with initial population levels. This does not imply that using ex ante borders always is superior; earlier borders almost always means fewer observations, especially in rapidly growing areas.</content>

    <title>Firm Capacity Underutilization and the Measurement of Productivity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When estimating a production function, economists usually assume that firms fully employ all their available inputs. Contrary to this assumption, we document that underemployment of quasi-fixed inputs or low capacity utilization rates (CUR) is common across firms, especially in poor countries. Low CURs are correlated with supply-side constraints such as shortages of material inputs and electricity; they are also correlated with demand-side constraints such as a lack of access to markets. We show that when firms underemploy their quasi-fixed inputs, the assumptions behind standard production function estimation techniques-such as the control function approach-are invalid, and these techniques produce biased estimates of TFP. We demonstrate this using unique panel data from Ethiopia with information on actual and full capacity input demand. We find that measures of TFP that do not account for CUR considerably underestimate ’true’ productivity when CUR is low but not when CUR is high. This leads to an exaggeration of the TFP gap between rich and poor countries.</content>

    <title>Clean Rides, Healthy Lives: The Impact of Electric Vehicle Adoption on Air Quality and Infant Health</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first nationwide evidence on how electric vehicle (EV) adoption has improved both air quality and child health. We assemble a rich dataset from 2010–2021 that links county-level EV registrations to measures of air pollution, birth outcomes, and emergency department visits. The endogeneity of EV adoption is addressed using two complementary strategies: Two-way fixed effects and instrumental variables (IV).  The IV exploits the staggered rollout of Alternative Fuel Corridors as a source of exogenous variation in charging infrastructure that affected EV adoption. The estimates show that greater EV penetration significantly reduces nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a key pollutant linked to vehicular emissions. These improvements in air quality yield significant health benefits, including reductions in very low birth weight and very premature births, as well as fewer asthma-related emergency department visits among children ages 0 to 5. This is true even when potentially offsetting increases in pollution from the electricity generation needed to power EVs are accounted for.  The benefits are higher in the high-pollution counties with Alternative Fuel Corridors, where baseline exposures are greatest. The resulting reductions in very low birth weight births alone could generate annual benefits of $1.2 to $4.0 billion.  These findings underscore the dual environmental and public health benefits of EV adoption.</content>

    <title>Supply-Side Opioid Restrictions and the Retail Pharmacy Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While policymakers routinely limit the sale of goods thought to be of risk to public health, relatively less is known about whether and how these policies affect firm performance. Using 2000-2018 National Establishment Time-Series data and a difference-in-differences strategy, we show that state “pill mill” laws intended to reduce the overprescribing of opioids reduced retail pharmacy sales and employment. These reductions were most pronounced in highly competitive areas and for standalone pharmacies – two characteristics associated with pharmacy drug diversion. Meanwhile, pharmacies located across the border in states without a pill mill law experienced increases in sales and employment. Next, we show that state pill mill laws were associated with an increase in standalone pharmacy closures, though the total number of pharmacies was unchanged. Our results are consistent with these laws adversely affecting pharmacies filling inappropriate opioid prescriptions without meaningfully altering patient access to retail pharmacies.</content>

    <title>Interest Rate Caps and Bank Loan Supply: Locking out the Small Borrower in the Great Depression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of changes in an interest rate cap on small loan brokers in New Jersey during the Great Depression. Using newly constructed data on brokers and banks, we find that small loans declined sharply when the cap was lowered, and despite worsening economic conditions, they rebounded when the cap was raised back up. Consumers could not obtain alternative credit from banks, effectively shutting them out of the market. The cap had a permanent impact on the small loan market due to the large number of broker closures, thereby further reducing the availability of small loans and increasing market concentration. Our findings highlight the fundamental trade-off faced by policymakers: strict rate caps may protect borrowers from predatory lending but can eliminate necessary credit options for vulnerable populations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using field-experimental data (study-time tracking and randomized incentives), we identify a structural model of learning. Student effort is influenced by external costs/benefits and unobserved heterogeneity: motivation (willingness to study) and productivity (conversion rate of time into skill). We estimate academic labor-supply elasticities and skill technology. Productivity and motivation are uncorrelated. Low productivity, not low motivation, is the stronger predictor of academic struggles. School quality augments productivity and accelerates skill production. We find that dynamic skill complementarities arise mainly from children’s aging and from a feedback loop between investment activity and productivity, rather than from carrying forward past skill stocks.</content>

    <title>How Do Financial Conditions Affect Professional Conduct? Evidence from Opioid Prescriptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how healthcare providers’ opioid prescriptions are affected by changes in their home values, which proxy for shocks to their wealth. We find that providers increase opioid prescriptions when experiencing adverse financial conditions. Results are robust to including provider office–year fixed effects and using the subsample of providers who live far away from their offices, thereby largely ruling out a patient–demand explanation. Providers living in ZIP codes with price changes in the bottom half in 2007–2009 increased their opioid prescriptions in 2010–2012 by approximately 16% more than others. The effect is stronger among providers facing more provider competition and those serving vulnerable populations. Providers experiencing adverse financial conditions also receive more opioid-related payments from pharmaceutical companies. We also extend our analysis to ADHD medications, demonstrating a similar pattern of increased prescriptions under negative financial shocks, suggesting broader implications for other medical decisions. Our findings offer novel insights into professional conduct under personal financial pressure, with implications extending beyond healthcare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Producers in locational pricing markets have the ability to exercise market power by impacting the extent to which transport capacity constraints bind. We extend the single-location residual demand curve concept to a residual demand hypersurface that quantifies the impact of a supplier’s output change at one location on prices at all locations. This concept improves our ability to explain the offers suppliers submit in the Italian locational pricing electricity market and demonstrates why the locations of a firm’s generation capacity determines the size and direction of locational price changes associated with the divestment of a fixed amount of generation capacity.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Technology Transfer: Multinational Investment in China and Rising Global Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;US multinationals formed joint ventures in China for market access and lower labor costs. However, these ventures transfer technology to Chinese firms, fueling future competition. While individual firms weigh the risks to their own profits, they disregard the negative impact on other US firms and the broader economy, resulting in an over-investment that may reduce the US welfare. In our empirical analysis, industries with more joint ventures in China show positive spillovers to Chinese firms but negative outcomes for firms in the US. We develop a two-country model with oligopolistic competition, innovation, and joint ventures. For the US, the short-run gains from joint ventures are outweighed by long-run losses due to rising Chinese competition. Joint ventures benefit large US firms at the expense of small firms and the real wages of workers. A ban on joint ventures since 1999 would have boosted US welfare by 1.2 percent.</content>

    <title>When Will Entrepreneurs Choose to Make Themselves Replaceable?</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines when and why entrepreneurs choose to standardise their ventures and make themselves replaceable, extending Rajan's (2012) analysis within a property rights framework. A model is developed where entrepreneurs face finite pools of potential replacements and may remain with their ventures post-IPO, rather than retiring as in Rajan's setting. The analysis yields two main results. First, when worker effort is fully contractible, entrepreneurs never choose to standardise, preferring to remain irreplaceable to maximise their bargaining power. Second, when key workers exert non-contractible effort that affects firm value, standardisation becomes beneficial as it motivates worker performance while managing the entrepreneur's replaceability. The optimal level of standardisation increases with the entrepreneur's equity stake, creating a ``dead zone" where entrepreneurs retain control but will not sell to outsiders. I extend the model to allow replacement of both entrepreneurs and workers, showing that standardisation can serve to reduce the bargaining power of all participants. The findings provide testable predictions about the relationship between equity structures, replacement market depth, and organisational design choices, while highlighting the strategic trade-offs entrepreneurs face between maintaining founder-specific advantages and creating transferable value for investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the effects of moving away from violent environments into safer areas on migrants' academic achievement in the context of the Mexican war on drugs. Using student location choices across space and over time, we recover individual-level migration paths for elementary school students across all municipalities in Mexico. We find that students who were induced to leave violent areas due to increased violence experience academic gains after relocating to safer areas.  Students who migrated from municipalities in the 90th percentile of the violence distribution to municipalities in the 10th percentile experienced improvements of 5.3 percent of a standard deviation in their test scores two years after they migrated. These results appear to be explained by increases in school attendance and improvements in the learning environment after they moved.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using individual-level data from the Add Health surveys, we leverage idiosyncratic variation in gender composition across cohorts within the same school to examine whether being exposed to a higher share of female peers affects mental health and school satisfaction. We find that being exposed to a higher proportion of female peers, despite only improving school satisfaction for boys, improves mental health for both boys and girls. The benefits are greater among boys of low socioeconomic backgrounds, who would otherwise be more likely to be exposed to violent and disruptive peers. We find suggestive evidence that the mechanisms driving our findings are consistent with stronger school friendships for boys and better self-image and grades for girls.</content>

    <title>The Downside of Fertility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The fertility decline is everywhere in the world today. Moreover, the decline goes decades back in the histories of rich countries. Birthrates have been below replacement in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1970s, although further declines occurred after the Great Recession. The reasons for the declines from the 1970s to the early 2000s involve greater female autonomy and a mismatch between the desires of men and women. Men benefit more from maintaining traditions; women benefit more from eschewing them. When the probability is low that men will abandon traditions, some career women will not have children and others will delay, often too long. The fertility histories of the U.S. and those of many European and Asian countries speak to the impact of the mismatch on birth rates. The experience of middle income and even poorer nations may also be due to related factors. Various constraints that I group under matching problems have caused fertility to be lower than otherwise and imply that fertility has a “downside.”</content>

    <title>Dynamic Competition for Sleepy Deposits</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the implications of sleepy deposits and their impact on competition, bank value, and financial stability in the US banking sector. We first document the shopping behavior of depositors using novel data on account openings and closures. Depositors infrequently shop for deposits, with 5–15% of depositors opening a new account each year. Shopping behavior is idiosyncratic: deposit accounts are more likely to be closed due to the depositor either moving or dying than because the depositor switched to a new account offering higher rates or better services. Building on these facts, we develop an empirical model of the supply and demand for "sleepy deposits." In the model, banks face dynamic "invest-versus-harvest" incentives in competing for depositors who shop infrequently. We estimate the model and find that depositor sleepiness accounts for 58% of the average bank’s deposit franchise value. Sleepiness softens competition, particularly raising markups and franchise value for banks in low-concentration areas, as well as for banks with either low-quality deposit services or high marginal costs. Sleepiness also creates stability in the banking sector. For two main money center banks in the US, the probability of default after the Federal Reserve's 2022-2023 hiking cycle would have increased to more than 20% in a counterfactual without sleepy depositors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks can use the discount window to fend off a run by prepositioning assets with the Fed and borrowing against them. Following the March 2023 bank runs, policymakers have considered mandatory prepositioning, arguably the largest update to the lenderof-last-resort toolkit in over a century. We study the forces that shape the largest banks’ prepositioning. We show that run-prone uninsured-deposit flows causally drive prepositioning and that banks face a prepositioning stigma, even absent borrowing. Prepositioning is no panacea—banks still need good assets to borrow against—but it can help at the margin.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A county’s fraction of adults in 1990 on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a strong predictor of growth in local drug death rates after 2000.  The part of the SSDI rate related to drug deaths is not proxying for well-known contributors to the drug crisis, e.g. OxyContin.  Instead, it appears to capture the fraction of people in chronic pain.  We show that in the late 1990s, physicians began prescribing opioids more aggressively to treat pain. Taken together, our estimates suggest that drug deaths rates would be 43% lower in 2015 had prescribing practices stayed at 1995 levels.</content>

    <title>Inferring Fine-grained Migration Patterns across the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fine-grained migration data illuminate important demographic, environmental, and health phenomena. However, migration datasets within the United States remain lacking: publicly available Census data are neither spatially nor temporally granular, and proprietary data have higher resolution but demographic and other biases. To address these limitations, we develop a scalable iterative-proportional-fitting based method that reconciles high-resolution but biased proprietary data with low-resolution but more reliable Census data. We apply this method to produce MIGRATE, a dataset of annual migration matrices from 2010-2019 that captures flows between 47.4 billion pairs of Census Block Groups — about four thousand times more granular than publicly available data. These estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets, and improve accuracy and reduce bias relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze both national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document temporal and demographic variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance: for example, we find that people are increasingly likely to move to top-income-quartile CBGs and identify racial disparities in upward mobility. We also show that MIGRATE can illuminate important local migration patterns, including out-migration in response to California wildfires, that are invisible in coarser previous datasets. We publicly release MIGRATE to provide a resource for migration research in the social, environmental, and health sciences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the recent slow growth in manufacturing productivity. We show that nearly all measured TFP growth since 1987—and its post-2000s decline—comes from a few computer-related industries. We argue conventional measures understate manufacturing productivity growth by failing to fully capture quality improvements. We compare consumer to producer and import price indices. In rapidly changing industries, consumer price indices indicate less inflation, suggesting mismeasurement in standard industry deflators. Using an input-output framework, we estimate that TFP growth is understated by 1.7 percentage points in durable manufacturing and 0.4 percentage points in nondurable manufacturing, with no mismeasurement in nonmanufacturing industries.</content>

    <title>From Kin to Creed: Missions and the Reconfiguration of Social and Moral Order in Colonial Congo</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how colonial religious institutions reshaped traditional social structures in Africa. Focusing on the Congo, I examine the long-term effects of Christian missions that sought to replace kin-based authority with European-Christian notions of social and moral order. I combine newly digitized data on historical mission locations with an original survey of 975 respondents, measuring attitudes toward family and coethnics, social network composition, referral behavior in a job experiment, and moral values. To address concerns about endogenous mission placement, I construct two counterfactuals: missions that were initially established but later abandoned, and simulated locations that were historically suitable but never selected. I find that exposure to missions persistently reduced bias toward kin and coethnics and weakened the role of kinship ties in networks and referrals. It also eroded communal moral values, such as loyalty to one's group and deference to authority, without a corresponding rise in universal moral principles. Instead, these shifts reflect a redirection of identity and moral obligation from kinship and ethnicity toward religious affiliation. Historical records on mission personnel and infrastructure point to religious instruction and education as key transmission channels. Together, the findings suggest that colonial religious institutions profoundly reshaped the social and moral organization of colonized societies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on the canonical "bottleneck" model of Vickrey (1969), we show that carpooling and road pricing are highly complementary in addressing traffic congestion: they can be much more effective jointly than each one separately, and can improve commuter welfare without having to rely on the redistribution of government revenue. By contrast, technological advances that make time in traffic more comfortable or productive (e.g., self-driving cars), implemented without additional economic incentives, may result in zero improvement in social welfare.</content>

    <title>Test-Optional College Admissions: ACT and SAT Scores, Applications, and Enrollment Changes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses data from the largest college application platform in the U.S. to describe application and enrollment changes in response to widespread test-optional admissions adoption between 2018-2021. Although test-optional policies aimed to expand college access, underrepresented students did not apply to Elite colleges at higher rates and Elite colleges still received large numbers of high-scoring applications after tests became optional. Despite the oversupply of high-scoring applicants in the test-optional period, Elite colleges enrolled more lower-scorers with high grades, in particular first-generation and lower-income students. Enrollment in less selective colleges also increased among high-scorers, so test-optional policies may exacerbate undermatching.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence in Team Dynamics: Who Gets Replaced and Why?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in organizations. We ask: (1) How should a principal optimally deploy limited AI resources to replace workers in a team? (2) In a sequential workflow, which workers face the highest risk of AI replacement? (3) How does substitution with AI affect both the replaced and non-replaced workers’ wages? We develop a sequential team production model in which a principal can use peer monitoring—where each worker observes the effort of their predecessor—to discipline team members. The principal may replace some workers with AI agents, whose actions are not subject to moral hazard. Our analysis yields four key results. First, the optimal AI strategy stochastically replaces workers rather than fixating on a single position. Second, the principal replaces workers at the beginning and at the end of the workflow, but does not replace the middle worker, since this worker is crucial for sustaining the flow of information obtained by peer monitoring. Third, the principal may optimally underutilize available AI capacity. Fourth, the optimal AI adoption increases average wages and reduces intra-team wage inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the equilibrium and welfare implications of quantitative trade models with sector-level external economies of scale (EES). While empirical evidence highlights the importance of EES, prior work has examined their effects only in models without input-output linkages. Focusing on a small open economy, we derive an intuitive condition for equilibrium uniqueness that links trade elasticities, scale elasticities, and input-output coefficients. We further show that this same condition guarantees positive gains from trade, regardless of a country’s pattern of specialization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inflation surged in 2021-2023 from a classic fiscal shock: money and debt that financed huge spending, without a plan for repayment. Neither money nor supply shocks offer a coherent alternative explanation. Inflation eased, with no recession, once the fiscal shock was over. Higher interest rates could have brought inflation down earlier, but could not have stopped it. Going forward, higher interest rates will raise debt service costs, and thus perversely raise inflation unless fiscal policy can tighten. High debt and structural deficits also mean that the US may lose the fiscal space to borrow in the next crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As we approach Transformative Artificial Intelligence (TAI), there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of how it could reshape our economic models, institutions and policies. We propose a research agenda for the economics of TAI by identifying nine Grand Challenges: economic growth, innovation, income distribution, decision-making power, geoeconomics, information flows, safety risks, human well-being, and transition dynamics. By accelerating work in these areas, researchers can develop insights and tools to help fulfill the economic potential of TAI.</content>

    <title>Riding to Opportunity: Geographic and Household Effects from the Orphan Trains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between 1854 and 1929, approximately 200,000 children were transported from East Coast cities to new homes in the American West, motivated by the theory that a change of geography and household environment can transform lives. We leverage quasi-experimental variation in child placements to evaluate both whether being sent West improved outcomes relative to remaining in New York institutions, and whether variation in destination and foster household characteristics affected later life success. Linking tens of thousands of ``orphan train'' riders and comparable non-relocated children to Census records through 1940, we find no systematic evidence that relocation itself improved adult economic outcomes. Among children sent West, substantial variation in county-level economic opportunities also did not predict adult success. In contrast, the individual foster household income predicts children's later incomes, with an estimated intergenerational elasticity of about 0.2.</content>

    <title>Drivers of Digital Payment Adoption: Lessons from Brazil, Costa Rica, and Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital payment platforms can displace cash and extend financial services to underserved populations, yet many adults worldwide remain unbanked. Leveraging granular microdata on individual transactions and user characteristics, we argue that broad cash substitution via peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms depends on a “rapid low income-gradient”, the speed at which adoption spreads from affluent early users to lower-income groups. In three Latin American cases, Brazil’s Pix, Costa Rica’s Sinpe Móvil, and Mexico’s CoDi, we document that low adoption costs, strong network effects, coordinated supply-side integration, and early awareness efforts enabled Pix and Sinpe Móvil to reach nearly all income segments within five years, whereas CoDi remains characterized by low usage and predominantly high-income adopters.</content>

    <title>Climate Risk Exposure and Firms’ Climate Strategies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When exposed to greater physical and transition climate risks, are firms more likely to engage in climate mitigation, climate adaptation, or/and political strategies? This study examines this question and finds that firms exposed to greater physical and transition climate risks are less likely to undertake substantial mitigation efforts. Instead, they pursue other strategies. Specifically, firms exposed to greater physical climate risks are more inclined to pursue adaptation strategies, while firms facing higher transition climate risks are more likely to engage in anti-climate political strategies (such as lobbying against climate policies). The intensity of how firms manage their climate risks is influenced by their time horizon: the more myopic they are, the less they engage in climate mitigation and the more they oppose climate-friendly policies, thereby decreasing transition risks today while worsening their exposure to future physical and transition climate risks. Overall, this study provides insights into the (lack of) preparedness of the corporate sector for heightened climate risks.</content>

    <title>Asset Elasticities and Currency Risk Transfer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use administrative security-level data from the U.S. and Euro Area (EA) portfolios to estimate asset demand and supply elasticities by exploiting exogenous variation in bond-specific currency wedges. Employing a Bartik-style shift-share identification approach, we document extensive heterogeneity in investor demand responsiveness to exogenous changes in the price of currency risk, conditional on the issuer characteristics. Demand for AE-bonds is always inelastic, whereas for EM-bonds, elasticity depends on investor type and currency: insurance/pension, nonbanks and banks have finite-elastic demand for EM-bonds that are issued in their own (investor) currency. For EM-issuer-currency bonds, only EA non-bank investors increase the share of these bonds in their portfolio when currency wedges widen, suggesting they accept higher currency risk for higher returns. In response, issuers adjust their supply endogenously: an exogenous increase of 8 basis point in currency wedges leads to a 0.26% decline in local currency bond issuance relative to GDP. We develop a theoretical framework where debt issuance decisions take into account heterogenous demand of investors in terms of their response to changes in the price of currency risk.</content>

    <title>The Changing Nature of International Trade and its Implications for Development</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the relationship between international trade, trade policy, and development in light of the structural, policy, and geopolitical shifts that have transformed globalization over the past decade. While trade has historically supported development through both static and dynamic channels, we argue that the latter—those inducing structural transformation and institutional change—have been far more consequential for long-run development. Through access to global markets, participation in global value chains, and knowledge and technology transfers, and by providing an anchor for reform, trade and trade agreements have contributed to productivity gains, technological progress, quality and skill upgrading, and institutional change in many low- and middle-income countries. Yet, the conditions that enabled these effects—technologically driven declines in transportation and communication costs, fragmentation of the production process, liberal trade regimes, multilateralism and geopolitical stability—are changing. Automation, digitization, climate change, the return of industrial policy in advanced economies, and the rise of geopolitical rivalry are reshaping the global trade environment. In this new context, the scope for replicating past export-led growth successes is unlikely as two key growth mechanisms, access to the lucrative markets of advanced economies and knowledge sharing, are under threat. We discuss whether trade in services and the green transition may offer new opportunities, emphasizing that future prospects will depend on policy choices in large economies and the adaptability of developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the weekly evolution of child skills as measured by unique data from a widely-emulated early childhood home-visiting program developed in Jamaica, adapted to rural China, and applied in different versions worldwide. The design of the study avoids problems of endogeneity of inputs and lack of truly comparable measures of skills across children that plague previous econometric studies of child development. Skills that are nominally classified as the same, in fact, do not appear to share a common unit scale across levels. They are produced by skill-specific, lifecycle-stage-specific technologies. We formulate and estimate a new dynamic stochastic skill production model for multiple skills that is consistent with the evidence. We quantify the dynamics of early life learning. The model explains the “fadeout” of measures of learning by the emergence of new skills not properly measured. We investigate the role of ability in learning. We find important differences in learning patterns between boys and girls.</content>

    <title>Maternity Leave Extensions and Gender Gaps: Evidence from an Online Job Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the unintended consequences of maternity leave extension on gender gaps in the labor market. Using millions of job applications on an online job platform and the staggered extension of maternity leave across Chinese provinces, we find that an average increase (22%) in the length of paid maternity leave led to a 3.7 percentage point decrease in positive callbacks to female applicants relative to their male counterparts. In response, female job seekers submitted 4.4 more job applications, shifted toward jobs with 5.4% lower wages, and experienced 0.9 weeks longer job search duration than male applicants. We also find that government subsidies that partially cover firms' wage costs of extended maternity leave help alleviate its adverse impact on gender disparities in hiring.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the impact of perceived cancer risk on housing values using widely advertised national reclassifications of chemical carcinogenicity in the United States. Combining these information events with an empirical design that compares changes in house values closer to affected toxic plants against those farther away isolates the effect of cancer risk news from other local factors. Focusing on plants previously emitting reclassified carcinogenic chemicals, we estimate a 1-2% decline in housing values within a 3-mile radius compared to those located farther away. The effects are stronger in areas with higher media presence underscoring the role of salience as a mechanism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2022), Chinese cities witnessed a paradox: residential land and new house prices surged while transaction volumes plummeted. We attribute this to local governments’ active price management through supply controls, land acquisitions by Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs), and limits on new home sales permits. Cities more dependent on land sales and land-backed debt before the pandemic experienced greater price increases and price-volume divergence, with LGFVs buying more land at higher prices than other buyers. These interventions helped sustain fiscal financing but deepened developers’ financial distress, revealing unintended consequences of local governments’ fiscal strategies during downturns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We adopt a data-driven approach to measure trade fragmentation over the period 2015-2023. Countries are classified into three groups according to changes in their trade costs with the US and China: those shifting toward the US bloc, those shifting toward the China bloc, and those with no change in alignment. Roughly one-quarter of countries moved toward each bloc, while about half showed no realignment. We document that while cross-bloc trade costs rose, they were accompanied by falling within-bloc trade costs. We use a quantitative model to compute the real income effects of this reconfiguration of the global trade costs. The median country in the world, and the median country within each bloc, has 0.4-0.6% higher real income as a result of the observed decoupling, contrary to the widespread belief that fragmentation has been welfare-reducing. Finally, we find a modest amount of bloc misalignment: the median country moving to the US bloc would actually be better off moving to the China bloc, and vice versa. These results suggest that trade decoupling does not always follow trade-driven economic interests.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On April 2nd 2025, after markets closed, the United States announced steep “Liberation Day” tariffs against most of its trading partners, many of which announced retaliatory tariffs. Market uncertainty spiked, consistent with the magnitudes and scope of the tariffs being unexpected. The prospect of a global trade war sent US stock markets down over ten percent until the US “paused” its tariffs on April 9th 2025, whereupon markets recovered. Portfolios of the stocks of firms headquartered in “redder” (more Republicans per Democrat) counties lost more value during this window.</content>

    <title>The Traffic Noise Externality: Costs, Incidence and Policy Implications</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than 42 million Americans are exposed to medium or high levels of traffic noise. Despite its potentially large toll and unequal distribution, the economic costs, incidence, and policy implications of traffic noise have received limited attention in economics. We quantify the aggregate economic burden of this externality and its distribution across demographic groups by estimating homebuyers' willingness to pay for quieter environments. Using  quasi-experimental variation from the construction of noise barriers, we find that reduced traffic noise exposure leads to significant increases in house prices, implying that buyers are willing to pay a substantial premium for each decibel of noise reduction. In the five years before construction, we detect no differential pre-trends in prices between treated and control properties. Following construction, we observe an immediate and largely permanent 6.8% increase in prices within 100 meters, with smaller gains at greater distances. Information on each barrier's noise attenuation allows us to recover the willingness to pay per decibel of traffic noise. We calculate the aggregate economic cost of traffic noise at $110 billion nationwide. The economic burden is disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households, suggesting that the externality is regressive. The cost varies widely across cities, reflecting differences in noise levels, property values and population density. Based on our estimates, the socially efficient Pigouvian tax amounts to $974 per vehicle. A broad shift to electric vehicles -- which are  quieter than traditional vehicles -- could yield noise reduction benefits of $77.3 billion, concentrated among low-income families in dense urban areas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We review the economic literature on self-image, which conceptualizes identity as a set of beliefs about one’s core traits, values, goals, and social ties. Self-image concerns lead individuals to process information and make choices in non-standard ways that help affirm and protect certain valued identities. We first present the main cognitive mechanisms involved within a simple unifying framework. We then survey the extensive laboratory, online, and field experimental literature on the nature and behavioral implications of self-image concerns. We discuss in particular how they give rise to information and decision avoidance, motivated memory and beliefs, excuse-driven behavior, preferences for truth-telling, hypothetical bias, moral cleansing and moral licensing, collective identities, political preferences, and other forms of self-signaling or self-deception. We subsequently discuss common empirical strategies used to identify self-image concerns, as well as the threats to their validity and how to alleviate them. We conclude by outlining open questions and directions for future research on the belief-based approach to identity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge spillovers among firms are widely viewed as a key driver of agglomeration and growth, but are difficult to estimate cleanly. We randomly allocated an energy-efficient motor --- a “servo'” motor --- among leather-goods firms in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and tracked adoption, information flows, beliefs about energy savings, and other variables. We use the difference between actual exposure and expected exposure (from simulated randomization draws) to identify the effect of exposure. We find a robust positive effect of exposure to treated neighbors within a small geographic area (500 meters in our baseline specification) on information flows and adoption. A marginal value of public funds (MVPF) calculation taking learning spillovers into account yields a significantly larger value than one considering only treated firms and suggests that adoption subsidies would be a cost-effective policy intervention.</content>

    <title>Improving Judicial Protection in Intimate Partner Violence Cases: The Role of Specialized Courts and Judges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the large-scale implementation of a system of specialized domestic violence courts (SDVCs), an innovation in access to justice programs for potential victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) and offenders. Using individual-level administrative data from the universe of civil domestic violence cases in Puerto Rico during the period 2014-2020, we leverage the staggered opening of SDVCs across judicial regions to examine the consequences for victims’ judicial protection and offender recidivism. Access to SDVCs leads to a considerable 8 percentage points increase in the probability that judges issue a protection order and a 1.7 percentage point (15 percent) decrease in victim and offender reappearance rates within one year of the start of the case. Effects are more pronounced for cases in which parties have children in common and in which access to SDVCs is more limited. Linking the case data to administrative and survey data on judges, we show that the priorities of judges assigned to SDVCs play a prominent role in explaining these outcomes.</content>

    <title>Assessing Career Attainment via a Non-Wage Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a non-pecuniary measure of career achievement, seniority. Based on a database of over 150 million resumes, this metric exploits the variation in how long it takes workers to attain job titles. A person’s seniority is defined as the number of years it takes the median individual—within the same industry and firm size category—to achieve that person’s job title. Seniority aligns with standard markers of success—it is positively correlated with both wages and educational attainment. To demonstrate its value as a measure of career progression, we show that individuals with higher seniority levels in the public sector are more likely to transition to higher-paying positions in the private sector. When non-monetary factors influence career choice, evaluating labor market outcomes using non-wage measures, such as seniority, offers significant advantages.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chinese private portfolio equity outflows, though small compared to other Chinese outflows, are growing rapidly because of capital account liberalization and capital flight. Using granular stock-holding data on Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) mutual funds, we identify a nascent financial channel of international transmission of Chinese monetary policy to world stocks. Event study analysis around monetary policy announcement days reveals that monetary policy tightening depresses returns of country equity indexes and individual U.S. stocks with QDII fund exposure relative to non-exposed stocks. The results are robust to controlling for the real transmission channel of Chinese monetary policy and other confounders. The effect is driven by smaller and less liquid firms, but not by China-concept stocks or those highly exposed to China's macroeconomic shocks. We also find that the results are driven by household portfolio rebalancing from more to less risky assets following the announcement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the optimal allocation of population and consumption in a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model with frictional migration, where households' idiosyncratic location preference shocks are private information. We derive a recursive formula for the constrained-efficient allocation, capturing the trade-off between consumption smoothing and efficient migration. In a quantitative model calibrated to the US economy featuring both cross-state migration and risk-free savings, we find that the constrained-efficient allocation features lower population but higher average consumption in less productive states than the status quo, achieving efficiency and spatial redistribution simultaneously through dynamic incentives. In response to local negative productivity shocks, the constrained-efficient allocation features more front-loaded consumption than the status quo, with systematic heterogeneity linked to the location’s pre-shock fundamentals.</content>

    <title>Equity Frictions and Firm Ownership</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, I document systematic heterogeneity in ownership and financing of firms across Eurozone countries. To rationalize these differences, I build a quantitative general equilibrium model of workers and entrepreneurs who choose debt and equity financing of their firms, subject to rich country-specific financial frictions. The novel data on firm ownership and financing, combined with the structure of the model, allows me to quantify the level of debt and equity frictions in each country. Quantitatively, I find much larger output effects from equity frictions: harmonizing them across countries would lead to nearly four times larger output effects compared to debt frictions, and removing them would increase aggregate output by 75\% more. The larger impact on output is due not only to the estimated levels and dispersion of equity frictions, but also to the fact that equity provides greater risk sharing, which further incentivizes entrepreneurs to expand their firms. Through their effect on risk sharing, equity frictions also rationalize the observed negative relationship between equity financing and wealth inequality. Quantitatively, they are responsible for over 70\% of the explained variation in top wealth shares across countries.</content>

    <title>Türkiye's Homemade Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Türkiye's response to post-pandemic inflation is a cautionary tale of how political pressure for low interest rates can create macroeconomic instabilities. While central banks worldwide raised interest rates to combat inflation in 2021-2023, Turkish authorities pursued the opposite strategy: cutting real rates to deeply negative levels while implementing financial engineering tools, FX interventions, and financial repression to stabilize markets. The centerpiece was a novel FX-protected deposit scheme (KKM) that guaranteed depositors against currency depreciation, shifting exchange rate risk to the government balance sheet. We provide a detailed account of this policy experiment and develop a theoretical model focusing on how KKM functions and creates vulnerabilities. Our model reveals that pressure to keep interest rates below inflation-targeting levels can lead to an interconnected destabilizing sequence. Low rates generate inflation, current account deficits, and exchange rate depreciation. KKM provides partial stabilization by effectively raising rates for savers while maintaining low rates for borrowers. However, this creates growing contingent fiscal burdens and vulnerability to self-fulfilling currency and sovereign debt crises. This explains additional policies adopted including capital flow management, financial repression, and return to orthodox monetary policy. As central banks worldwide face renewed pressure to set lower policy rates, Türkiye's experience illustrates the consequences.</content>

    <title>Nature and Biodiversity Loss: A Research Agenda for Financial Economics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We outline a research agenda to better understand the economic and financial consequences of nature and biodiversity loss. Our starting point is a simple model in which ecosystem services—such as pollination, water filtration, and carbon sequestration—enter economic production, and where nature degradation and climate change reinforce one another through a “Twin-Crises Multiplier.” We then extend this framework to allow for heterogeneity across firms, industries, and geographies in how they depend on, and in turn affect, nature. This broader perspective provides a foundation for empirical analyses of how biodiversity loss influences aggregate output, firm productivity, and financial risk. We conclude by identifying opportunities for asset pricing and corporate finance research to systematically incorporate nature and biodiversity into financial economics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an asset-pricing model to evaluate the credibility of Hong Kong’s Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). Allowing for imperfect peg credibility, we derive closed-form solutions for exchange rates and option prices under potential regime shifts. Using HKD option data, we estimate market-implied probabilities of peg survival and the fundamental value of the HKD. Our results show that credibility fluctuates with U.S. interest rate hikes, local liquidity conditions, and Chinese currency dynamics. Compared with more standard Black-Scholes-based models, our approach provides more realistic assessments of peg sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study monotone ecological inference, a partial identification approach to ecological inference. The approach exploits information about one or both of the following conditional associations: (1) outcome differences between groups within the same neighborhood, and (2) outcomes differences within the same group across neighborhoods with different group compositions. We show how assumptions about the sign of these conditional associations, whether individually or in relation to one another, can yield informative sharp bounds in ecological inference settings. We illustrate our proposed approach using county-level data to study differences in Covid-19 vaccination rates among Republicans and Democrats in the United States.</content>

    <title>Beliefs and Realities of Work and Childcare After Childbirth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When women plan for life after childbirth, they form beliefs about work, childcare, and how their careers will unfold. These expectations shape key decisions but are formed under deep uncertainty. We use a 2019 state-contingent survey of 11,000 Danish women linked to administrative data to compare pre-birth beliefs to realized outcomes. Mothers accurately anticipate their eventual return to work but underestimate the duration of the career interruption. This miscalibration stems from two belief errors—about partner leave and own labor supply—which interact and persist even among second-time mothers, with implications for labor supply, planning, and policy design.</content>

    <title>Permanent Capital Losses after Banking Crises</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the mechanisms driving bank losses across historical banking crises in 46 economies and the effectiveness of policy interventions in restoring bank capitalization. We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations. Early liquidity interventions can avert banking crises, but only under specific conditions. Once large bank equity declines have occurred, policy responses have historically failed to prevent persistent undercapitalization in the banking sector.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a general-equilibrium model in which the safety of a country's currency and the choice of its exchange-rate regime arise endogenously. Calibrated to pre-2025 data, the model replicates the U.S. dollar’s safety premium, low Treasury yields, and its status as the world's anchor currency. Introducing a trade war that isolates U.S. goods markets from the world erodes the U.S. dollar's safety premium, raises U.S. interest rates, and lowers the world market value of U.S. firms. For sufficiently high tariffs, small economies optimally re-peg to the euro, precipitating a phase shift to a euro-centric international monetary system and a global welfare loss. The analysis implies that persistent trade wars may threaten the financial privileges the United States derives from the dollar’s international role.</content>

    <title>Aggregating Average Treatment Effects on the Treated in Difference-in-Differences Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For difference-in-differences methods, there has been great attention to obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects, especially when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. However, there has been little discussion of the importance of weights in aggregating those treatment effects into an overall average treatment effect on the treated. There are many possible ways to aggregate estimated cohort-time treatment effects. We show that the standard software used to estimate Callaway and Sant’Anna’s method uses weights that are not just the number of treated observations in treated years. Instead, the software uses weights that include the number of observations in the reference pre-period instead of only the number of observations in the treated periods. We discuss why the aggregation weights matter and under what circumstances the weights make the most difference.</content>

    <title>Financial Value of Nature: Coastal Housing Markets, Mangroves, and Climate Resilience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measuring the financial value of nature is difficult, often resulting in insufficient funding directed to nature conservation and restoration.  As coastal risks increase from development and climate change, a tangible benefit of nature is the protection it offers against storm damages.  Many studies from the risk industry and others assess the direct effects of wetlands for reducing damage during storms. However, the value of wetlands for coastal protection could extend to many other benefits, including home prices in areas where storms are common.  We use property-level housing transaction data from Zillow and show that proximity to mangroves in Florida moderates home price decline and dispersion following major hurricanes. The effects are substantial in magnitude, reducing the probability of losing a quarter or more of housing value by 2-7 percentage points, which corresponds to 20-40-thousand-dollar value for a million-dollar property, conditional on a hurricane.</content>

    <title>Making AI Count: The Next Measurement Frontier</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI is transforming production, consumption, and work, yet current statistical frameworks would likely struggle to capture its economic full economic impact. While the 2025 System of National Accounts introduces AI as a distinct asset, challenges remain in valuing AI-related investments, inputs, and outputs. Moreover, as a general-purpose technology, AI alters business processes, service quality, and labor organization in ways poorly reflected in official data. This paper outlines key measurement gaps from transformative AI, including the tracking cross-border inputs, quality change, and process changes. We argue that economic statistics should adopt more granular, task-based, and outcome-focused approaches to ensure relevance in an increasingly AI-driven economy.</content>

    <title>“No One Can Borrow” – Reassessing the “Junior Can’t Borrow” Equity-Premium Puzzle Resolution</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Junior Can’t Borrow,” Constantinides, Donaldson, and Mehra’s (CDM) three-period exchange model, eliminates borrowing by the young, and, consequently, all generations to resolve the equity premium puzzle. This paper examines CDM’s resolution in an 80-period, OLG model with capital, fiscal policy, macro shocks and steeply rising borrowing costs. Imposing such costs on all generations and, thereby, eliminating the bond market produces, as in CDM, a large premium. But permitting even one generation to sell bonds without transactions costs dramatically raises the safe rate, restoring the puzzle. Hence, “No One Can Borrow” not “Junior Can’t Borrow” is CDM’s real message. Since zero or low marginal-cost borrowing is commonplace – be it via secured borrowing or friends and family loans, CDM’s “solution” isn’t plausible. As in representative-agent RBCs, macro risk is low in OLG-RBCs – not because aggregate shocks are small, but because they can be hedged via self-insurance (saving) and largely average out over agents’ lifetimes. Indeed, absent high marginal borrowing costs, agents, even older ones, are close to indifferent between holding shares and holding bonds, rendering their net bond demand (supply) curves highly elastic. This explains why even a single generation is willing to supply significant amounts of bonds at a low price (high yield).</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide new evidence on earnings gaps between non-Hispanic White and three generations of Black workers in the United States during 1995-2024, using nationally representative data. Results reveal remarkable earnings advances among 2nd-generation Black immigrants, opposite to the well-documented widening in overall Black-White earnings gap. Among women, 2nd-generation Black workers have earnings higher than or equal to White women; among men, they earn 10% less at the median, but the gap vanishes at the top decile. The gap for 1st-generation Black men is shrinking, halving at the top decile; for 1st-generation Black women it shows initial widening then shrinking at the median. The native Black-White gap remains stubbornly high. Educational attainment largely drives 2nd-generation success, while residential patterns play a protective role for the 1st and 2nd generations. These findings provide critical data to set the record straight on the accomplishments of the highly successful and rising demography of Black immigrants and their US-born children.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decarbonizing aviation in the short term will likely entail replacing large quantities of petroleum jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), which are predominantly biofuels. In the United States, biofuels are currently used as substitutes for gasoline and diesel in road transportation and are supported by a complex set of federal and state policies including the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), state low carbon fuel standards, and state and federal tax credits. Policies promoting SAF therefore interact with surface transport biofuel policies. In this paper, we use a new detailed partial equilibrium model of road and air transportation fuel markets to compare various policy options designed to achieve a target of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030. Our results suggest that the target is attainable with current technology but not with current policy. Several potential federal policies, including modifications to the existing RFS, a federal SAF tax credit, or a clean aviation standard could meet the 3 billion gallon target with similar emissions reductions and costs but different incidence. The lowest cost policy we study entails replacing all current biofuels policies with a modest carbon tax on fossil transportation fuels paired with a SAF tax credit.</content>

    <title>Human Capital Accumulation Across Space</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how human capital shapes the economic geography of development. We develop a model in which the cost of acquiring human capital varies across space, and regions with higher human capital innovate more. Locations are spatially connected through migration and trade. There are localized agglomeration economies, and human-capital-augmenting technology diffuses across space. Using high-resolution data on income and schooling, we quantify and simulate the model at the 1° x 1° resolution for the entire globe. Over the span of two centuries, the model predicts strong persistence in the spatial distribution of development — unlike spatial dynamic models without human capital, which predict convergence. Proportionally lowering the cost of education in sub-Saharan Africa or Central and South Asia raises local outcomes but reduces global welfare, whereas the same policy in Latin America improves global outcomes. An alternative policy equalizing educational costs across sub-Saharan Africa generates relatively worse outcomes, as population reallocates within the region toward less productive areas. Central to these results is the estimated negative correlation between the education costs and local fundamentals, as well as inefficiencies in the spatial allocation due to externalities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multifaceted social protection programs in low-income countries often include both capital grants and informational and behavioral support on the premise that households face simultaneous and multiple frictions. To tackle informational and behavioral constraints, programs typically deploy either individual or group coaching visits from field agents. The relative efficacy of individual versus group coaching could provide insights into the underlying mechanism through which information and behavioral support change household decisions. However, in three similar randomized evaluations in Uganda, the Philippines, and Bangladesh, we find no differences in efficacy. Given its 15–20% lower costs, group coaching is more cost-effective.</content>

    <title>Bond Convenience Yields in the Eurozone Currency Union</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a monetary union, the risk-free rate cannot adjust to country-level fiscal positions, leaving only default spreads and convenience yields to respond. Empirically, we find that convenience yields explain a large share of the variation in Eurozone sovereign bond yields. Eurozone sovereign bonds earn larger convenience yields when their governments run larger surpluses. Since convenience yields generate substantial seigniorage revenue from debt issuance, our estimates imply economically large fiscal costs from low convenience yields for peripheral countries in the Eurozone.</content>

    <title>FCI-plot: Central Bank Communication Through Financial Conditions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of central bank communication where market participants' uncertainty about desired financial conditions creates misunderstandings ("tantrums") and amplifies the impact of financial noise on asset prices and economic activity. We show that directly communicating the expected financial conditions path (FCI-plot) eliminates tantrums and recruits arbitrageurs to insulate conditions from noise, while communicating expected interest rates alone fails to achieve these benefits. We demonstrate that scenario-based FCI-plot communication enhances recruitment when participants disagree with the central bank regarding scenario probabilities. This enables an "agree-to-disagree" equilibrium where markets help implement central bank objectives despite differing views.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive global issue, with approximately one in three women experiencing IPV over their lifetime. IPV prevalence is higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and costs of IPV are also considerably larger as a percentage of GDP in LMICs.  We present the economic theory behind IPV and highlight some important determinants such as poverty and societal norms. We then synthesize the causal evidence on the impact of a range of policies and interventions, highlighting approaches which have been effective in reducing IPV. We identify key insights from the existing literature and outline areas where further theoretical and empirical research is needed.</content>

    <title>Fractional Ownership and Copyright Licensing: Evidence from the Music Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creative content is often the product of collaboration, which may lead to fractional ownership of intellectual property. We study the effect of fractional ownership on the licensing of copyrighted material and its reuse. To do so, we compile new data on the copyright ownership structure of songs and their licensing for use in movies. We document that fractional song ownership has increased substantially: the mean number of songwriters and publishers per song has tripled between 1958 and 2021. We show that, conditional on a rich set of controls, greater fractionalization is associated with lower likelihood of licensing. We leverage the Sony-led acquisition of EMI Music Publishing in 2012 to obtain within-song variation in ownership and find that consolidating ownership rights significantly increases licensing, beyond any standalone effects of the merger.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents new stylized facts about returns and cashflow growth rates on stocks and housing over decade-long holding periods. While cashflow growth rates on the two assets comove positively, their returns comove negatively until the Global Financial Crisis and positively thereafter. These facts present a puzzle for representative-agent models that imply positive return comovement for assets with similar cashflows. I consider a heterogeneous-agent model with segmented stock and housing markets connected through credit. News about the aggregate economy generates negative return comovement. Recent shifts such as wealthier homebuyers and institutional housing purchases reduce the importance of credit and segmentation.</content>

    <title>The Past and Future of U.S. Structural Change: Compositional Accounting and Forecasting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the evolving significance of different production sectors within the U.S. economy since World War II and provide methods for estimating and forecasting these shifts. Using a compositional accounting approach, we find that the well-documented transition from goods to services is primarily driven by two compositional changes: 1) the rise of Intellectual Property Products (IPP) as an input producer, replacing Durable Goods almost one-for-one in terms of input shares in virtually all sectors; and 2) a shift in consumer spending from Nondurable Goods to Services. A structural model replicating these shifts reveals that the rise of IPP at the expense of Durable Goods is largely explained by increases in the efficiency of IPP inputs used in production: input-biased technical change. Trend variations in sectoral total factor productivity, and their attendant effects on relative prices and income, are the main driver of evolving consumption patterns. Both reduced-form and structural forecasts project these trends to continue over the next two decades, albeit at lower rates, indicating a slower pace of structural change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a fracturing world, how can low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) continue to leverage trade for economic development? Drawing on recent research at this intersection, this review argues that countries should look inward toward domestic reforms in key factor markets. I review evidence on how trade in LMICs is shaped by frictions in labor, capital, material, land, and information markets, and highlight areas where the evidence base remains thin. I concluded with a discussion of vertical policies relevant for LMICs—particularly the role of services—and suggest areas where further research is needed to assess whether development can be service-led.</content>

    <title>Child Maltreatment Investigations and Family Well-being</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over one third of children in the U.S. are investigated by the child protection system (CPS) by age 18, but the effects of this interaction on families and children are largely unknown. Investigations aim to protect children from harm and direct services to families in need. However, they also bring the implicit threat of child removal, which can generate both stress and institutional distrust among affected families. Using a regression discontinuity design, we study the impacts of this interaction on child health. Children who are just above the threshold for being “defaulted” into an investigation see a reduction in injuries and an increase in preventative care in the two months following the referral. Effects are consistent across child gender, race and age. Finally, investigations increase the likelihood that a parent is jailed, suggesting that investigations also detect criminal activity within the home. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that it is the investigation, rather than home removal or parental criminal justice system involvement, which improves child health.</content>

    <title>Racial Differences in Nursing Home Value Added</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use detailed data on the evolution of health for about 0.8 million Black and 5.4 million white nursing home patients covered by Medicare between 2011 and 2019 to estimate race-specific value-added measures for more than 8,000 nursing homes in the United States. We estimate that the average nursing home value-added experienced by Black patients is about 30% lower than that received by white patients. Most of this gap reflects differences in value-added experienced by similar Black and white patients within the same nursing home, rather than differences in value-added across the nursing homes they go to.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents that during the late 20th Century, nominal government bonds and stocks tended to comove positively, whereas during the first quarter of the 21st Century they have tended to comove negatively.  A similar sign switch is observable for real government bonds and breakeven inflation rates.  Recent macroeconomic events have caused short-lived changes in these comovements, and periods with high risk premia tend to be periods in which bond-stock comovements are large in absolute value.  The paper surveys theoretical models of these phenomena.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Genetic Predisposition to a Higher BMI on Education Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of early-life health on education by estimating the effect of genetic predisposition to a higher body mass index (BMI) on educational attainment and related outcomes. The identification strategy exploits the randomness in which genes one inherits from one's parents by estimating sibling fixed effects models of the polygenic score for a higher BMI. These models are estimated using rich administrative data from Denmark for over 14,000 full siblings. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the genetic predisposition to a higher BMI is associated with a 1.4 percentage point (4.4%) lower probability of earning a high school diploma, a 1.7 percentage point (12.3%) lower probability of a college degree, and a 1.7 percentage point (3.7%) higher probability of vocational training. An investigation into mechanisms suggests that youth with a greater genetic predisposition to a higher BMI are more likely to report being bullied, have greater school absences, and lower test scores.</content>

    <title>Not Flourishing</title>

      <name>David G. Blanchflower &amp; Alex Bryson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine evidence on the well-being and ill-being of the young for 22 countries in the Global Flourishing Study (GFS) 2022-2024 with the commonly used 12-component “flourishing” index and a new 4-component “not flourishing” index.  Although flourishing is U-shaped in age in the pooled data it rises in age in 13 countries and declines in 7.  By contrast, not-flourishing declines in age overall, and in each of its four components, and it declines in age in 15 of the 22 countries.  We explore sensitivity of results to survey mode in countries using both computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and computer-assisted web-based interviews (CAWI).  When CATI is used, the young are happier than other age groups, but the opposite is the case when data are collected via CAWI.  We validate the findings with analyses from two other data sets.  First, we construct flourishing and not flourishing indices using different variables for the four European countries in the GFS - Germany, Spain, Sweden and UK - from the interviewer based European Social Survey (ESS) of 2023-2024.  As with the GFS, the not-flourishing data shows ill-being declines in age while the flourishing data is more mixed.  Second, we examine the internet-based Global Minds (GM) surveys, 2020-2025, on the same group of countries, and find well-being rises in age for all in both flourishing and not-flourishing variables.  We argue that trends in youth suicide, self-harm and mental health hospitalizations are consistent with the age patterns in the not-flourishing index and with the internet-based survey evidence from both the flourishing and not-flourishing indexes.</content>

    <title>Climate Change, Conflict, and the Risk of Economic Collapse in Africa</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is human-caused climate change likely to trigger enduring economic decline in modern societies? We study whether changes in violent conflict and economic growth caused by warming could interact to degrade economic opportunities and trap African countries in poverty. We provide evidence of an emerging high-conflict and low-growth "poverty trap" equilibrium in Africa and describe theoretically how such an equilibrium could result from warming. We then combine historical data on temperature, growth, and conflict with projections from a large ensemble of global climate models to evaluate the risk that warming and subsequent conflict could push African economies into a regime of sustained negative economic growth. We find that the risk of such "economic collapse" is material in a moderate-to-high emissions scenario. We estimate that in Africa, a current "high" emissions trajectory (RCP 7.0) may increase the incidence of conflict 5.1 percentage points (95% CI 0.2-13.0) and increase the share of countries with net negative GDP growth this century by 12.2 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-27.5).  We calculate that roughly 82% of this additional conflict risk and 14% of projected GDP losses are due to the interacting effects between these two outcomes, underscoring the importance of accounting for their indirect effects and feedbacks. Our findings suggest an unprecedented scale of emissions mitigation, economic policy innovation or institutional investment that would be required to contain the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change in many African countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a theory of firm dynamics and capital reallocation in private firms and use it to study the taxation of business income, capital, and capital gains. Intangible assets—such as customer bases and trade names—are created using owners' time and are infrequently traded in bilateral meetings. We discipline the model with U.S. administrative data, which report purchase prices and counterparties in asset transfers, allowing us to calibrate the investment technology and output elasticity for otherwise unobservable intangible capital. The equilibrium features dispersion in marginal product of capital, transferable share of firm value, and return on business wealth. Introducing taxation, we find that capital gains taxes are most distortionary, primarily by discouraging entry and reallocation of capital, whereas income taxes are least distortionary.</content>

    <title>The Impact of AI and Digital Platforms on the Information Ecosystem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable model to study how AI and digital platforms impact the information ecosystem. News producers — who create truthful or untruthful content that becomes a public good or bad — earn revenue from consumer visits. Consumers search for information and differ in their ability to distinguish truthful from untruthful information. AI and digital platforms influence the ecosystem by: improving the efficiency of processing and transmission of information, endangering the producer business model, changing the relative cost of producing misinformation and altering the ability of consumers to screen quality. We find that in the absence of adequate regulation (accountability, content moderation, and intellectual property protection) the quality of the information ecosystem may decline, both because the equilibrium quantity of truthful information declines and the share of misinformation increases; and polarization may intensify. While some of these problems are already evident with digital platforms, AI may have different, and overall more adverse, impacts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Immunotherapy is a breakthrough innovation in cancer care but is also among the most expensive treatments, with costs exceeding $150,000 per patient. We study the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the most widely used class of immunotherapy drugs. In 2022, ICIs accounted for 44% of the $17.5 billion Medicare Part B cancer drug spending. We focus on metastatic melanoma, the first approved indication for ICIs. While overall cancer mortality rates declined since the 1990s, melanoma mortality rates increased through the early 2010s. Following the first ICI approvals in 2011 and 2014, melanoma mortality declined sharply. Using traditional Medicare claims, we estimate the impact of the introduction of ICIs on healthcare utilization, costs, and 1-year survival for patients with metastatic melanoma, relative to metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), where ICIs were not approved until 2017. Variation in approval timing allows us to isolate the effect of ICIs from broader cancer care trends. We find that ICIs reduced 1-year mortality by 6.2%. Since about 1 in 5 metastatic melanoma patients received ICIs, this implies a 27.5% reduction among treated patients. The introduction of ICIs also reduced chemotherapy and radiation use, but increased Medicare spending by 59.3% or about 260% among ICI-treated patients. Accounting for life expectancy gains beyond one year, the benefits of ICIs for melanoma patients appear comparable, or potentially even greater, than the substantial added Medicare costs. Nonetheless, ICI use remains relatively low given large survival benefits and few alternative treatments, suggesting that costs and other barriers limit patient access.</content>

    <title>Genius on Demand: The Value of Transformative Artificial Intelligence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the emergence of transformative AI systems providing ``genius on demand" would affect knowledge worker allocation and labour market outcomes. We develop a simple model distinguishing between routine knowledge workers, who can only apply existing knowledge with some uncertainty, and genius workers, who create new knowledge at a cost increasing with distance from a known point. When genius capacity is scarce, we find it should be allocated primarily to questions at domain boundaries rather than at midpoints between known answers. The introduction of AI geniuses fundamentally transforms this allocation. In the short run, human geniuses specialise in questions that are furthest from existing knowledge, where their comparative advantage over AI is greatest. In the long run, routine workers may be completely displaced if AI efficiency approaches human genius efficiency.</content>

    <title>What Can Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning Measure?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Satellite imagery and machine learning (SIML) are increasingly being combined to remotely measure social and environmental outcomes, yet use of this technology has been limited by insufficient understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Here, we undertake the most extensive effort yet to characterize the potential and limits of using a SIML technology to measure ground conditions. We conduct 115 standardized large-scale experiments using a composite high-resolution optical image of Earth and a generalizable SIML technology to evaluate what can be accurately measured and where this technology struggles. We find that SIML alone predicts roughly half the variation in ground measurements on average, and that variables describing human society (e.g. female literacy, R²=0.55) are generally as easily measured as natural variables (e.g. bird diversity, R²=0.55). Patterns of performance across measured variable type, space, income and population density indicate that SIML can likely support many new applications and decision-making use cases, although within quantifiable limits.</content>

    <title>Incorporating Non-Unitary Income Elasticities, Choke Prices and Choke Incomes into Applied General-Equilibrium Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional applied general-equilibrium (AGE) models have always faced trade-offs between analytical and computational tractability and counter-empirical restrictions. One is the assumption of homothetic preferences implying unitary income elasticities of demand, significantly inconsistent with data. Similarly, there is no “choke” income level, below which a certain good is not purchased and there is no choke price above which a good is not purchased, implying no changes in the extensive margin of trade. Here I exploit what I will label a Stone-Geary Modified (SGM) formulation. This produces a model in which there are non-unitary income elasticities, choke income levels for some/all goods, and choke prices. The second approach modifies CRIE (constant relative income elasticity) preferences which are preferred for modeling income elasticities, but don’t by themselves permit choke income and prices. While other authors have explored these properties in alternative ways, both my approaches have considerable advantages for high-dimension simulation models in that they retain CES structures and functional forms so that they can slot right into existing modeling formats. They require only small modifications to off-the-shelf cost and expenditure functions, and therefore goods and factor demand functions via Shepard’s lemma. Unobserved parameters can be calibrated from observed data and econometric estimates.</content>

    <title>Understanding and Addressing Temperature Impacts on Mortality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature documents how ambient temperature affects human mortality. Using decades of detailed data from 30 countries, we revisit and synthesize key findings from this literature. We confirm that ambient temperature is among the largest external threats to human health, and is responsible for a remarkable 5-12% of total deaths across countries in our sample, or hundreds of thousands of deaths per year in both the U.S. and EU. In all contexts we consider, cold kills more than heat, though the temperature of minimum risk rises with age, making younger individuals more vulnerable to heat and older individuals more vulnerable to cold. We find evidence for adaptation to the local climate, with hotter places experiencing somewhat lower risk at higher temperatures, but still more overall mortality from heat due to more frequent exposure. Within countries, higher income is not associated with uniformly lower vulnerability to ambient temperature, and the overall burden of mortality from ambient temperature is not falling over time. Finally, we systematically summarize the limited set of studies that rigorously evaluate interventions that can reduce the impact of heat and cold on health. We find that many proposed and implemented policy interventions lack empirical support and do not target temperature exposures that generate the highest health burden, and that some of the most beneficial interventions for reducing the health impacts of cold or heat have little explicit to do with climate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much can AI accelerate progress in different research fields?  This paper shows that three features—the share of research tasks AI performs, the productivity of AI at those tasks, and the strength of bottlenecks—are key determinants of AI’s implications in any area, from cancer therapeutics to software design. The model maps changes in AI capabilities to research outcomes, quantifies the “marginal returns to intelligence,” and shows how AI can shift returns to R&amp;D investment. Concepts like superintelligence, Powerful AI, and Transformative AI are further engaged and disciplined.  Finally, the framework sets a measurement agenda linking AI benchmarks to field-specific opportunities for accelerating progress.</content>

    <title>What Does It Take? Quantifying Cross-Country Transfers in the Eurozone</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compute the cross-country transfers that result from unconventional monetary policy in the Eurozone. The ECB funds the expansion of its aggregate balance sheet mostly by issuing bank reserves and cash in core countries. The national central banks (NCBs) in periphery countries then borrow from the core NCBs at below-market rates to fund the asset purchases and bank lending. In addition, NCBs in the periphery lend more to their own banks at below-market rates. To compute the cross-country transfers, we compare the resulting cross-country distribution of NCB income to a counterfactual scenario without the ECB and without non-marketable intra-Eurozone debt. We document significant and persistent transfers from the core to the periphery.</content>

    <title>Private Equity, Consumers, and Competition: Evidence from the Nursing Home Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how product market competition shapes the impact of private equity (PE) acquisitions on consumers. We examine nursing home buyouts and observe that PE-owned facilities exhibit greater competitive sensitivity: competing more aggressively when competitive incentives are strong and exploiting market power more aggressively when competitive incentives are weak. We find that PE-owned facilities are more sensitive to local market competition—even when comparing effects only across facilities purchased as part of the same acquisition—and are more responsive to a pro-competitive policy helping consumers compare facilities. This suggests that the competitive sensitivity of acquirers and the concentration of markets where acquisitions occur are important factors contributing to the effects of a merger, as well as that pro-competitive polices can reshape the effects of PE ownership on consumers.</content>

    <title>Tariffs as Fiscal Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The year 2025 brought a remarkable shift in the role of tariffs in the US economy, as the Trump administration simultaneously escalated the use of broad tariffs and ensured that Congress enacted large income tax cuts. This fiscal switch has important implications for the US tax system. While maintaining tariff rates at summer 2025 levels would generate large government revenues, such broad tariffs have significant downsides: Efficiency losses would approach one-third of revenues raised, the tax system would be less progressive, and there would be serious tax administration concerns. The fiscal shift also has significant macroeconomic implications, although probably not the intended ones. Broad tariffs generate a large negative supply shock, simultaneously raising prices and reducing macroeconomic activity.</content>
