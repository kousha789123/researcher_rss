    <title>Over‐the‐Counter Markets for Nonstandardized Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a search and bargaining model of over‐the‐counter markets for nonstandardized assets of heterogeneous quality. Once matched, investors privately learn their values positively correlated with asset quality. Bargaining results in delay that is hump‐shaped in quality and U‐shaped in asset turnover. We document these patterns in commercial real estate and corporate bonds markets. Extreme qualities are little affected by changes in asset standardization, while intermediate qualities are more susceptible. For nonstandardized assets, opacity ensures active trading of all assets, which explains why their trading is decentralized and suggests that trade centralization should come with greater standardization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The method dialogue by Blakely McShane and Ulf Bockenholt (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025) provides a strong critique of the way behavioral scholars have analyzed and presented their findings. The initial document was sent to four established scholars who agreed to provide open collaborative guidance to the authors. Following the accepted revised document, the collaborating authors and others provide their final reactions below.Christian Wheelersummarizes and clarifies the recommendations of McShane and Bockenholt and assesses their effect on current research practices. He views that single‐paper meta‐analysis improves theory development in the social sciences by enabling researchers to better understand the inherent variability in empirical relationships.</content>

    <title>Neighbors as strangers or friends? How consumer's self‐construal affects the weight of neighbor information in residence decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although everyone must make decisions about where to live, we know little about how consumers perceive social interactions with neighbors and incorporate information about neighbors into their residence decisions. This article explores the impact of consumers' self‐construal on the importance they attribute to neighbor information when choosing a residence. Across seven preregistered studies, including lab experiments and online surveys, the findings consistently show that independent consumers, compared with interdependent ones, place greater importance on information about potential neighbors. This tendency stems from independent consumers' stronger desire for social closeness with neighbors, prompting them to place more weight on information that will help them find neighbors with whom they could become friends.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence-Powered Digital Streamers in Online Retail: Empirical Insights and Design Strategies from Experiments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital streamers gain popularity in live commerce, online retailers face critical questions about the actual business value of their operations. This study offers timely, evidence-based insights into the economic impact and optimal design of digital streamers. Although current designs do not significantly improve sales over no live streaming, incorporating behavioral realism—especially enhanced real-time question and answer (Q&amp;A)—can boost sales by 25%, making digital streamers as effective as human hosts. Visual upgrades and human-like voices also help but to a lesser degree. Importantly, not all AI-driven enhancements deliver immediate returns, and imitating human scripts does not guarantee success. Retailers should focus on dynamic human-AI interaction features that drive engagement and trust, such as real-time Q&amp;A and interactive giveaways. Designers are encouraged to integrate multiple realism features to maximize effectiveness while managing cost and scalability. These findings offer actionable guidance for retailers and platform designers seeking to leverage AI effectively and cost efficiently in live streaming commerce.</content>

    <title>Hiring entrepreneurs for innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What human capital do established organizations need to bring new ideas to market? Combining Danish registry and Community Innovation Survey data, we document a robust positive relationship between hiring former founders and firms' sales from innovation. Entrepreneurs join smaller, younger firms (which exhibit larger effects), managerial skills and external industry founding experience matter, while other selection or human capital‐based explanations appear muted. Founder hires especially enhance innovation when given middle management decision rights, for incremental offerings, and in innovation‐active firms. Our collective findings indicate startup experience equips founders with a generalist ability to acquire and mobilize resources around new ideas. By clarifying the nature of entrepreneurial human capital, we highlight a novel innovation input that helps firms unlock its commercial value.Managerial SummaryAs entrepreneurial careers proliferate, former founders represent a growing pool of potential employees with expertise in bringing new products and services to market. Can hiring entrepreneurs help established organizations enhance innovation? Using data from Denmark, we answer this question affirmatively and offer several explanations. Former founders gravitate towards younger, smaller established firms, where effects are stronger; they also bring valuable managerial skills and external industry founding experience. Notably, they generate more value when given broader authority as middle managers, for less obvious resource combinations, firms already active in innovation or research and development, and higher uncertainty contexts. Taken together, our findings suggest former founders' distinct combination of skills helps firms marshal resources around new offerings.</content>

    <title>Marijuana Legalization and Firms’ Cost of Equity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;After medical marijuana legalization (MML) by U.S. states, firms’ cost of equity (COE) decreases, especially for those with more growth opportunities, higher productivity, or a more skilled workforce. This policy change also reduces firm risk and leads to an increase in labor supply through increased labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and net migration. Further, home prices rise after MML, reflecting increased local housing demand due to a growing supply of workers. These findings align with theoretical models that link asset prices to labor markets and suggest that MML can lower firms’ COE by mitigating labor search frictions.</content>

    <title>The Propagation of Cyberattacks through the Financial System: Evidence from an Actual Event</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the effects of a multiday cyberattack that forced offline a technology service provider (TSP) to the banking sector. The attack impaired customers’ ability to send payments through the TSP, but the business continuity plans of banks and the TSP reduced the effect by more than half. Large banks performed better. Through contagion, banks not directly exposed to the attack experienced a liquidity shortfall, causing them to borrow funds or tap reserves. The ability to send payments after hours helped avoid further contagion. These results highlight the importance of preparedness by the private and official sector for cyberattacks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aggregate U.S. bank lending to firms expanded following the outbreak of COVID‐19. Using loan‐level supervisory data, we show that this expansion was driven by draws on credit lines by large firms. Banks that experienced larger credit line drawdowns restricted term lending more, crowding out credit to smaller firms, which reacted by reducing investment. A structural model calibrated to match our empirical results shows that while credit lines increase total bank credit in bad times, they redistribute credit from firms with high propensities to invest to firms with low propensities to invest, exacerbating the decrease in aggregate investment.</content>

    <title>Conquering the Divide? The Role of Political Polarization in the Destigmatization of a U.S. Medical Marijuana Platform Market</title>
    <updated>2025-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A documented recent rise in the polarization of American legislative politics underscores the question of how increasing political polarization affects organizations and industries. Yet, organizational scholars have not directed significant attention to the impact of polarization. In this paper, we demonstrate that political polarization may play an important role in organizational dynamics by revealing that polarization may expedite the destigmatization of legal yet historically stigmatized industries. To this end, we develop a theory explaining how political polarization normalizes counter-normative behavior and encourages customers to become open about their engagement with stigmatized products and organizations—a key step toward industry destigmatization. We further argue that this polarization impact may vary across regional markets because of differences in local legitimation processes that can either amplify (normative legitimacy) or attenuate (regulatory legitimacy) the effect of polarization on consumer engagement with a stigmatized industry. We find empirical evidence for our theorizing in analyses of all U.S. dispensaries of medical marijuana that existed on the online platformWeedmaps.comfrom its beginning in 2008 to 2014. Ultimately, this paper suggests that political polarization can significantly influence organizations and industries and thus warrants more systematic investigation and attention from organizational scholars, particularly in stigmatized industries.</content>

    <title>Connected to a Sinking Ship? Firm Performance in a Besieged Autocracy</title>
    <updated>2025-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Doing business in an autocracy that still permits the existence of markets is fundamentally different than operating under a democracy. This variety of state capitalism, termed authoritarian capitalism, requires specific form of political connections to the regime in order to survive and, in some cases, to thrive. However, authoritarian governance has another defining feature—namely paroxysms of political violence of different modalities, a phenomenon that can harm business but may benefit those who are connected to the regime. This paper examines life under a particular authoritarian capitalist state, 19th-century tsarist Russia, via an examination of one politically connected firm, the full-service steamship firm Kavkaz i Merkurii (Caucasus and Mercury). Using never-before-utilized company archival material to examine the firm’s relationship with the tsar, I find that management directly pursued intense business linkages with the government, even appointing tsarist officials and members of the royal family to leadership positions. This behavior increased even as political violence skyrocketed throughout Russia. A formal empirical analysis shows that this strategy was mostly beneficial for the firm, as some forms of political violence were received positively by shareholders as a source of new business. However, military action that drew heavily on the firm—where the government was underpaying relative to market rates—was perceived negatively by investors, and violence, which could have threatened the regime, manifested in higher long-term volatility. This paper shows both the benefits and costs associated with political connections under authoritarian capitalism.</content>

    <title>Litigation risk and IPO underpricing: evidence from federal judge ideology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using federal judge ideology as an exogenous measure of issuing firms’ litigation risk, we document that the initial public offerings (IPOs) of the firms headquartered in more liberal circuits are more underpriced. The effect is mitigated when plaintiffs’ pleading standards are more stringent and is amplified when judges have more discretion in their decisions. The effect is also amplified among deep pocketed issuing firms, while it is mitigated among issuing firms hiring reputable intermediaries in the IPO process. The results of additional analysis suggest that issuing firms located in more liberal circuits are more likely to become targets of lawsuits after their IPOs and that these lawsuits are less likely to be dismissed by the courts and result in larger settlements. Collectively, our findings underscore the salience of litigation risk stemming from the issuing firms’ legal environment in driving IPO underpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A war‐related factor model derived from textual analysis of media news reports explains the cross section of expected stock returns. Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects.</content>

    <title>The global sourcing of green products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have seen a rise in global trade of “green products”—those designed to minimize environmental harm compared to traditional alternatives. In this study, we examine the relevance of pollution haven effects—i.e., shifts of production toward countries with less stringent environmental standards—in firms’ global sourcing strategies for green products. Given the importance of credible and sustainable manufacturing practices in firms’ global value chains for green products, we expect that country environmental standards shape global sourcing decisions for green versus non-green products differently. Our findings using data on global imports and exports for more than 5000 distinct products over the 2002–2019 period show that green products are more likely to be sourced from countries with higher environmental stringency, whereas non-green product sourcing patterns align with prior research, which emphasizes the appeal of lower environmental standards and cost-efficiency. This green sourcing effect is stronger for consumer-facing products and for sourcing into countries where consumer engagement in environmentalism is higher and non-governmental organizations are more active. Unlike prior research that implies that higher environmental standards hurt exporters, our results suggest that such standards can benefit green product exporters.</content>

    <title>Sustainability Cues Can Delay Consumption</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rise of environmental concerns in recent decades, many companies have joined the initiative to advertise and promote sustainable consumption. The current research examines how providing sustainability cues to consumers might have unintended consequences of which practitioners and policymakers may not be fully aware. One pilot study and ten main studies, including two real-choice studies, show that a sustainability cue may delay consumption. That is, in an intertemporal choice, a sustainability cue can increase preference for a larger-later option over a smaller-sooner option. This effect occurs because a sustainability cue shifts a consumer’s temporal focus toward the future, leading to a shorter perceived wait time for the larger-later option. The findings further show that the delay does not emerge among those with strong green consumption values and can be circumvented if firms communicate the immediate need or instant payoff of sustainable actions. By investigating how sustainability cues shift consumer preferences between two options separated in time, the current research contributes to the literature on both sustainable consumption and intertemporal choice. The findings offer practitioners and policymakers guidelines to nudge consumers’ sustainable consumption more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model populism as the dissemination of a false “alternative reality,” according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism. (JEL D72, D82, D83)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that predictable uninformed cash flows forecast aggregate market stock returns. Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9. These results suggest price pressure is a widespread result of flows, not an anomaly. (JEL G12, G14, G35)</content>

    <title>Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This “offset” policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A nested bundling strategy creates menus in which more expensive bundles include all the goods of less expensive ones. We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles. (JEL D11, D21, D42, D82, M31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-term effect of public R&amp;D on growth in manufacturing by analyzing new data from the Cold War–era space race. We develop a novel empirical strategy that leverages US-Soviet rivalry in space technology to isolate windfall R&amp;D spending. Our results demonstrate that public R&amp;D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors. While migration responses were important, they were not sufficient to generate a wedge between local and national effects. The iconic moonshot R&amp;D program had only modest economic effects for both the local and national space-related sectors. (JEL E22, H54, L60, N12, N42, N62, O47)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Supplemental Security Income program uses a birth weight cutoff at 1,200 grams to determine eligibility. Using birth certificates linked to administrative records, we find low-income families of infants born just below the cutoff receive higher monthly cash benefits (equal to 27 percent of family income) at ages 0–2 with smaller benefits continuing through age 10. Yet we detect no improvements in health care use and mortality in infancy, nor in health and human capital outcomes as observed through young adulthood for these infants. We also find no improvements for their older siblings. (JEL I12, I13, I18, I38, J13, J14, J31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment to quantify the impact of the lifting of the Saudi women's driving ban on women's employment by randomizing rationed spaces in driver's training. Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women. The results underscore the importance of intrahousehold responses that can counteract legal gains in women's freedoms. (JEL C93, D13, J16, J22, K38, O15, O17)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many US colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that “society” dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its “disagreement cost.” We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2. (JEL D31, H24, H31, J22, J31, J62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).

    <title>Moving toward consensus: an examination of trends in investment fair values</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A primary argument against fair value measurement is the lack of verifiability, where verifiability is defined as consensus in measurement by independent parties. We evaluate this argument by investigating trends in the consensus of reported fair values. Our findings indicate that consensus increased between 2005 and 2019, as evidenced by reductions in the fair value range and standard deviation. Further analyses suggest that enhanced data availability—driven by public dissemination of trade information—serves as a mechanism for this trend. We also document that securities subject to testing by larger external auditors with more resources to take advantage of enhanced data availability are associated with a stronger trend in increasing consensus. Finally, this trend appears to be stronger in situations when management has a heightened opportunity to record a biased estimate. While conventional arguments express concern over management’s ability to manipulate fair values, our results demonstrate patterns consistent with improved verifiability.</content>

    <title>Single paper meta‐analysis is unavoidable</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advocate that the multiple studies of a common phenomenon that are featured in a typical behavioral research paper be jointly analyzed to provide a statistical summary of the set of studies as a whole. Indeed, we view such single paper meta‐analysis as unavoidable in typical behavioral research papers because (i) such papers feature multiple studies of a common phenomenon, (ii) such papers contain summaries of those studies, and (iii) statistical summaries of studies (i.e., meta‐analyses) are superior to non‐statistical summaries of them. Nonetheless, the current dominant practice is for such papers to feature separate statistical analyses of the data from each of the studies but to contain a non‐statistical summary of the multiple studies rather than a statistical summary. We believe that this is regrettable and therefore aim to rectify matters. Consequently, we review some considerations about meta‐analysis and statistical analysis more broadly; compare single paper meta‐analysis to traditional meta‐analysis and illustrate its benefits via a case study; discuss and dismiss concern about single paper meta‐analysis; and discuss single paper meta‐analysis and the review process.</content>

    <title>A General-Purpose IT Intervention to Improve Human Decision Making, Strengthen Passwords, and Reduce Receptivity to Misinformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <title>Executive Pay Cuts and Executive Turnover</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of executive pay cuts on executive turnover. While previous research has largely focused on the drivers of pay increases of top management team (TMT) members or the effects of their relative pay standing on executive behavior, the prevalence and consequences of pay cuts have received limited attention. Drawing on temporal comparison theory, I argue that executive pay cuts are positively associated with executive turnover. I then propose that the impact of pay cuts on executive turnover depends on contextual cues that influence how executives interpret these cuts. Specifically, I argue that the effect is stronger for salary cuts than for pay‐for‐performance (PFP) cuts. I also argue that the impact of a pay cut is stronger when an executive is paid below the TMT pay level and when few other TMT members experience similar cuts. I test these predictions on a large longitudinal sample of U.S. firms and find empirical support. These results highlight the importance of temporal comparisons in executive pay evaluation processes.</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <title>A tale of two biases: Unpacking the relationship of overestimation and overprecision on firm performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

We use decision trees to endogenously group similar stocks together by selecting optimal portfolio splits to span the stochastic discount factor, projected on individual stocks. Our portfolios are interpretable and well diversified, reflecting many characteristics and their interactions. Compared to combinations of dozens (even hundreds) of single/double sorts, as well as machine‐learning prediction‐based portfolios, our cross‐sections are low‐dimensional yet have up to three times higher out‐of‐sample Sharpe ratios and alphas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research documents the role of the misalignment of practice elements in practice habituation and change. We extend this literature by demonstrating the understudied role of practice relationality. Locating our empirical work in veganism, a context that encompasses a bundle of interrelated practices, we show how people who adopt veganism manage the relationality of their food-related practices (e.g., eating, cooking, and shopping for food) during shared moments. Building on interview, secondary, and netnographic data on people who pursue veganism, we demonstrate that changes in shared practice performances cause relational fractures. We pinpoint relational fractures that hinder practitioners from smoothly performing shared practices in three contexts: co-performance, co-learning, and the marketplace. To repair practice relationality, vegan consumers enact four relational competences, which we identify as decoding, decoupling, divesting, and chameleoning. These competences can repair some relational fractures while aggravating others. When vegan consumers fail to acquire any competence, however, they end up reverting to their old omnivorous performances. Our paper contributes to practice theory by conceptualizing the role of practice relationality in practices, introducing the concept of relational competence as a necessary element for performance (re)rehabituation, and demonstrating the role of practice intelligibility in the co-performance of shared practices.</content>

    <title>Concealing Prices: How Delayed Price Disclosure Influences Consumer Purchase Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article presents the first systematic empirical investigation into a longstanding question in retail: Is it better to display prices upfront or reveal them later in the purchase process? Two large-scale field studies demonstrate that delayed price disclosure can either increase or decrease sales. Supporting lab studies reveal that one plausible explanation is that a price delay allows price beliefs to shift consumers’ internal reference prices upward or downward, creating either positive or negative price expectation disconfirmations when prices are revealed. When consumers anticipate prices should be expensive (e.g., from premium brands or upscale stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations upward, making purchases more likely when prices are revealed. Conversely, when consumers anticipate prices should be inexpensive (e.g., sales events or discount stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations downward, making purchases less likely when prices are revealed. Our findings offer retailers actionable insights on when to reveal prices to customers. In doing so, the authors contribute to the literature on price obfuscation and challenge the conventional wisdom that shopping experiences should always minimize friction. (184 words)</content>

    <title>Strategic (Inconsistent) Disclosures and Sophisticated Investors: Evidence from Hedge Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent SEC regulations require that qualified hedge fund advisers provide their investors with narrative disclosures of their business and operations. We find that 40% of these disclosures omit or de‐emphasize information regarding advisers' operational and investment risks when compared to other sources of public information. Funds with such “inconsistencies” are associated with predictably lower fund performance but do not differ in their fund flows, flow‐performance relation, ownership structure, or management fees. These results are consistent with investors being subject to limited strategic thinking, which prevents them from fully unraveling the implications of strategic omissions. This, in turn, contributes to advisers' successful use of discretion to de‐emphasize information with adverse performance implications. Our findings suggest that information processing frictions can facilitate nondisclosure, even in markets with sophisticated investors.</content>

    <title>Is Prevention Better Than Cure? Effects of Cyber Risk Disclosures on Shareholder Response to Breaches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As digitalization increases firms’ exposure to cyber risks, corporate disclosures about how these risks are managed are becoming more common and influential. This study examines 1,912 breach incidents affecting public companies to understand how shareholder reactions differ depending on the type of cyber risk strategies disclosed. We find that, although breaches generally lead to stock price declines, firms that previously disclosed preventive strategies, such as efforts to avoid breaches, experience significantly smaller losses in market value. Conversely, disclosing mitigative strategies, focused on damage control after a breach, amplifies the negative impact. These effects arise from shareholders’ loss aversion: They respond more favorably to firms perceived as trying to prevent harm rather than simply reacting to it. These findings suggest that managers should focus cyber risk disclosures on credible, prevention-oriented strategies to build investor confidence and minimize financial fallout after a breach. Additionally, our findings advise against using cyber risk disclosures as tools for impression management. Managers should ensure these disclosures accurately reflect the firm’s cyber risk management practices, as failing to do so can undermine the economic benefits of emphasizing preventive strategies.</content>

    <title>Transforming Recruitment and Selection Practices in Organizations Through Discriminative and Generative &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Adoption: A Structuration Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically impacted human decision‐making, productivity, and human agentic role delivery, thereby transforming HRM practices, particularly in recruitment and selection. Traditional recruitment and selection methods involve the dynamic interplay of structure and human agents. This interplay is changing with the emergence of human‐technology‐conjoined agencies that share task delivery and role performance responsibilities, thereby altering and creating new recruitment and selection routines. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 43 HR and talent acquisition leaders in a high‐growth emerging market context to understand the transformational role of discriminative and generative AI technology agencies in changing recruitment and selection practices. This study contributes to existing HRM literature by demonstrating the impact of discriminative and generative AI in recruitment and selection and the simultaneous human‐AI collaboration and algorithmic management of humans emerging as a consequence. Furthermore, we theorize the transformational changes in structures and processes across the entire recruitment and selection process emerging from conjoined agencies.</content>

    <title>Ecosystem synergies as drivers of acquisitions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the structure of ecosystems shapes firms’ acquisition choices. We develop a theoretical framework comprising three levels of ecosystem structure – local interdependence, clusters, and centrality – that could drive choices of M&amp;A targets based on expected ecosystem synergies, a previously undocumented acquisition synergy that creates benefits for the acquirer and the ecosystem overall. Ecosystem synergy is value created through combination of the acquirer and target's ecosystem positions that improves the combined firm's alignment with third‐party complementors. Such synergies manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of the firms’ components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. In the setting of the e‐commerce technology industry, our results show that firms acquire targets to increase local interdependence of their components and their presence in component clusters.Managerial SummaryInnovation ecosystems are critical for firms’ performance. While prior research has established the importance of ecosystems and firms’ positioning within ecosystems, we do not actually know whether and how ecosystem structure shapes firms’ acquisition choices. In this article, we show that M&amp;A targets are not chosen solely for the value created by the acquirer or target, but also for their broader ecosystem synergies. Ecosystem synergies are a previously undocumented acquisition synergy (distinct from internal synergies and market power) that manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of firms’ post‐acquisition components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. We test our theory by mapping the ecosystem structure of 6187 technological components that drives 186 acquisitions in the e‐commerce technology sector during the period 2013 to 2021.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize optimal mutual fund risk-taking strategies in competitive multi-period tournaments among multiple players. With multiple competitors, every player begins by taking maximum risk. In the final period, all players continue to take maximum risk except the leading player, who employs a “lock-in” strategy that depends on the magnitude of the lead. Our theory predicts the leader should strategically lock in advantage by reducing risk-taking if and only if the lead is great enough, rather than an increase in risk-taking by the trailers to try to catch up. Empirical evidence from style-adjusted mutual fund tournaments provides strong and robust support.</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Management in Limbo: Task‐Driven Interweaving of Hierarchy and Market Management</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing use of algorithmic management (AM) in human resource (HR) activities has attracted growing attention from HR scholars, as organizations increasingly rely on digital labor platforms to leverage external workers. This study examines how these platforms apply AM in human resource management (HRM) and how these algorithmic systems embed both market and hierarchy management principles for shaping worker control and autonomy. Specifically, we seek to examine how AM manifests in two distinct ways across these platforms: one involving hierarchy and control, and another involving matching and autonomy. Using an inductive qualitative design, we analyzed 33 semi‐structured interviews with platform workers and documentary data from 23 digital labor platforms. Whereas prior research often frames AM in binary terms—that is, market/autonomy versus hierarchy/control—we explore how task characteristics influence the joint application of both market and hierarchy principles in AM for HRM activities of digital labor platforms. Our findings show how platforms dynamically calibrate market and hierarchy approaches to AM in response to task demands, balancing flexibility, oversight, discretion, and incentives. For HR scholars, this study highlights the flexible and conditional nature of AM systems that blend autonomy and control in nuanced ways. By moving beyond the dominant autonomy‐versus‐control dichotomy, we show how AM is configured to align with diverse forms of work across platforms, enhancing efficiency while sustaining worker engagement amid evolving task demands.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how a domestic venture capital (VC) firm’s syndication experience with reputable foreign VC firms improves its likelihood of achieving successful exits for entrepreneurial firms that it subsequently funds. We identify two complementary theoretical mechanisms: (a) domestic VC firms can gain certification from reputable foreign VC firms that improves access to superior investment opportunities and (b) they can learn from reputable foreign VC firms to better select and nurture ventures. Furthermore, the positive impact of syndication experience is particularly pronounced in facilitating exits for portfolio companies in foreign countries. Our findings highlight the enduring benefits that domestic VC firms gain from partnerships with reputable foreign VC firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users are recognized as a vital source of innovation and entrepreneurship, transitioning from passive consumers to active creators. This shift has significantly impacted the entrepreneurial landscape, prompting multidisciplinary research. Using bibliometric and thematic coding, our study critically analyzes 179 articles published over a 25-year period. Our review presents a theoretical analysis and an integrative conceptual framework comprising eight inductively generated topics nested within three clusters, representing distinctive motivations, processes, and outcomes of user entrepreneurship. Our study also maps the theoretical foundations that have shaped the field, highlighting both dominant perspectives and opportunities for further theoretical development. By clarifying the distinctiveness of user entrepreneurship, our review advances theoretical understanding and provides a structured agenda for future knowledge accumulation.</content>

    <title>Star Advantage: Employee Value Creation and Capture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into knowledge work is fundamentally reshaping employee performance and value creation in ways that challenge conventional wisdom. Rather than performance disparities being reduced through AI adoption, we argue that they may increase as star employees leverage superior domain expertise and strategic AI deployment to widen performance gaps—a phenomenon we term the “AI‐specific Matthew Effect.” These performance transformations coincide with dramatic shifts in value appropriation dynamics: Personal AI tools will enhance employee bargaining power by enabling portable, high‐value outputs independent of organizational resources, whereas enterprise AI systems serve as novel isolating mechanisms that strengthen firm value capture. These developments necessitate a theoretical reconceptualization of strategic human capital frameworks. Accordingly, we introduce the AI‐specific Matthew Effect to explain how AI may intensify performance stratification, modeling how AI reconfigures value creation and capture between employees and firms, and extending foundational human capital theories to account for human–AI complementarity. Our integrative theoretical framework offers critical guidance for navigating this transformation, helping organizations balance productivity gains with workforce equity in an uncertain era of interdependent human and artificial intelligence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thriving at work is a psychological state defined by dual experiences of vitality and learning. Existing research suggests that HRM practices can play a pivotal role in fostering employee thriving. In this perspective paper, we review the current literature on the relationship between HRM practices and employee thriving through five broad conceptual frameworks: (1) high‐performance HRM systems, (2) development‐oriented HRM, (3) purposeful and responsible HRM, (4) relational and inclusive HRM, and (5) multilevel contextual HRM. Beyond this review, we propose four key avenues for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of how HRM practices contribute to employee thriving. These research directions seek to explore the underlying mechanisms, contexts, and conditions that influence the effectiveness of HRM practices in promoting thriving, with a particular focus on sustaining employee thriving over time. Through these insights, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how HRM can be strategically designed and implemented to support sustainable and regenerative thriving in dynamic work environments.</content>

    <title>The extent and drivers of internal agglomeration of U.S. multi‐unit firms</title>
    <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the extent and determinants of internal agglomeration—the spatial clustering of establishments within firms. It introduces a novel methodology that benchmarks a firm's spatial footprint against that of comparable stand‐alone firms, yielding a firm‐level measure of internal agglomeration. Applied across sectors of the U.S. economy, the approach reveals that internal agglomeration is widespread but varies by industry and firm characteristics. It is more prevalent in service, non‐tradable, and labor‐intensive industries, and is especially pronounced among diversified firms. Among potential drivers, labor similarity consistently predicts intra‐firm colocation, while input–output and knowledge linkages are less influential. These findings bring a spatial lens to corporate strategy, showing that when key resources—particularly labor—face geographic frictions, colocating related activities enhances opportunities for sharing and redeployment.Managerial SummaryMany firms are known to colocate or cluster with other firms in related industries to reap the benefits of sharing specialized inputs, labor, and knowledge. We study whether multi‐unit firms can generate similar benefits by colocating their establishments. We examine the geographic distribution of establishments of multi‐unit firms using comprehensive data on the U.S. economy. We find that over half of all firms colocate their establishments significantly more than would be expected if these belonged to independent firms. Firms are especially likely to colocate establishments with similar labor requirements, which suggests a deliberate strategy to leverage internal labor synergies. Our findings suggest that managers should consider the potential benefits of internal resource sharing when selecting locations, particularly to capitalize on synergies from resources that are less geographically mobile.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates sample selection bias in early-stage investment. We use comprehensive administrative data on the universe of new firm starts in Norway, allowing us to compare venture-backed firms with ex ante similar firms that do not receive venture funding. The valuation premium for venture backing is sizeable at firm birth and doubles over the first 5 years, implying a substantial upward bias in venture capital (VC) returns relative to comparable firms. In contrast, the premium for firms receiving multiple rounds of outside equity emerges only after the first year and remains significantly smaller than the VC premium throughout the firm life cycle.</content>

    <title>Digital Development: Reimagining Research Beyond ICT4D</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions: digital in development (institutional use), digital for development (conscious design for outcomes), and development in a digital world (digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and why do producers change the categorization of their offerings? Prior categorization research assumes that producers engage in ongoing efforts to proactively optimize their categorical positioning, but this assumption may not hold for many producers due to their limited attentional capacity. Our theoretical account instead highlights the role of expectation violation cues—salient pieces of information indicating a violation of audience expectations—as triggers that can lead producers to revise their category choice. Our longitudinal study of 84,667 Airbnb hosts' categorization choices finds that negative customer reviews—an important form of expectation violation cue—significantly increase the likelihood of category‐switching, particularly in categories with heterogeneous expectations. Our study suggests that many producers might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.Managerial SummaryHow businesses categorize their products and services influences their commercial success; yet, there exists very limited understanding of when, why, and how businesses revise their category choices. Our study, which tracked the category choices of over 80,000 Airbnb hosts over time, reveals that Airbnb hosts most commonly switch categories after receiving negative customer reviews, particularly when a review indicates that the accommodation did not meet customer expectations and if the previously chosen category lacks a clearly defined set of expected features. When switching categories, hosts tend to choose categories that are relatively similar to their prior choices and that seem to accommodate a wide variety of offerings. These patterns suggest that many businesses might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.</content>

Through historical analysis of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we demonstrate how these codes shape strategic categorization and competitive dynamics. We show that firms can exploit ambiguous interaction codes to access advantageous decision makers and organizational routines, circumventing entrenched competitors. Further, firms can institutionalize preferred interaction codes through product design, reshaping category prototypes and market dynamics. However, overcommitment to specific interaction codes creates competitive vulnerabilities when market conditions shift. By developing an “inhabited” view of categories that emphasizes socially embedded practices, this study reveals how market categories are enacted through interactions and offers new insights into category‐based competition.Managerial SummaryThis study introducescategory interaction codes—expectations about where, when, how and by whom products are evaluated, used, and purchased within a market. Using the case of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we show that companies can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging and reconfiguringcategory interaction codes. For example, Wang Laboratories sidestepped direct competition with IBM by categorizing its products for engineers and department managers rather than MIS executives, and outperformed IBM in word processing by innovating how actors interact with the new category. For managers, the key insight is that success depends not only on product features but also on how your product fits into the daily decisions, roles, and behaviors that define a category.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the influence of CEO characteristics on M&amp;A decisions has long spurred researchers’ interest, little attention has been devoted to the ramifications of CEO integrity—the adherence to generally accepted norms and standards. We investigate how CEO integrity influences different stages of the M&amp;A decision process. Specifically, we argue that while CEO integrity reduces self‐serving behavior, it may also become a golden cage that constrains CEOs’ latitude of action. Accordingly, we find that CEO integrity decreases the probability of Type I errors (errors of commission) but increases the probability of Type II errors (errors of omission) in M&amp;A decision‐making. We contribute to theory development by putting forward CEO integrity as an important personality construct for upper echelons research to build on and extend further.Managerial SummaryThis paper examines how CEO integrity influences M&amp;A decision‐making, providing key insights for corporate strategy. Analyzing data from S&amp;P 1500 firms (2006‐2021), we find that CEOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in frequent or large‐scale M&amp;As, particularly avoiding cross‐border deals due to higher uncertainty and potential risks. High‐integrity CEOs also tend to pay lower acquisition premiums and take longer to complete deals, reflecting a cautious and thorough approach. While CEO integrity helps protect firms from costly mistakes it may also lead to missed growth opportunities, indicating a trade‐off between stakeholder considerations and strategic risk‐taking. Boards may need to tailor governance frameworks to optimize the balance between the benefits and constraints of CEO integrity.</content>

    <title>Inheriting Versus Developing Data Analytic Tests and Auditors’ Professional Skepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the use of audit data analytic tests (ADA) becomes increasingly established in practice, auditors will often confront situations in which they inherit ADA developed by others, as opposed to developing the ADA themselves. Despite the potential benefits of ADA, inheriting ADA could decrease auditors’ skeptical actions by diminishing their psychological ownership of the ADA. In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA. Evidence from mediation analyses suggests that these effects are driven by decreased psychological ownership when auditors inherit the ADA.</content>

    <title>Listen Closely: Measuring Vocal Tone in Corporate Disclosures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the usefulness of machine learning approaches for measuring vocal tone in corporate disclosures. We document a substantial mismatch between the widely adopted actor‐based training data underlying these approaches and speech in corporate disclosures. We find that existing models achieve near‐perfect vocal tone classification within their training domain. However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance. Our findings emphasize the importance of a domain‐specific approach to voice analysis in accounting and finance.</content>

    <title>Rethinking Indigenous Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous Entrepreneurship has been conceptualized as arising from and reflecting cultural characteristics common to Indigenous people internationally, yet this approach increasingly fails to capture its diversity. Drawing on a database of 19,530 Indigenous enterprises in Australia, we show that criterial approaches to defining Indigenous Entrepreneurship based on preconceived ideas about Indigenous ways of doing business do not adequately characterize Indigenous entrepreneurial activity. We propose an approach that analyses Indigenous entrepreneurialism as a strategic response to the challenges and opportunities encountered by Indigenous entrepreneurs, shifting the focus of study fromexpressions of indigeneity in entrepreneurship, toentrepreneurial responses to Indigenous contexts.</content>
