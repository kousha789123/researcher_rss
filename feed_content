    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We first document that, despite potential legal issues, overlapping directors are surprisingly prevalent among direct competitors. Using panel data regressions and plausibly exogenous shocks, we find that competing firms in markets with dense overlapping-director networks experience innovation herding, lose product differentiation, and, ultimately, perform poorly. Novel text-based network propagation tests of technologies show that intellectual property leakage plays a role as firms with dense overlapping director networks experience faster propagation of technologies to competitors. Our findings suggest a coordination problem where industry participants cannot stop rivals from earning small gains from leakage despite much larger industry-wide negative externalities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should the seller display all available products in a setting with multiple products or only offer a subset? Is there a benefit of withholding some products? The seller does not want to display low-margin products due to cannibalization, but what if all products have the same margin? In “Performance of the Offer-Everything Policy,” W. T. Huh, J. Paat, and M. Queyranne argue that in an environment where the seller cannot adjust assortment based on customer types, it is best to offer all available products in an environment. The analysis is based on competitive ratio and expected revenue. This research assures that a common practice of truthfully revealing product availability is a generally good policy to follow.</content>

    <title>Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although experimental design often focuses on selecting the single best alternative from a finite set, many pure-exploration problems pursue richer goals. Given a specific goal, adaptive experimentation aims to achieve it by strategically allocating sampling effort, with the underlying sample complexity characterized by a maximin optimization problem. In "Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration," Qin and You introduce a unified dual-directed framework for efficiently solving general pure-exploration problems, yielding a unified algorithm design principle that extends the top-two approach beyond best-arm identification. Their theoretical analysis proves asymptotic optimality for classical problems, such as Gaussian best-arm identification, thresholding bandits, and epsilon-best-arm identification. Extensive numerical experiments confirm these theoretical insights, showcasing significant improvements over existing methods. This dual-directed framework offers researchers and practitioners a powerful and versatile tool to navigate uncertainty and optimize exploration strategies effectively.</content>

    <title>A Separation of Utility and Beliefs Through Betting Consistency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For standard preferences under uncertainty, minimal requirements are proposed to identify cardinal utility and subjective, potentially nonadditive, beliefs. This is achieved through an application of betting consistency. This preference principle says that outcome midpoints derived from preferences over bets on an event are also midpoints when elicited from bets on a different event. This consistency requirement provides a simplified elicitation tool, while it also serves as a robustness test for utility measurements. An analyst can use betting consistency to identify a client’s cardinal utility index independent of the client’s beliefs. This follows from our simplified foundation for the biseparable utility model, the widely adopted framework for empirical measurements of utility under various sources of uncertainty. As a theoretical tool, betting consistency can be adopted to provide simple and intuitive foundations for new and for existing decision theories. For instance, an event-dependent version of betting consistency, if it is supplemented with Savage’s sure-thing principle or a version of that principle restricted to acts that satisfy Schmeidler’s comonotonicity property, delivers subjective expected utility or Choquet expected utility, as desired. We also demonstrate how models with specific nonadditive beliefs can easily be derived through bespoke formulations of betting consistency.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>Tending to the Particular: Navigating Tensions Around Principles of Alternativity Through an Ethics of Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alternative organizations must continuously address conflicts that emerge regarding diverging prioritizations and interpretations of autonomy, solidarity, and responsibility. We explore how tensions around alternative moral principles can be navigated through relational processes that attune to others' needs, emotions, and concerns. Building on an organizational ethnography of a cooperative campaign agency, we mobilize ethics of care as a research lens to trace and analyse how relational activities that are infused by an ethical attention to particular others assist the organization in dealing with these tensions. Our findings show that three relational activities – inquiring, deliberating, and responding – constitute a “relational tension‐navigation circuit” that enables the alternative organization to evoke, map, and situatively settle tensions around alternative principles by embracing the vulnerability, plurality, and flourishing of others. We contribute to relational, ethical, and processual research in alternative organizing by showing how the particular and the general can be productively enfolded in alternative organizations. Furthermore, we conceptualize a broad, ethically and relationally grounded understanding of revisability that supports alternative organizations in finding targeted adaptations and provisional solutions to address conflicts and tensions.</content>

    <title>When do Firms with New CEOs Engage in M&amp;amp;A? Understanding the Timing of New CEOs' First M&amp;amp;A Announcements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New CEO appointments can create strategic uncertainty for stakeholders, potentially undermining the CEO's position. While the stakeholder uncertainty perspective suggests CEOs may act boldly to clarify their strategic intentions during early tenure, the CEO life cycle perspective proposes that CEOs avoid such moves during early tenure, as they still need to learn. This study integrates these views to examine whether and when new CEOs under high strategic uncertainty make bold strategic choices during early tenure. Focusing on first acquisitions – especially large and cross‐border deals – we argue that new CEOs have a higher hazard of announcing an acquisition under high strategic uncertainty, namely, outsider CEOs and those whose appointments were more negatively received. Leveraging the time CEOs spend in their role as a conceptual bridge between the two perspectives, we argue that the acquisition hazard under high strategic uncertainty increases over early tenure, as CEOs gather information and learn. Analysing 873 new US CEOs (2004–2020) with an extended Cox hazard model, we find a generally higher hazard of first acquisition announcements for outsider CEOs and those with more negative appointment reactions, especially for bolder deals. Evidence on time dependence is mixed, but more pronounced for outsider CEOs and large acquisitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose CTREND, a new trend factor for cryptocurrency returns, which aggregates price and volume information across different time horizons. Using data on more than 3,000 coins, we employ machine learning methods to exploit information from various technical indicators. The resulting signal reliably predicts cryptocurrency returns. The effect cannot be subsumed by known factors and remains robust across different subperiods, market states, and alternative research designs. Moreover, it survives the impact of transaction costs and persists in big and liquid coins. Finally, an asset pricing model that incorporates CTREND outperforms competing factor models, providing a superior explanation of cryptocurrency returns.</content>

    <title>The Role of Observed Punishment in Deterring the Spillover Effects of Corporate Misconduct Among Non‐Peers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates (1) whether misreporting by corporate executives impacts unethical decision‐making by non‐peers in unrelated reporting tasks, and (2) whether observing various forms of punishment for corporate misreporting deters this spillover effect. Specifically, we examine the deterrent effects of two common forms of punishment (fines or imprisonment) and a novel form of punishment (public shaming). Across two experiments, we find that participants are more likely to misreport performance when exposed to media reports about executives engaging in financial misreporting. This evidence is consistent with executive misreporting leading to unethical decision‐making among non‐peer observers. We also find that participant misreporting is reduced when the media reports the punishments levied against those executives. In further mediation tests, our findings suggest observed punishments for corporate misconduct can influence perceptions of injunctive norms and potentially mitigate spillover in unethical behavior.</content>

    <title>Signaling Quality to Consumers: The Role of Social Media Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly turning to social media marketing to boost product visibility and spread consumer-generated content, which often reveals valuable information about product quality. However, our research shows that this dual role can backfire; heavy spending on social media marketing may no longer help high-quality firms stand out. Instead of investing heavily to reach a broad audience, high-quality firms may do better by cutting back and focusing on targeted niche markets. Furthermore, as consumers become more capable of discerning product quality through social media content, low- and medium-quality firms benefit less from mimicking one another. This creates stronger incentives for lower-quality firms to mimic the high-quality firm, which increases consumer confusion and weakens the quality signal conveyed through investment in social media marketing. These findings help explain the variation in firms’ social media marketing strategies and offer practical guidance on allocating social media budgets more effectively.</content>

    <title>Gender Stereotypes and Entrepreneur Financing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I document a significant gender gap in entrepreneurs’ access to early-stage equity financing. Using unique administrative data on French startups, I show that this gap is particularly pronounced in male-dominated sectors. Controlling for a comprehensive set of entrepreneur and startup characteristics—including demographics, backgrounds, and motivations—accounts for 42% of the average gender gap. However, in male-dominated sectors, 80% of the gap remains unexplained. Growth-oriented female entrepreneurs rely more heavily on bank loans, substituting equity with debt. Finally, VC-backed female-founded startups outperform their male counterparts in male-dominated sectors. These findings suggest that context-dependent stereotypes influence equity financing decisions. (JEL G24, G41, J16, L26)</content>

    <title>Getting to the Core: Inflation Risks Within and Across Asset Classes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do real assets protect against inflation? Stocks’ core inflation betas are negative, while their energy betas are positive. Currencies, commodities, and real estate mostly hedge against energy inflation, but not core inflation. These hedging properties are reflected in the prices of inflation risks: only core inflation carries a negative risk premium, and its magnitude is consistent within and across asset classes, uniquely among macroeconomic risk factors. Energy inflation has become more procyclical and volatile since the 1990s, which helps explain the time-varying correlation between stock and bond returns. A two-sector New Keynesian asset pricing model accounts for these facts quantitatively. (JEL E31, G11, G12)</content>

    <title>Effectiveness of Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Chinese Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global shift from face-to-face instruction to online learning, posing new operational challenges for business schools, particularly in equipping students with quantitative skills essential for the labor market. Leveraging China's abrupt lockdown policies as a natural experiment, we examine the heterogeneous effects of online education on student academic performance. Using a panel dataset of 15,329 observations from 7,867 undergraduate students across nine Chinese universities over four semesters (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), we compare academic outcomes before and during the transition to online learning. We find that online education led to an average increase of 8–11 points in mathematics scores on a 100-point scale during the pandemic. Applying principal component analysis, we identify four key policy measures that capture lockdown stringency: Stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, public transportation suspension, and public information campaigns. Stricter stay-at-home orders issued by the government reduce the effectiveness of online learning; however, these negative effects are partially offset by increased parental supervision and reduced external distractions resulting from workplace closures and the suspension of public transportation. Further, online learning is more effective for reasoning-focused courses (e.g., mathematics) than interpretation-focused courses (e.g., English), and the academic benefits of face-to-face peer interactions diminish significantly in online settings relative to offline environments. Our findings offer actionable insights for managing educational delivery during operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of tailoring online curriculum design and support systems to course content and student mobility constraints.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Consistency in Service Delivery: Examining the Effect of Process Standardization on Hospital Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare services provided to patients with similar medical conditions are known to vary. Standardization of healthcare delivery is a relatively new, yet hotly debated approach to address clinical variations. Previous research on process standardization in health service delivery has focused on measuring adherence to established protocols available only for a limited set of medical conditions. We create an alternate construct that quantifies process standardization measured in terms of consistency in services rendered, and apply it in a healthcare context using detailed nonpublic inpatient discharge data from about 35 million inpatient stays at acute care hospitals in California between 2008-2016. We examine the impact of such process standardization on the cost, quality, and variation in quality of care delivered at the hospital, operating unit, and medical condition level. We find that process standardization is associated with reductions in cost per discharge, readmission rate and variation in readmission rates at the hospital level. We also find that the impact of process standardization varies across different operating units and medical conditions, providing cost and quality benefit in majority of cases. We further conduct post-hoc analysis on the degree of process standardization, finding that higher rates of capacity utilization and complexity of patient disease mix is associated with a lower process standardization, while increasing focus and process adherence is associated with an increase in process standardization.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Imperative vs. Linguistic Alignment: Organizations Use Language to Modify Environmental Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Analysis on how organizations and the environment interact starts with the common assumption that mutual understanding and agreement are beneficial for organizations. The process of building such an agreement and the consequences of agreement versus disagreement are an active research topic and one that calls for additional research. We add evidence to this debate by performing a replication of the initial findings on the costs of category spanning. We also introduce the concept of linguistic alignment, defined as the intersection of organizational self-description and environmental understanding of the organization. We specify a measurement strategy for linguistic alignment and test the implications of linguistic alignment of U.S. public firms and securities analysts over the last two decades with a novel embedding alignment technique. We find that firm values are reduced when spanning categories, but linguistic alignment is a better predictor of firm value. In addition to this direct effect, linguistic alignment reduces the value reduction of firms with a multi-industry presence. This means that organizations that can manage their self-presentation to achieve linguistic alignment with external audience analysts to obtain better evaluations.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Science Research Council [SICSS Research Grant] and the National Science Foundation Division of Social and Economic Sciences [Grant SES-1236931].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19341 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimization problems with discrete decisions are nonconvex and thus lack strong duality, which limits the usefulness of tools such as shadow prices. It was shown in Burer (2009) that mixed-binary quadratic programs can be written as completely positive programs, which are convex. We apply this perspective by writing unit commitment in power systems as a completely positive program and then using the dual copositive program and strong duality to design new pricing mechanisms. We show that the mechanisms are revenue-adequate and, under certain conditions, support a market equilibrium. To facilitate implementation, we also employ a cutting plane algorithm for solving copositive programs exactly, which we further speed up via a second-order cone programming approximation. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the potential benefits of the pricing mechanisms and algorithms.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00906 .</content>

    <title>The Unequal Diffusion of Honesty and Dishonesty in Workplace Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honest and dishonest behaviors may both diffuse among the members of an organization. Knowing which of the two spreads faster is important because it impacts the extent to which managers will need to resort to other, potentially more costly solutions to curb dishonest behavior. Assessing empirically which of honest behavior or dishonest behavior spreads faster is challenging because this requires field measurements of social relationships and dishonest behavior of individual members, which poses both measurement and inference problems. We examine an original fine-grained data set from a large company that allows for identifying agents likely to be dishonest and interactions among employees while offering a natural experiment that circumvents the inference problems associated with identifying peer-to-peer diffusion. We find (1) that dishonest behavior diffuses, whereas honest behavior does not; (2) that diffusion likely operates through spreading information about opportunities for collusion; and (3) that policies that screen on dishonesty at hiring may be efficient to curb dishonest behavior in environments with high turnover.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates why commercial lenders make markets for the loans that they sell on the secondary market. Using loan‐level data, I find that origination lenders with extensive borrower relationships and more reputational capital at stake are more likely to serve as market makers. Greater participation of origination lenders as market makers is associated with lower trading costs for their borrowers' loans. This association remains even in conditions where origination lenders could exploit their information advantage for market making profits. Lenders benefit from being market makers by maintaining strong subsequent lending relationships with their borrowers. Collectively, this evidence is consistent with origination lenders' participation in the secondary market being motivated by reducing trading frictions rather than market making profits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an era of escalating disruptions—from pandemics to economic crises—organizational resilience is vital for survival and growth. This study offers actionable insights for business leaders and policymakers on strategically leveraging information technology (IT) resources and leadership structures to navigate major shocks. We demonstrate that although diverse IT portfolios (e.g., cloud systems, data analytics tools) can enhance resilience by enabling adaptability, balance is key: moderate IT diversity strengthens resilience, but excessive diversity creates coordination complexities that erode it. Crucially, empowering IT leaders with formal decision-making authority helps firms maximize IT flexibility, shifting this tipping point to harness greater IT diversity without compromising coordination. Our analysis of firms during the pandemic reveals that crisis-induced industry turbulence further shapes these dynamics. Adverse turbulence intensifies the risks of overdiversification, requiring tighter alignment between IT strategies and leadership oversight. Conversely, beneficial turbulence allows firms to experiment with IT resources more freely. Policymakers can support businesses by fostering digital infrastructure, incentivizing IT leadership training, and creating frameworks for public-private data sharing during emergencies. By aligning IT flexibility with coordinated execution, firms can turn crises into opportunities for sustained success. This research equips stakeholders with evidence-based strategies to future-proof operations in an unpredictable world.</content>

    <title>Pay and Train to Sustain: A Dynamic Human Capital Resources View of the Relationship Between &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Practices and Organizational Performance Over Time</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The relationship between human resource management (HRM) practices and organizational performance has received considerable attention in the literature. Most extant studies, however, have taken a static view, while longitudinal aspects of the HRM‐performance link are less studied. We develop an integrative framework drawing on human capital resources theory that enables us to develop hypotheses on whether and how increases in dimensions of HRM practices within organizations over time lead to improvements in organizational performance. We test our hypotheses using a unique large high‐frequency panel dataset from the English adult social care sector and fixed effects instrumental variables (FEIV) estimation that allows us to address some biases in prior work. We find that increases in skill‐enhancing and motivation‐enhancing HRM bundles are significantly associated with increases in performance among organizations with low initial human capital resources stock. Our results suggest that the latter relationship is realized partly via a reduction in staff turnover, which, in turn, increases the organization's human capital resources stock. Overall, the article's contribution is to develop and test a dynamic extension of human capital resources theory that considers the processes of human capital resources stock depletion and accumulation over time and the path‐dependent relationship between investments in HRM practices and performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory offers conflicting predictions on how bank specialization affects corporate innovation. We show that the sign and magnitude of this effect vary with the degree of “asset overhang” across sectors—the risk that new technologies reduce the value of banks’ legacy loan portfolios. Using Belgian innovation survey data and U.S. patent data, we find that lenders’ sectoral specialization enhances innovation for firms operating in sectors with low asset overhang, but hinders innovation in sectors with high asset overhang. These findings are robust to different measures of asset overhang and an identification strategy using bank mergers. We further show that these heterogeneous effects arise through financial contracting. Our findings highlight how product market characteristics shape the role of bank specialization in innovation.</content>

    <title>Rent Extraction Amid Borrowers’ Adversity: Evidence from Activist Short Sellers’ Attacks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Finance theory suggests that the privileged information that traditional banks obtain about borrowers through monitoring creates opportunities for banks to impose informational hold-up costs on such borrowers. Because a surge in borrower risk increases banks’ hold-up power, banks with information monopoly should be able to increase their rates beyond the level explained by borrower risk alone. We test this theory using the setting of activist short sellers’ public allegations—a setting that increases borrower risk and restricts borrower access to public financing sources—and find, on average, that, after controlling for both ex ante and ex post changes in borrower credit risk, banks increase loan pricing following activist short sellers’ allegations. Our loan pricing results not explained by changes in borrower credit risk are consistent with banks extorting borrowers during times of adversity.</content>

    <title>The effect of mortgage securitization on asset liquidation decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines whether agency conflicts introduced by securitization affect servicers’ asset liquidation decisions. We find securitized loans are 25.4% to 28.5% less likely to be liquidated via short sales than portfolio loans. Securitized loan servicers’ bias against short sales does not represent an agency conflict if short sale and real estate owned (REO) liquidations are equally efficient. However, we find REOs have significantly lower average liquidation prices, higher average liquidation expenses, and longer average liquidation times than short sales. Although short sales benefit investors, securitized loan servicers have a financial incentive to pursue REOs.</content>

    <title>Counterfactual Identification and Latent Space Enumeration in Discrete Outcome Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides a unified framework for studying the identification of counterfactual parameters in a general class of discrete outcome models, allowing for endogenous regressors and multidimenional latent variables, all without parametric distributional assumptions. Our main theoretical result is that, when the covariates are discrete, the infinite-dimensional latent variable distribution can be replaced with a finite-dimensional version that is equivalent from an identification perspective. The finite-dimensional latent variable distribution is constructed in practice by enumerating regions of the latent variable space with a new and efficient cell enumeration algorithm for hyperplane arrangements. We then show that bounds on a certain class of counterfactual parameters can be computed by solving a sequence of linear programming problems, and show how the researcher can introduce additional assumptions as constraints in the linear programs. Finally, we apply the method to a mobile phone choice example with heterogeneous choice sets, and to an airline entry game example.</content>

    <title>The Micro and Macro Effects of Changes in the Potential Benefit Duration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify micro and macro effects of changes in the potential benefit duration (PBD) in unemployment insurance. In Poland, the PBD is 12 months for the newly unemployed if the previous year’s county unemployment rate is more than 150% of the national average, and 6 months otherwise. We exploit this cut-off using regression discontinuity estimates on registry data containing the universe of unemployed from 2005 to 2019. For those whose PBD is directly affected by the policy rule, benefit recipients younger than 50, a PBD increase from 6 to 12 months leads to 13% higher unemployment. A decomposition analysis reveals that 12 months after an increase in the PBD, only half of the increase in unemployment is due to the effect on search effort (the micro effect) while the other half is due to increased inflows into unemployment. The total effect on unemployment, which includes equilibrium effects, is entirely explained by the increase in unemployment of workers directly affected by the policy change. We find no evidence of spill-overs on two distinct groups of unemployed whose PBD is unchanged and no effect on measures of labour market tightness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market participants have called on the SEC to address the lack of disclosures about firms’ environmental impacts, investments, and exposures. However, the frictions that obstruct the flow of environmental information are not well understood. I shed light on these frictions by examining whether scrutiny by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) restricts the firm’s voluntary environmental disclosures in earnings conference calls. Consistent with the notion that EPA scrutiny gives rise to disclosure frictions, I find a negative relation between EPA scrutiny and the environmental disclosures of scrutinized firms. This negative relation is concentrated among firms without environmental expert directors, suggesting that environmental governance mitigates the chilling effect of EPA scrutiny. In terms of disclosure quality, I show that environmental disclosures include fewer quantitative details under EPA scrutiny. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the frictions that restrict the flow of environmental information to market participants, an important issue given the SEC’s efforts to improve current disclosure practices.</content>

    <title>Manager characteristics and the informativeness of banks’ loan loss provisioning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of individual managers in banks’ financial reporting. We exploit the connectedness between different managers and find that individual bank managers explain approximately 19 percent of banks’ loan loss provisions. This observation is consistent with the substantial reporting discretion that individual bank managers use in the estimation of loan loss provisions and that is increasingly subject to financial stability concerns by prudential supervisors. Our results suggest that these concerns are valid, as individual management discretion is associated with greater discretionary loan loss provisions and proxies for opportunistic accounting, especially the reduction in the timeliness of these provisions and the lesser degree to which the allowance for credit losses maps into future charge-offs. These findings are relevant for the design of regulatory measures aimed at limiting the managerial influence on accounting choices in banking and can inform debates on the desirability of discretion within the reporting process of banks.</content>

    <title>Market Demand, Competition for Knowledge Workers, and Impact on Invention: Evidence from Electric Vehicle Technologies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy and innovation scholars have long emphasized the positive role of market demand in driving innovation within a technological domain. This study sheds light on an indirect negative spillover effect of market demand on technological progress: whereas increased downstream market demand within a domain generally drives increased technological progress in that domain (i.e., the demand-relevant domain), it may also adversely affect the technological progress of firms in adjacent domains. This occurs because the increased technological progress within the demand-relevant domain, driven by the downstream market demand, can intensify competition for skilled knowledge workers—a critical innovation resource whose supply is often inelastic in the short term. Empirically, I test these arguments by exploiting an unexpected environmental policy shock—the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate—which led to an exogenous increase in demand for electric vehicle (EV) technologies. Following the ZEV mandate, I find evidence of increased inventive activities in the EV domain by EV firms. However, firms in adjacent (non-EV) domains were more likely to lose knowledge workers to EV firms following the ZEV mandate. Consequently, these affected firms produced 22% fewer inventions, particularly in their core technological areas, and became 19% less likely to explore new technological areas. Notably, affected firms in growing technological domains, such as renewable energy, and smaller, younger firms were more adversely (or at least equally) impacted.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18181 .</content>

    <title>Spectral Ranking Inferences Based on General Multiway Comparisons</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ranking Inferences for General Multiway ComparisonsRanking inference underpins critical decision-making across diverse domains including e.g. university ranking, journal ranking, academic paper review, voting, online recommendation and tournament competition. Beyond generating point estimates of ranks, these applications also demand confidence intervals for ranks through robust uncertainty quantification, in order to ensure reliable and informed decisions. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on classical models such as Bradley-Terry-Luce and Plackett-Luce, which assume homogeneous comparison structures and prove inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents a unified spectral ranking methodology for heterogeneous multiway comparisons, which simultaneously achieves statistical efficiency under minimal structural assumptions and computational scalability. The authors establish comprehensive ranking inference tools, grounded in the asymptotic normality theory and bootstrapping techniques, facilitating top-K selection, rank confidence interval construction, and hypothesis testing for cross-population or cross-period ranking consistency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can models incorporating nontraditional, behavioral elements into the classical, expected-utility framework help explain seemingly dominated choice behavior of participants in centralized matching markets? Can they help in redesigning matching mechanisms to reduce such behavior? Investigating the widely used deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm, we answer positively, both in theory and using laboratory experiments. We use an off-the-shelf news-utility model where preferences include expectations-based reference dependence (EBRD): individuals care not only about actual consumption but also about news (relative to previously held expectations) regarding consumption. Each participant in our laboratory experiments (N = 500) plays 10 simulated large-market school-assignment problems of varying competitiveness, in one of four ([Formula: see text]) different DA variants. They vary by whether individuals submit their rankings prior to the matching process (a static implementation) or make sequential decisions (a dynamic implementation), and whether they are on the proposing or receiving side: [Formula: see text]static, dynamic[Formula: see text]student proposing, student receiving[Formula: see text]. Whereas a traditional, reference-independent model predicts the same straightforward behavior across all problems and variants, a news-utility EBRD model predicts stark differences across them. Intuitively, to avert losses from bad news, EBRD individuals may downrank, or even avoid applying to, competitive positions that, when offered to them (with certainty), they will accept. Consistent with our predictions, we find that (i) across DA variants, dynamic student receiving leads to significantly fewer deviations from straightforward behavior; (ii) across problems within the other three variants, deviations increase with problem competitiveness; and (iii) in those three variants, the specific deviations predicted by EBRD are indeed those commonly observed empirically. We discuss practical implications.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation [Grant 2022417], the Israel Science Foundation [Grants 1796/22 and 2968/21], the Maurice Falk Institute, and the Johnson School at Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05446 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first evidence on the long-run returns to private equity in emerging and frontier markets using the cash flows from every equity investment made by the International Finance Corporation across 130 countries over 58 years. Risk-adjusted returns are comparable to the S&amp;P 500, at least from 1961 until 2010. Returns improve with economic growth but decline as banking systems deepen and countries relax capital controls. These results are consistent with the thesis that financial frictions have prevented the flow of capital from rich to poor countries and that the persistence of impact investors’ performance may rely on identifying or creating new markets that lack access to capital.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Conflict of Interest Statement: Shawn Cole served five days as a “Short Term Consultant” to the IFC in 2018–19 and in a non-compensated advisory role for Y Analytics, a subsidiary of impact investor TPG/Rise.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We employ an identification strategy for retail participation to explore the link between return momentum and investing clientele. This scheme relies on strictly enforced round-lot rules in China, which financially constrain retail investors from participating in stocks with high nominal prices. We find that there is strong momentum in high-priced stocks but no momentum on aggregate. This result supports the idea that noise trades of retail investors mask momentum, whereas other more sophisticated investors contribute to momentum. We validate this notion by showing that retail investors with small (large) portfolios are less (more) prone to participating in stocks with high nominal prices. Further, small investor participation increases and momentum weakens following splits in high-priced stocks. Finally, we find that the positive relation between nominal prices and momentum extends to a considerable majority of international markets with round-lot rules.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Y.-J.

    <title>Managerial Efficiency and Reverse‐Flow Complexity in a Circular Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Circular Economy (CE) is a system in which products are collected after customers have used them, remanufactured, and then put back into circulation for further use. This reduces the need for virgin materials to manufacture new units and wastage from used units. However, it is well known that delays in inventory returns often lead managers to make suboptimal ordering decisions. This problem is particularly significant in CE systems, where inadequate inventory management can significantly reduce or even negate the benefits of CE. The existing literature lacks evidence on the magnitude of this issue and its key contributing factors. Addressing this gap is essential for developing operational details and maximizing the benefits of CE systems. Using a novel complexity ordering based on a formal characterization of the reverse flow of goods, we investigate the efficiency of managerial decision‐making. In our experimental study, participants made inventory replenishment decisions in various CE systems that differed in the complexity of reverse flow. We found that participants' operating costs were substantially higher than the simple benchmark costs, and as the CE system became more complex in reverse flow, the suboptimality of managerial decision‐making worsened. Our experimental results provide prescriptions and guidance for practitioners by identifying: (i) CE configurations for which managerial decision‐making tends to be better, and (ii) behavioral nudges to improve the efficiency of decision‐making.</content>

    <title>How Change Recipients Become Rivals: Legitimacy Dynamics and ‘Cooptive Rejection’ in Organizational Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study challenges a commonly held assumption in the legitimacy and organizational change literatures: that the legitimacy of a change project is closely tied to, and dependent upon, the legitimacy of the change agent promoting it. Drawing on an in‐depth, three‐and‐a‐half‐year qualitative study of a major transformation within a French public organization, we identify a surprising dynamic – instances where a change initiative gains support and is judged as legitimate even as the legitimacy of the change agent deteriorates. To explain this dissociation, we develop a theory ofcooptive rejection, a process through which change recipients appropriate and endorse the content of a change while actively distancing themselves from, or even undermining, its initiator. We unpack the mechanisms that enable this dissociation and highlight the crucial role of recipient agency. Our research contributes to legitimacy theory by revealing how multiple objects of legitimacy can evolve independently – and even in opposition – over time. We also advance organizational change scholarship by illuminating the competitive nature of transformation processes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify and estimate price informativeness, a necessary step in testing theories of information aggregation. Starting from a pricing equation and a stochastic process for payoffs, we show how to recover relative price informativeness from regressions of asset price changes on changes in payoffs. Applying our identification results, we estimate a panel of stock-specific measures of informativeness for U.S. stocks. In the cross-section, large stocks with high turnover, idiosyncratic volatility, institutional ownership, and analyst coverage have higher informativeness. In the time series, the median, mean, and standard deviation of the distribution of informativeness have steadily increased since the mid-1980s. (JEL G14, E44, D82)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The channels through which analyst research data are distributed are complex. The I/B/E/S database is the dominant source for analyst earnings estimates for academics, but there are numerous other channels, some of which are cost prohibitive for many investors. We describe the distribution of analyst research and examine whether a high-cost alternative distribution channel, TR Research, is characterized by higher quality estimates than those available from I/B/E/S. We examine analyst forecast accuracy, bias, and informativeness and find that TR Research estimates are more accurate and less biased than estimates exclusively distributed via I/B/E/S. We further find that TR Research estimates are associated with greater market reaction and lower information asymmetry, consistent with the higher quality of these estimates. Our study highlights differences in brokerage and analyst incentives regarding research distribution and documents a specific setting where a subset of investors pays for access to superior analyst research.</content>

    <title>Do key audit matter disclosures about M&amp;amp;A transactions predict future performance?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines whether auditor KAM disclosures about M&amp;A transactions predict future performance outcomes. We find that auditors make more M&amp;A KAM disclosures when M&amp;A transactions are larger, involve targets with greater information asymmetry, and are subject to greater overpayment risk. When auditors disclose M&amp;A KAMs in the acquisition year, we find an increased risk of larger goodwill impairments and that the association between acquired goodwill and changes in companies’ subsequent operating performance are significantly lower compared to when auditors do not issue an M&amp;A KAM. We also find that the likelihood of forced CEO turnover is incrementally higher when subsequent operating performance is poor and auditors issue an M&amp;A KAM compared to when they do not. Collectively, our findings suggest that these auditor disclosures reflect uncertainty that predicts weak post-acquisition performance and forced CEO turnover, incremental to other indicators of failed acquisition strategies.</content>

    <title>Is Your Price Personalized? Alleviating Customer Concerns with Inventory Availability Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can Customers Spot Price Discrimination?Firms adjust prices to match supply with demand and increasingly use customer data to personalize pricing. Consequently, customers have limited visibility into price drivers and may worry about price discrimination based on their shopping behavior. For instance, a customer with high willingness to pay may receive a high price either because the product is popular or because the price has been personalized. In “Is Your Price Personalized? Alleviating Customer Concerns with Inventory Availability Information,” A. Aflaki and Q. Zhang studied whether observed prices are sufficiently informative to signal personalization in a dynamic setting. They found that price alone cannot resolve this uncertainty, which may lead to actions that harm both firms and customers. However, a simple binary signal disclosing whether inventory is low or abundant can, under certain conditions, ease customer concerns and benefit both the firm and its customers.</content>

    <title>Angular Combining of Forecasts of Probability Distributions</title>
    <updated>2025-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When multiple forecasts are available for a probability distribution, forecast combining enables a pragmatic synthesis of the information to extract the wisdom of the crowd. The linear opinion pool has been widely used, whereby the combining is applied to the probabilities of the distributional forecasts. However, it has been argued that this will tend to deliver overdispersed distributions, prompting the combination to be applied instead to the quantiles of the distributional forecasts. Results from different applications are mixed, leaving it as an empirical question whether to combine probabilities or quantiles. In this paper, we present an alternative approach. Looking at the distributional forecasts, combining the probabilities can be viewed as vertical combining, with quantile combining seen as horizontal combining. Our proposal is to allow combining to take place on an angle between the extreme cases of vertical and horizontal combining. We term this angular combining. The angle is a parameter that can be optimized using a proper scoring rule. For implementation, we provide a pragmatic numerical approach and a simulation algorithm. Among our theoretical results, we show that, as with vertical and horizontal averaging, angular averaging results in a distribution with mean equal to the average of the means of the distributions that are being combined. We also show that angular averaging produces a distribution with lower variance than vertical averaging, and, under certain assumptions, greater variance than horizontal averaging. We provide empirical results for distributional forecasts of COVID mortality, macroeconomic survey data, and electricity prices.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05558 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing fraction of companies globally have made commitments to reduce their carbon emissions by a certain date. Whereas the companies that make commitments subsequently reduce their emissions, the effect on overall emissions of companies (including those that do not commit) has been small. The companies that commit and those that make the most ambitious commitments tend to have lower emissions; firm commitments are less prevalent in countries where governments have made national commitments. Overall, the commitment movements have been successful in drawing the willing but have found greater resistance from the companies that most need to reduce their emissions.This paper was accepted by Caroline Flammer, sustainability.Funding: This work was supported by Horizon Europe Climate, Energy and Mobility [Grant ERC-AG 885552] from the European Research Council (ERC) under the ERC Advanced Grant program “Investors and Climate Change.”Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07298 .</content>

    <title>Merit Pay Adoption and Labor Productivity in South Korean Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Merit pay is a compensation system that raises employees' base salaries, contingent on their prior performance. Despite its widespread use, the evidence regarding its impact on organizational performance remains inconclusive. In this research, we focus on the unique semi‐permanent and cumulative features of merit pay and draw on the compounding incentive effect and the collective sorting effect as complementary theoretic mechanisms to explain the organizational implications of merit pay adoption. Specifically, we argue that implementing merit pay is positively associated with labor productivity growth. Employing random coefficient growth modeling, we analyze a sample of 317 publicly listed firms in South Korea. Our findings reveal that although firms adopting merit pay did not exhibit higher labor productivity levels after 1 year (short‐term performance), they demonstrated significantly higher linear productivity growth over time following adoption (long‐term performance). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>Embodied Territories: The Gendered‐Classed Economies of Entrepreneurship in India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While women's entrepreneurship theory and practice have advanced significantly in the last few decades, the persistent challenges women entrepreneurs face suggest the need for novel theoretical insights that illuminate their experiences of entrepreneurship as an everyday, embodied practice. Drawing upon Sara Ahmed's critical interpretive phenomenological account of affective economies and based on qualitative accounts from 58 entrepreneurs in India, this paper explores how gendered‐classed experiences enable or constrain embodied practices of women entrepreneurs in the Global South. We make two key contributions to women's entrepreneurship literature within management studies. First, we show how gendered and classed experiences orientate entrepreneurs when navigating the possibilities and restrictions faced in everyday spaces of commerce. Second, we develop a theoretical understanding of the affective and situated negotiation of entrepreneurial work in situ through what we call the embodied territories of entrepreneurship. We discuss how ‘embodied territories’ provides an important counterpoint to cognition‐driven affect literature that dominates management research and advances the broader affective turn in management studies. Overall, this research presents an alternative way of understanding a hitherto overlooked perspective on how women embody, experience, and negotiate entrepreneurial spaces.</content>

    <title>Seeking Beauty and Finding Health: How Choosing Beautiful Food Promotes Healthy Eating</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers frequently perceive a tradeoff between health and taste, leading to poor dietary choices. This research identifies a novel pathway to healthier eating: seeking beauty in food. Across seven pre-registered field and lab studies, pursuing beautiful food systematically increased healthy choices without diminishing perceived taste. This effect arises because beauty is positively associated with both health and taste, effectively resolving the commonly perceived health-taste conflict. Individuals who sought beauty in food consistently selected healthier options across diverse consumption contexts—including cafeteria meals, self-generated food ideas, grocery lists, and varied menus (with and without images)—and across populations, spanning both adults and children. Notably, the effect was stronger among individuals who more strongly associate beauty with health, and weaker in choice sets where the beauty–health association was less pronounced (e.g., morning cereals). These findings advance motivation theory by positioning beauty as a goal in itself, rather than merely a perceptual cue. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications for consumer behavior, food marketing, and public policy initiatives aimed at promoting healthier eating habits.</content>

    <title>Building credible commitments via board ties: Evidence from the supply chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel dataset that provides a comprehensive coverage of U.S. firms' industrial supply chain relationships, we find that firms with innovation specific to a buyer are more likely to share a common director with that buyer. This association is stronger when the buyer has a larger number of alternative suppliers. We further find that when a supplier–buyer pair shares a common director, the supplier's R&amp;D investment is more sensitive to the investment opportunities of its buyer. Moreover, such pairs tend to have longer supply chain relationships. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that board ties serve as a credible commitment mechanism to support exchange along the supply chain and safeguard suppliers' buyer‐specific investments.Managerial SummaryOur research shows that suppliers who create products or technologies tailored to a specific buyer are more likely to share a board member with that buyer. This relationship is stronger when the buyer has many other suppliers. Shared board members facilitate better communication and alignment between suppliers and buyers, leading to more effective R&amp;D investments and longer‐lasting business relationships. These ties help reduce the risk for suppliers when investing in customized solutions. For business leaders, strategically leveraging board connections can strengthen supply chain partnerships, promote collaborative innovation, and safeguard investments in buyer‐specific technologies.</content>

    <title>Corporate development executives and M&amp;amp;A performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While prior research has examined organizational‐ and CEO‐level antecedents to mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) capabilities, less is known about how those below the CEO may shape the ways in which firms conduct acquisitions. In this study, I argue that Corporate Development Executives (CDEs), the specialized executives who lead M&amp;A efforts inside companies, also play an important role in the M&amp;A process. Through a hand‐collected dataset on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 information technology (IT) firms, I find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between their prior M&amp;A experience and subsequent M&amp;A performance, and I document the conditions under which CDEs' M&amp;A experience may complement or substitute that of the CEO and the firm. This study contributes to corporate strategy and organizational learning literatures by unveiling novel insights on the microfoundations of M&amp;A capabilities.Managerial SummaryCorporate Development Executives (CDEs) have become increasingly prevalent across organizations, yet their impact on M&amp;A outcomes remains less understood. This study investigates how these specialized executives responsible for leading M&amp;A inside organizations influence acquisition outcomes through their prior experience. Using detailed data on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 IT firms, I find an inverted‐U relationship between CDEs' prior M&amp;A experience and M&amp;A performance, and that their abilities to shape M&amp;A outcomes can be further enhanced or limited, depending on the experiences of the CEO and the firm. By unpacking the interactions among these different M&amp;A experiences, this work offers important managerial implications on how firms should select and manage their M&amp;A human capital as they continue to build M&amp;A capabilities in pursuit of superior firm performance.</content>

    <title>How We Can Help Working Moms “Win”: The Impact of Social Support During Pregnancy on Postpartum Working Mom Guilt</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using signaling theory, this research examines the role that social support during pregnancy plays in reducing work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave. Specifically, we consider four sources of social support (two from the work domain: supervisor and coworkers; and two from the non-work domain: spouse and friends) and the signaling effect they have on a mother’s work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave and her subsequent job and family satisfaction. Based on a sample of 247 women who completed surveys both before taking maternity leave and upon returning to the workforce, we found that supervisor, coworker, and friend support enhanced job satisfaction through reduced work-induced guilt. Further, both supervisor and spouse support contributed to family satisfaction through reduced family-induced guilt. Spouse support reduced family-induced guilt significantly more than coworker support, offering some modest support for domain specificity. Further, when considering the interaction of within-domain effects, we found that the work domain sources of support interact to provide a stronger effect on job satisfaction, but the non-work domain sources do not interact significantly. This provides an enlightening look at social support’s different roles in working mom guilt during a pivotal time in a woman’s life, her return to work after childbirth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market. (JEL G11, G12, G17)</content>

    <title>Capital Requirements with Non-Bank Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I quantitatively analyze the macroeconomic impacts of raising capital requirements in a model in which heterogeneous firms may choose either intermediated or direct finance. Heterogeneous banks compete with other banks and the bond market, fund loans with insured deposits and costly equity (subject to a minimum capital to asset ratio), and monitor borrowers. I find that tighter capital requirements reduce costly bank failures while having only small effects on key macroeconomic aggregates, and that raising capital requirements above current levels can be welfare-improving. Three main forces give rise to these results. First, even though banks cut loan supply for a given level of net worth under a tighter capital requirement, in equilibrium banks’ net worth rises to dampen this effect. Second, intense competition from the non-bank sector disciplines banks’ lending responses to tighter regulation. Third, substitution by corporate firms offsets much of the decline in debt financing associated with tighter bank loan supply. As a corollary, almost all of the modest costs associated with tighter capital requirements are concentrated within the bank-dependent non-corporate sector.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Introducing a new measure of scientific proximity between private firms and public research groups and exploiting a multi-billion euro financing program of academic clusters in France, we provide causal evidence of local spillovers from academic research to firms in the private sector. Our main estimate suggests that each euro spent in academic research through this program spurred an additional 0.81 euros in private R&amp;D expenditures. We also show that this shock increased the average quality of patents. We exploit reports produced by funded clusters, complemented by data on firm creation, labor mobility and R&amp;D public–private partnerships, to provide evidence on the channels for these spillovers. We discuss the policy implications of funding academic research to stimulate private R&amp;D.</content>

In “Hidden convexity in a class of optimization problems with bilinear terms,” Gorissen, den Hertog, and Reusken discover a reformulation technique that provides an equivalent convex formulation that is solvable in polynomial time for a rich subclass of problems. The subclass is characterized by products of variables where one variable is nonnegative and the other variable interacts only with variables that are multiplied with the same nonnegative variable. Their finding provides a new avenue to efficiently solve inverse optimization problems, nonlinear robust optimization problems via their dual problem, and problems with variable coefficients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how variations in nonfinancial terms across bonds from the same issuer, referred to as “issuer term variability” (ITV), relate to bond yield spreads, returns, and investor bases. Our findings show that ITV is positively associated with yield spreads, even after accounting for the issuer’s credit ratings and other credit risk proxies. Additionally, bonds with high ITV exhibit greater default risk but deliver lower risk-adjusted returns compared with those with low ITV. We also find that yield-seeking investors are more likely to own bonds with high ITV, and bond funds that reach for yield also tend to favor high ITV bonds. These results suggest that some investors specifically target high ITV bonds to achieve higher yields, even at the cost of lower returns. Further analysis indicates that reaching for ITV is difficult to justify as rational risk-taking by constrained investors.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01876 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of big data analytics has automated the decision-making of companies and increased supply chain agility. In this paper, we study the supply chain contract design problem faced by a data-driven supplier (she) who needs to respond to the inventory decisions of the downstream retailer (he). Both the supplier and the retailer are uncertain about the market demand and need to learn about it sequentially over a fixed time horizon. In addition, the supplier does not know the retailer’s inventory learning policy, which may change dynamically. The goal for the supplier is to develop data-driven pricing policies with sublinear regret bounds under a wide range of possible retailer inventory learning policies. To capture the dynamics induced by the retailer’s inventory learning policy, we establish a connection with nonstationary online learning by following the notion of a variation budget. We start by making the observation that existing approaches for nonstationary online learning cannot precisely delineate the dynamics incurred by the retailer’s inventory learning policy, and may lead to linear growth in the supplier’s regret under some well-known retailer inventory learning policies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new notion of variation budget, which better quantifies the impact of the retailer’s learning on the supplier’s decision-making environment. We also demonstrate the advantages of our new model for the variation budget in our setting over those in the existing literature. We then proceed to propose dynamic pricing policies for the supplier for both discrete and continuous demand distributions. Our pricing policies lead to sublinear regret bounds for the supplier under a wide range of retailer inventory learning policies. Our pricing policies empirically outperform those from the existing nonstationary online learning literature. At the managerial level, we answer affirmatively that there is a pricing policy with a sublinear regret bound for the supplier under a wide range of retailer inventory learning policies, even though she faces a learning retailer and an unknown demand distribution. Our work also provides a novel perspective in data-driven operations management where the principal has to learn to react to the learning policies employed by other agents in the system.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03339 .</content>

    <title>A Method for Asynchronous Time Series Analysis with Marketing Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many time series data evolve asynchronously. In marketing, for example, we observe ad liking every second, hourly clickstreams, daily sales, weekly brand awareness, or monthly ad expenditures. Thus, the question arises: how to estimate dynamic models when metrics evolve at different frequencies? To this end, we develop a new method for estimation and inference of state space models for asynchronous data. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed method does not require any data preprocessing to align frequencies. We derive the optimal gain factor from first principles and demonstrate in three simulation studies that the new method recovers model parameters as accurately as the full-information Kalman filter as if all data were available. This finding holds across various degrees of noise levels and data sparsity. More importantly, we show that ignoring data asynchronicity results in substantially biased parameter estimates. Empirically, we illustrate the efficacy of the new method via two applications: copy testing of an advertisement and a marketing mix model, both with asynchronous data. It yields meaningful results compared with those obtained by aligning asynchronous data to the slowest frequency (i.e., data aggregation). In the marketing mix application, for example, data aggregation produces erroneously insignificant estimates of sales carryover and TV effectiveness, and these become significant when we apply the new method. These biased estimates can have serious managerial consequences. Thus, the proposed method paves the way to analyze asynchronous time series data: slow- or fast-moving dependent variables, slow- or fast-moving independent variables, and all of them at equal or unequal frequencies.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Marketing Science Institute [Grant 4-1959].

    <title>Dynamic Control of a Make-to-Order System Under Model Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deriving control policies for a make-to-order manufacturing system is often predicated on a well-specified probabilistic model that governs demand realization. In practice, however, such a model may be a simplification of the actual scenario because of tractability considerations. Consequently, policies obtained under such simplifications may perform poorly if the assumed model does not accurately capture reality. In this paper, we propose a modeling paradigm that can generate control policies based on a simplified model, accounting for possible model errors that may result. The make-to-order system offers multiple products and has an outsourcing mechanism. Our focus is on addressing deliberate model simplification for the demand realization process. We formulate a robust control problem that takes the form of a two-player, zero-sum game. Because the original formulation is not tractable enough, we further develop an approximating problem under the heavy-traffic assumption that effectively results in a stochastic differential game. The solution to this game then translates into an implementable control policy for the original make-to-order system. We supplement the proposed modeling paradigm with a simulation-based method for selecting an appropriate uncertainty set. Numerical experiments expose, among other things, the value of building robustness into decision making.This paper was accepted by Barış Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: X.

    <title>How to Mitigate Misinformation Diffusion on Blockchain‐Based Decentralized Social Network Platforms? Insights From an Agent‐Based Simulation Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the spread of misinformation on centralized social media platforms has received significant attention, few studies compare centralized and decentralized platforms, and how to mitigate misinformation diffusion in newly emerging blockchain‐based decentralized social network platforms. We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent‐based simulations leveraging real‐world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measured as yield spreads against Treasury securities and AAA corporate bonds, the convenience premium of newly issued agency MBS averages more than half of the long-term Treasury convenience premium. The agency MBS convenience premium and issuance amount vary negatively with mortgage rate, consistent with a prepayment-driven channel. Placing agencies into conservatorship in 2008 and introducing liquidity regulations in 2013 significantly affected MBS convenience premium, consistent with government guarantee and regulatory treatment channels. Analyses of dispersion of dealers’ prepayment forecasts, seasoned MBS, and investors’ MBS holdings deliver further economic implications for agency MBS as safe assets.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate investors’ disagreement regarding firm news and assess its ability to predict stock returns. Specifically, we quantify firm-level investor disagreement through the volume-volatility elasticity surrounding firm news; higher elasticity is associated with less investor disagreement. Intuitively, disagreement introduces additional trading motives that are not driven by price changes, weakening the connection between volume and volatility. Our findings indicate that investor disagreement on news negatively predicts cross-sectional returns. We also present empirical evidence aligned with the theoretical predictions of a recently developed model by Atmaz and Basak (Journal of Finance 73 (3): 1225–1279 2018) that the negative disagreement-stock relation strengthens when the optimism effect dominates the uncertainty effect. Importantly, this predictive relationship remains robust after controlling for news heterogeneity, other volume- and volatility-based measures, and alternative channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how global changes in information acquisition costs through disclosure technologies affect price informativeness. To explore this issue, we examine worldwide adoptions of centralized electronic disclosure systems, which significantly reduce the cost of and broaden access to financial disclosures. Consistent with theory, we show a significant reduction in private information acquisition around earnings announcements as a result of these adoptions. These effects are most pronounced in countries with the most substantial reductions in information acquisition costs and where we find more significant decreases in informed trade. Overall, we highlight an important, unintended cost of broadening access to financial disclosures through technology adoptions.</content>

    <title>Distributional Growth Accounting: Education and the Reduction of Global Poverty, 1980-2019</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the role played by education in the reduction of global poverty. I propose tools for identifying the contribution of schooling to economic growth by income group, integrating imperfect substitution between skill groups into macroeconomic growth decomposition. I bring this “distributional growth accounting” framework to the data by exploiting a new microdatabase representative of nearly all of the world’s population, new estimates of the private returns to schooling, and historical income distribution statistics. Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education. Because they ignore the distributional effects of schooling, standard growth accounting methods substantially underestimate economic benefits of education for the global poor.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To realize complementary value in ecosystems, organizations engage in architectural learning, which involves searching for interdependencies and specifying interactions with external complements. In this article, we explore how this process differs when potential complements are not yet fully interoperable and complementarity is emergent. We report on a longitudinal case study of a 3D printer company that shifted from producing inexpensive personal desktop 3D printers to the professional 3D printing ecosystem. The company intensively used proxies (stand-in components) to support learning about interdependencies with potential external complements. This process informed internal component adaptations and the design of boundary resources that enabled third-party complementors to make their components fully complementary. From this case, we theorize this process in terms of shaping a complementarity space: a problem space in which organizations iteratively draw on proxies to provide resources such as interfaces and tools to transfer complementary capabilities to other organizations. We discuss theoretical implications for research on architectural learning and ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multilocation, Dynamic Staff Planning for a Healthcare System: Methodology and ApplicationThis study develops and implements a robust optimization model for dynamically assigning anesthesiologists across multiple hospitals in a large health system. The model addresses uncertainty in surgical demand by incorporating a three-stage decision process: presurgical location assignments, midhorizon on-call deployment, and day-of realization of overtime or idleness. The authors formulate the problem as a multistage robust mixed-integer program and solve it efficiently using a novel nested column and constraint generation algorithm. The approach accounts for location-specific constraints and fairness in on-call duties using historical data to estimate demand uncertainty with a calibrated trade-off between optimality and robustness. Implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the model reduced annual staffing costs by 12% or roughly $800,000 compared to existing practice. The framework is generalizable to other staffing problems in healthcare and provides operational insights on the value of forecast accuracy, location flexibility, and equitable workload distribution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most organizations encourage employees to provide feedback to one another to support learning, personal growth, and career advancement. However, employee feedback often fails to improve performance because it lacks concrete, specific guidance. We provide a temporal explanation for why workplace input processes routinely fail to produce valuable and concrete developmental insights: they are insufficiently focused on the future. In this paper, we theorize and demonstrate that encouraging input providers to think about the future leads them to produce more concrete developmental input. Across a large scale, preregistered field experiment (n = 27,432 comments) and two laboratory studies (n = 806), people provide more concrete and actionable developmental input when they are prompted to provide future-looking “advice” rather than “feedback,” a common method of soliciting input in organizations. The effect of soliciting advice on input concreteness was mediated by providers’ future focus. Moreover, in a follow-up study, such concrete input was assessed by independent raters as more useful. These findings highlight the role of temporal orientation in driving the content of developmental input. In doing so, our data suggest that individuals and organizations have the potential to promote higher-quality developmental input by attending to the temporal orientation that their input systems encourage.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: Funding for the laboratory experiments was provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03207 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a unique experiment of anonymizing online loan applications to test whether race-blind screening procedures reduce racial disparities in consumer credit. With names on applications, minority applicants are 10% less likely to receive online loan offers and receive worse offer terms than otherwise identical majority applicants. Anonymizing applications reduces such disparities substantially. High-income minority applicants benefit more than low-income minorities. We show that the racial disparities are not driven by differences in credit demand. Overall, anonymous loan applications reduce racial disparities in access to credit by increasing lender reliance on objective credit risk measures.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This research is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its Social Science Research Thematic Grant [Grant MOE2019-SSRTG-024].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the roles of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists (VCs), and the government in financing fundamental innovations, defined as those with a positive social value net of development costs but often with negative net present values to innovating firms, for example, a vaccine against COVID-19. We first analyze the case where the entrepreneur, with or without VC financing, develops innovations. We then analyze government support of innovation and the government’s choice between subsidies and innovation prizes. We further analyze the optimal interactions between government and VC financing, showing that the government may optimally channel subsidies partially through VCs, thus rationalizing government-funded VCs. Overall, our paper provides a framework for the optimal choice of sectors and technologies to receive government support (e.g., subsidies included in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022) and how any government support should be structured to best motivate innovation.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a second-price auction with a flexible reserve price, where the reserve price for the top bidder is not fixed but rather determined as a function of all losing bids. We show that when bidders are ex ante heterogeneous, a second-price auction with an optimally chosen flexible reserve price not only generates strictly higher expected revenue than that of a second-price auction with any fixed reserve price but is also revenue-maximizing among all mechanisms that implement discrimination-free social choice functions. We also provide an axiomatic characterization of all second-price auctions with a flexible reserve price. Finally, we discuss real-life implementation.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Oesterreichische Nationalbank [Grant 19021] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72203148].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04584 .</content>

    <title>Too Good To Go: Combating Food Waste with Surprise Clearance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies surprise clearance as an innovative business model to increase store profit and reduce food waste. A store holding surprise clearance sells “surprise bags” composed of surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. At the time of ordering, consumers are uncertain about the quantity of food items included in a surprise bag. We model surprise clearance and compare it with both no clearance and transparent clearance, which sets a transparent unit clearance price based on the amount of surplus food after regular sales. We find that surprise clearance achieves the highest store profit and induces the most store production among the three selling schemes. Although both clearance schemes have the ability to eliminate store waste, the store effectively does so under surprise clearance but deliberately does not under transparent clearance. In fact, transparent clearance may generate even more store waste than no clearance. Further, both clearance schemes exacerbate the problem of consumer waste compared with no clearance, and despite zero store waste, surprise clearance generates the most consumer waste among the three schemes. If clearance sales target a consumer segment with a sufficiently low valuation of consumption, both clearance schemes reduce total waste, and surprise clearance is a win-win-win solution that maximizes store profit and social welfare and minimizes total waste among the three schemes. However, there are circumstances under which both clearance schemes fail to reduce total waste, and surprise clearance may generate the most total waste.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: L.

    <title>Setting the Stage: Line Managers' &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Orientation as an Antecedent to Perceived &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The field of strategic human resource (HR) management has shown an increasing focus on how employees perceive and react to their organization's HR practices. In this perspective, employees are not passive recipients of HR policies or mere observers of their managers' HR implementation strategies. Rather, their perceptions play a critical role in shaping organizational culture and fostering high‐performing workplaces. However, important questions remain regarding how line management roles shape not only employees' assessments of their work environment but also their perceptions of HR effectiveness. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, we argue that line managers' compliance‐ versus commitment‐focused orientations influence employee appraisals of threats and challenges in their jobs. These appraisals, in turn, shape how employees evaluate the effectiveness of their organization's HR practices (i.e., perceived HR effectiveness). Using qualitative data from focus groups and a multilevel quantitative research design, we find evidence supporting our hypotheses, showing that line managers' HR orientations significantly influence employees' cognitive appraisals and subsequent perceptions of HR effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical contributions and offering practical recommendations for improving the implementation of HR practices.</content>

    <title>Does Tax-Benefit Linkage Matter for the Incidence of Payroll Taxes?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyse earnings responses to six large payroll tax and income tax reforms in France. Our findings indicate full pass-through to workers when there is a strong and transparent link between contributions and expected benefits. In contrast, employer payroll taxes with no tax-benefit linkage exhibit limited pass-through to workers, while income tax nominally borne by employees show nearly full pass-through. Together with a meta-analysis of the literature, we interpret these results as empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that tax-benefit linkage matters for the incidence of payroll taxes. In the absence of such linkage, our findings suggest that the individual-level incidence of payroll taxes aligns with their statutory incidence.</content>

    <title>Virtually Even: Status Equalizing in Distributed Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In distributed organizations, perceived status differences between workers are ubiquitous and harmful. Yet research suggests that once they are formed, status beliefs in organizations become entrenched in hierarchies and are hard to dismantle. In an inductive qualitative study, we observed how established status differences between remote and in-person workers in distributed organizations dissolved during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone began working remotely. We use these data to theorize a novel status-equalizing process through which remote workers came to see themselves on an “equal playing field” with their in-person peers. We theorize how this status equalizing occurred through workers’ changing their “in-person default” use of technology—that is, their new behavior challenged embedded cultural practices that had treated the in-person workplace experience as the standard, normal, and valued perspective, implicitly guiding how employees used technology. Workers adopted new and more inclusive technology practices—including the use of asynchronous communication, greater codification of work, and virtual socializing—which resulted in remote workers perceiving new and more equal communication standards, access to information, and opportunity for social connection. As a result, these workers reported feeling less negatively stereotyped and treated more fairly in their virtual interactions with colleagues, fostering feelings of inclusion and deepening relationships across the previously established status divide. At a time when many organizations are grappling with the challenges of distributed, remote, and hybrid work, our research illuminates how inclusive technology practices can help nullify entrenched status imbalances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bayesian Learning for Data-Driven Stochastic Optimal ControlStochastic optimal control (SOC) provides a principled approach to dynamic decision making under uncertainty. It models the transition of the system state with a dynamic equation driven by randomness, with the assumption that the distribution of randomness is known. However, in practical problems, modeling randomness frequently depends on data or observations, which introduces uncertainty regarding the distribution of randomness. To address the data-driven SOC problem, in “Episodic Bayesian Optimal Control with Unknown Randomness Distributions,” Shapiro, Zhou, Lin, and Wang propose a new approach that incorporates Bayesian learning with optimal control in an episodic manner. They show the convergence and convergence rate results for their approach. They also develop an efficient computational method for a class of problems that have convex cost functions and linear state dynamics.</content>

    <title>Closer to Home: A Structural Estimate-Then-Optimize Approach to Improve Access to Healthcare Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geographic inequalities in healthcare access extend beyond rural–urban divides to include socioeconomic, racial, and other disparities. Proximity to hospitals, clinics, healthcare providers, and pharmacies varies widely, posing a challenge in deciding where to strategically locate such facilities. Demand for each service depends on local population health, individual preferences, provider capacity, and other factors. This study introduces a novel structural estimate-then-optimize (SETO) framework, combining structural demand estimation using a modified Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes approach that accounts for provider capacity with a choice-based optimal facility location model to maximize health service utilization. Our methodology is illustrated with a case study on the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program in California, a public–private partnership that administered millions of COVID-19 vaccinations. Demand estimates indicate that residents of socioeconomically vulnerable communities are more sensitive to travel distances to pharmacy-based vaccination sites. Strategically adding 500 retail stores serving lower-income communities increases predicted vaccinations by 2.9% overall (770,000 additional vaccinations statewide) and by 5.3% in the least healthy neighborhoods. Our integrative SETO approach outperforms heuristics that allocate resources based on current vaccination rates, existing service gaps, population density, or predicted demand. The case study demonstrates the importance of (1) accounting for heterogeneity in estimating demand and (2) selecting partnerships to complement existing networks with spatially heterogeneous supply and efficiently fill service gaps. Our study provides a systematic approach to optimize healthcare delivery networks, using publicly available aggregate data while accounting for individuals’ preferences, highlighting the value of combining a structural demand model with prescriptive analytics.This paper was accepted by Stefan Sholtes, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06274 .</content>

    <title>Unbottling Time: Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty and ‘Time‐Less Organizing’ at a Bottled Water Plant Occupation in Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how Indigenous Zapatista‐influenced activists enact temporal sovereignty to resist corporate water extraction, challenging dominant Western organizational temporalities. Through qualitative in‐person research of the 2021 occupation of a water bottling plant in Mexico, I explore how activists transformed the site into a non‐capitalist communal space, creating alternative temporal rhythms rooted in Zapatista principles such as ‘walking at the pace of the slowest’ and collective autonomy. The findings reveal how activists rejected efficiency‐driven deadlines, prioritized ecological cycles over productivity metrics, and fostered relational well‐being through inclusive decision‐making. These practices culminated in what I conceptualize as ‘time‐less organizing’ – a framework for non‐capitalist horizontal organizing that operates outside conventional time logics. The study contributes to the management and organizing literature by theorizing temporal sovereignty as resistance to imposed temporalities, extending critiques of stakeholder theory by exposing how corporate temporal constraints perpetuate marginalization, and demonstrating how communities reclaim autonomy through alternative temporal practices. The findings challenge assumptions of time as a resource to be managed for efficiency gains, offering future avenues of research for addressing grand challenges through decelerated and relational approaches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We note that while the institutional environment determines the actions and structures of constituent organizations, there are still limited insights available in the literature on the nature and process of interactions between key stakeholders in ambulance services, especially as they respond during a significant crisis. This study specifically examines how a positive social exchange between senior leadership, managers, and frontline staff, accompanied by changes to the leadership style and HR practices, resulted in significant service transformation. An in‐depth qualitative case study design was used to interview 52 frontline staff and leaders from the UK National Health Service's (NHS) Ambulance Service over a prolonged period of 8 months (October 2020 to May 2021). Interviews and secondary data were abductively analyzed, showing how changes to HRM and leadership practices shaped service transformation's content, process, and logic. The findings suggest that an iterative social exchange between the key social actors in the Ambulance Trust led to adaptations to the nature of HRM and leadership practices, which positively impacted the changes to service delivery, leading to service transformation and improved health and well‐being of paramedics. Our conceptual framework contributes to the literature by integrating how the use of agency, new HRM, and leadership practices in the context of institutionalized structures can result in service transformation. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational socialization and the practice of onboarding new hires are central human resources functions. However, traditional socialization theory and practice were built on assumptions that are increasingly misaligned with today's work context. We identified four current, emerging, and future work trends that characterize the evolving landscape surrounding organizational socialization: technological advancement, the expansion of remote work arrangements, rising societal loneliness and mental health challenges, and aging workforce demographics. Collectively, these trends have contributed to dramatic shifts in the context and performance of work, as well as the expectations that employees and organizations hold for one another. Accordingly, we argue that these shifts require a renewed examination of the organizational socialization process that reflects contemporary realities such as the move away from stable, physically co‐located, psychologically anchored work toward boundaryless, tech‐mediated, and transient work arrangements. Our review presents a future‐forward look at organizational socialization through the lens of these societal and workplace shifts. We identify newcomer adaptability and connection as emergent critical factors for the future of onboarding. Through this lens, we offer practical implications for human resource practice and invite future research that advances our understanding of organizational socialization in today's context.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unemployment differentials are greater between countries in the euro area than between U.S. states. In both regions, net migration responds to unemployment differentials, though the response is smaller in the euro area compared to the United States. We use a multi-country DSGE model with cross-border migration to quantify Mundell’s hypothesis that labor mobility could substitute for independent monetary policy in a currency union. While not as effective as independent monetary policy, increased labor mobility reduces business cycle fluctuations for most countries in the euro area. However, Mundell’s conjecture does not hold uniformly. For countries that primarily face demand shocks, labor mobility stabilizes inflation and unemployment and improves welfare. If supply shocks are dominant however, labor mobility increases the cost of being in a currency union by magnifying inflation volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate executives often use metaphors, particularly those derived from war imagery, when communicating their strategic intentions. This study examines the influence of metaphorical framing in corporate communication, particularly its effect on analyst reactions to firms’ acquisition announcements. We theorize and analyze the impact of metaphor families that either emphasize or downplay competition while considering the diverse source domains from which these metaphors originate. We propose a theoretical framework that integrates conceptual metaphor theory with the risk-as-feelings perspective, suggesting that certain metaphors can evoke visceral perceptions of danger. Our findings reveal that using metaphors in acquisition announcements generally elicits negative reactions. Notably, metaphors from the competition family, especially war-related ones signifying competitive aggression, evoke stronger adverse reactions. The detrimental impact of war language substantially diminishes in contexts where aggressive competition is expected. We contribute to strategic communication research by highlighting the contingent influence of metaphorical framing on audience reactions, emphasizing the importance of metaphor families, source domains, and contextual factors.Funding: J.

    <title>Fat Tails in Human Judgment: Empirical Evidence and Implications for the Aggregation of Estimates and Forecasts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How frequent are large disagreements in human judgment? The substantial literature relating to expert assessments of real-valued quantities and their aggregation almost universally assumes that judgment errors follow a jointly normal distribution. We investigate this question empirically using 73 data sets from four different sources that include over 169,000 estimates and forecasts. We find incontrovertible evidence for excess kurtosis: that is, of fat tails. Despite the diversity of the analyzed data, varying in how much uncertainty there is in the quantity being assessed and varying in the level of expertise and of sophistication of those making the assessments, we find surprising consistency in the frequency with which an individual judgment is in large disagreement with the consensus. Fitting a generalized normal distribution to the data, we find most estimates for the shape parameter to be between 0.9 and 1.6 (where 1 is the double-exponential distribution and 2 is the normal distribution). This has important implications, in particular for the aggregation of expert estimates and forecasts and for the construction of confidence intervals. We describe optimal Bayesian aggregation with fat tails and propose a simple average-median average heuristic that performs well for the range of empirically observed distributions.This paper was accepted by Manuel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04006 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The perils of legitimacy threats for CBAs are widely acknowledged in the literature. However, prior research has focused on legitimacy threats stemming from factors not in the direct control of MNEs. In this study, we explore if and how acquirers’ CSI salience, a legitimacy threat stemming directly from the past actions and behaviors of the focal firm, influences a critical international expansion decision—the level of ownership obtained in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs). Drawing on neo-institutional theory, we argue that CSI salience reduces the level of ownership obtained in CBAs as it captures more stakeholder attention and is factored into their legitimacy evaluations. In addition, we examine how characteristics of the host country’s legitimating environment may attenuate or accentuate the legitimacy threat from CSI as they reflect how host country stakeholders notice, assess, and respond to CSI and the capacity of host institutions to monitor and enforce compliance. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 16,650 CBAs by 10,738 unique acquirers, and offer valuable insights into the interplay of CSI salience, legitimacy, and CBA ownership to research and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bonuses are notoriously used to motivate workers. How effective are they at doing so, and might there be unintended consequences? We investigated the effectiveness of bonuses based on game profitability on the motivation of video game developers by examining specific bonus characteristics that align with advice derived from expectancy theory. We also investigated if bonuses encouraged or discouraged moral engagement and corner‐cutting behavior through their effects on work motivation as conceptualized through self‐determination theory. Company data on bonus characteristics coupled with surveys from 1024 game developers in a video game company indicated that the size of the last received bonus did not influence current work motivation. Uncertain probability of getting the next bonus installment was related to a lack of motivation, while more certain probability was related to higher intrinsic motivation. The probable size of the next bonus was related to lower external regulation and to higher intrinsic motivation, contrary to predictions from most motivation theories. Both probability certainty and bonus size probability were indirectly negatively associated with moral disengagement and corner‐cutting behaviors via decreasing amotivation and external regulation. Overall, results show that the bonus system in this company had limited effects on motivation and on discouraging deviant behaviors and point to how such systems can be improved using advice from theory.</content>

    <title>The Dual Effects of Algorithmic Management on Platform Workers: An Attribution Perspective</title>
    <updated>2025-07-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research often highlights the negative consequences of algorithmic management (AM) for platform workers. By contrast, less is known about what, how, and when AM may produce both positive and negative outcomes. Drawing on attribution theory, this study examines the dual effects of core AM dimensions (i.e., algorithmic recommending, restricting, evaluating, and rewarding) on platform workers' perceptions of work overload and customer‐oriented service behavior. A two‐wave survey of 213 online platform workers in China reveals that algorithmic recommending and rewarding improve customer‐oriented service behavior and reduce work overload through AM commitment attributions. However, AM control attributions link algorithmic restricting, recommending, and evaluating (the latter two at low algorithmic transparency) to increased work overload. Algorithmic transparency moderates these effects, reducing the negative impacts of AM through AM control attributions. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the dual effects of core AM dimensions and provide practical insights for platforms seeking to enhance service quality while supporting worker well‐being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain comprising a downstream retailer and multiple complementary suppliers. Suppliers can form coalitions to jointly invest in sustainable production technologies and enhance the product’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) level. Coalition members benefit from efficiency gains through shared knowledge and information about green production. The retailer sources from these coalitions and sells the product to heterogeneous consumers. We develop a game-theoretical model and use the notion of Nash stability to characterize equilibrium coalition structures and firms’ optimal decisions under three profit allocation rules. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Forming supplier coalitions can benefit all stakeholders (including the retailer, suppliers, and society) but achieving such a win–win–win outcome hinges on two factors: the market’s consciousness rate (i.e., the proportion of socially conscious consumers) and the efficiency gains from coalition formation. (2) The grand coalition that maximizes the retailer’s profit and CSR level is not always stable due to free-riding behaviors. In particular, less efficient suppliers may defect to avoid the cost of sustainable innovation while still benefiting from the high innovation efforts of others (i.e., cross-coalition free-riding). (3) On the supply side, adopting the Shapley value allocation rule exacerbates within-coalition free-riding by assigning greater profit shares to less efficient suppliers. However, it also reduces their incentive to defect, thus enhancing coalition stability. Moreover, greater total efficiency and a smaller efficiency gap among suppliers further improve the stability of the grand coalition. (4) On the demand side, the impact of increasing the market’s consciousness rate is non-monotonic. Improperly influencing consumer awareness may destabilize coalitions and produce unintended consequences, suggesting that the retailer must proceed with caution.</content>

    <title>A Deep Demand Response Program for Local Electricity Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The decarbonization of power systems facilitates the  electrification of appliances, many of which can be operated in a flexible way. Demand response (DR) programs can exploit this flexibility with retail price adjustment, thereby addressing several operational challenges. In this paper, we address the welfare optimization problem of local utilities that procure electricity for their customers at the wholesale market. We demonstrate how DR programs can be designed for local electricity systems where electricity demand and its response to temporary price changes is unknown. For this purpose, we address a novel and complex pricing problem—pricing under unknown, time-interdependent, and discontinuous demand—leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning. Using a numerical case study calibrated on Californian electricity market data, we show that such a “Deep DR program” helps to identify effective prices that improve social welfare. The performance of the program is consistently positive across a variety of system conditions. We further demonstrate that our approach beats Time-of-Use tariff-based benchmarks already after five and a parametric benchmark after 19 simulation days, on average. Second, we provide novel insights regarding an important but frequently overlooked aspect of DR program design: The length of the notification interval, that is the timespan for which future prices must be set in advance. We find that the timing of price information is important and that longer notification intervals can improve social welfare. Finally, we provide insights into DR price setting and find that DR prices co-move with wholesale market prices but are lower for longer notification intervals and shorter event sequences. The presented Deep DR program provides an example of how advances in machine learning-based algorithms can help to meet the complex operational requirements of future local electricity systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Managing Quality Risk in a Decentralized Supply Chain: Contractual Incentives and Product Recall Insurance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a two-echelon decentralized supply chain where the probability of selling nondefective products depends on the supplier’s quality improvement and the buyer’s inspection efforts. Products assembled from defective components cause a recall that leads to external failure costs for the buyer. Both players’ efforts are not contractible and it is a challenge to align inspection and quality-improvement efforts in a decentralized supply chain. We find that a procurement contract can provide preventive incentives that induce high inspection efforts and enhancing incentives that enable the supplier to credibly commit to high-quality components. However, these contractual incentives only align two players’ efforts under certain conditions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that introducing a product recall (PR) insurance requirement into a standard procurement contract provided by the buyer can complement enhancing incentives and lead to quality improvement in components. More importantly, as PR insurance can improve the flexibility of risk-sharing arrangements between the supplier and the buyer, we show that it can also serve as a coordinating role in improving the performance of a decentralized supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Warehouse Assortment Selection: Minimizing Order Splitting in E-commerce Logistics</title>
    <updated>2025-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Order splitting is one of the key issues in the e-commerce order fulfillment process. It increases operational costs, elevates carbon emissions, and compromises customer satisfaction. This paper focuses on determining the product assortments to store within the multi-warehouse logistics network to minimize the total number of split orders subject to cardinality constraints. We show that this minimizing split orders (MSO) problem is NP-hard and demonstrate that even finding an optimal order fulfillment strategy with a given assortment selection is NP-hard. To further analyze the MSO problem, we introduce a concept termedthe second-order dominant indexing rule. This indexing rule corresponds to a group of demand distributions, under which we are able to characterize the structure of the optimal assortment selection for various scenarios. In particular, when assortment overlapping is prohibited, the optimal selection can be explicitly derived. When the demand exhibits a total nested structure, an optimal selection is non-overlapping with more popular products allocated to larger warehouses. We also bridge the two-warehouse order splitting minimization problem with the single-warehouse assortment selection problem in the literature. Building upon this connection, we propose an Extended Marginal Choice Indexing (MCI) policy, which is proven to achieve optimality when the demand has a second-order dominant MCI. In addition, we propose an Iterative Improvement Heuristic that refines any existing assortment selection. The efficiency of the proposed heuristics is validated by extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating that the extended MCI policy performs near-optimally even when customer demand is not ideal, and both heuristics outperform the best benchmark in existing literature. Additional experiments on real-world data further confirm their effectiveness and scalability. Finally, we extend our findings to a two-tier multi-warehouse scenario with a back-end warehouse.</content>

    <title>Profit Implications of Judgmental Adjustments to Forecast Inputs: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we report the results from a large-scale field experiment at a spare parts retail chain that considers whether allowing merchants to override forecast inputs to an inventory algorithm improves profits. Although the judgmental forecasting literature has studied extensively whether judgmental adjustments improve forecast performance, causal empirical evidence is missing in regard to whether judgmental adjustments improve bottom-line profits. Our results show that judgmental adjustments to the forecast input increase profitability by 4.92% on average compared with relying on automation without human intervention. We find that the well-established motivation-opportunity-ability framework provides clear insight into when judgmental adjustments improve profits, by examining heterogeneity in our data regarding stock-keeping unit margin, lifecycle, and size of supplier. Our data set also allows for examining both forecast accuracy and profits. We empirically support the wisdom from the judgmental forecasting literature that forecast performance need not translate to profit performance, calling attention to the need to consider operational performance beyond forecast accuracy as an end in itself.This paper has been accepted by Felipe Caro for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06321 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Marketing and Economics of Harm Reduction: Evidence from Conservation Field Experiments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends the canonical harm reduction approach to a wider set of applications, including conservation. We develop an economic model to illustrate the trade-offs inherent to harm reduction, weighing the benefits of reducing harm against the risk of drawing those previously abstaining into consumption, and identify contexts where it is not applicable. Using sequential campaigns with embedded experimentation that enables measurement, we market a harm reduction solution in the context of water conservation. We show that a smart irrigation controller that efficiently maintains stigmatized ornamental landscapes appeals to the heaviest irrigators and generates large and long-lasting individual and social benefits: cost recovery in six months and water savings covering another household’s basic needs. We find no evidence it cannibalizes abstinence (lawn removal) or increases irrigation by conservation-prone individuals. Our conceptual and measurement framework provides a foundation for implementing and evaluating harm reduction well beyond the typical drug and public health contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare execution quality of six brokerage accounts across five brokers by generating a sample of 85,000 simultaneous market orders. Commission levels and payment for order flow (PFOF) differ across our accounts. We find that execution prices vary significantly across brokers: the mean account‐level round‐trip cost ranges from 0.07% to 0.46%, excluding any commissions. The dispersion is due to off‐exchange wholesalers systematically giving different execution prices for the same trades to different brokers. Across brokers, variation in PFOF does not explain the large variation in price execution. We provide several suggestions for more informative disclosures on execution quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the dynamics of internal forecasting in multi‐location firms and the relations between forecast characteristics and investment. Using U.S. Census microdata on plant‐level growth expectations, we find that plants within multi‐location firms make forecasts that are both more certain and less accurate than those of standalone plants. We provide evidence suggesting that headquarters infers uncertainty from inter‐plant forecast disagreement, and that headquarters is able to facilitate the use of relevant information held by one plant but applicable to another. Differences between peer and focal plants' forecasts predict forecast errors and relate to investment decisions at the focal plant, suggesting that information from multiple sources is integrated into capital allocation decisions. Headquarters' heavier use of peer plant forecast information when focal plants are more uncertain likely weakens focal plant managers' incentives to consider extreme scenarios when forecasting.</content>

    <title>Voice Flow to Managers or Voice Flow Around Managers: Voice From the Shopfloor in Iran</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The extant voice literature is largely Anglo‐American and often assumes formal, management‐designed or union voice channels, which may not always be accessible to employees in non‐Western, autocratic developing countries where silence is often forced upon employees. Given this unfavorable context for voice, how do employees navigate managerial constraints to assert their agency? Drawing on ethnographic research in a multi‐site manufacturer of auto parts in Iran, we show how formal voice channels are set up by employers, how voice flows through these management mechanisms, the employee experience of the process, and how employees respond by developing their own informal channels. The findings highlight the importance of viewing voice through a dynamic, context‐bound lens, and how, if voice does not flow to managers, it can flow around them. We show how management's espoused effort to promote voice resulted not only in less voicing but also counterproductive work behavior. These findings advance a contextualist perspective of employee voice, highlighting how local contexts shape worker agency in articulating their voices, and offering key insights for HRM practices, especially in designing strategies that account for cultural and organizational dynamics.</content>

    <title>Bunch of jerks: How brands can benefit by reappropriating insults</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands are increasingly finding themselves on the receiving end of negative labels from a variety of sources. While sometimes warranted, many of these negative labels feel like unwarranted or uncivil insults. Brands generally respond to such undeserved degradation by ignoring the insult, denying the insult, or perhaps apologizing to the insulter. This research explores another potential strategy: reappropriating the insult. We reveal that reappropriation—an intentional act of verbatim self‐labeling with an externally imposed negative label—can garner unexpected benefits for brands, including greater advertisement click‐through rate, interest, and more positive attitudes. The advantage of reappropriation is driven by perceptions of the brand's confidence and humor and is specific to situations in which the reappropriated insult is perceived to be unjustified and ultimately benign in nature. This work contributes to our understanding of how brands can recover from negative events and how reappropriation operates uniquely in an unexplored marketplace context. We also provide a novel recovery tactic for brand managers facing certain types of hostility.</content>

    <title>From Workplace‐Based to Work‐Related Violence: Reframing &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Research and Practice in the Era of Growing Tensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Violence at work has traditionally been conceptualized in human resource management (HRM) as workplace‐based violence—an episodic, interpersonal issue occurring within bounded organizational settings. This perspective article adopts the term work‐related violence as a more expansive and timely framing, encompassing physical, psychological, and symbolic harm related to work but occurring across dispersed geographies, identities, relationships, and organizational arrangements. It contends that prevailing HRM frameworks remain ill‐equipped to address these fragmented and often unacknowledged harms, particularly as work becomes increasingly hybrid, precarious, and digitally mediated. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, we advance a multilevel and multistakeholder analytical framework that theorizes violence as relational and spatially unbounded, embedded across micro (identity and employees' lived experience, and psychological factors), meso (organizational culture, HRM systems and silencing mechanisms), and macro (regulatory, ideological, and institutional) levels. The framework further identifies underexplored domains of violence within HRM, including employee‐perpetrated violence, ideologically motivated aggression, and the critical role of community‐based interventions in mitigating harm. In doing so, the article contributes to HRM theory by problematizing the spatial and behavioral assumptions underpinning conventional approaches to workplace violence. We argue for a broadened research and practice agenda that expands the field's analytical and operational capacity, calling for the development of HRM models that are structurally, institutionally, and ideologically attuned to violence emerging from inequality, institutional complicity, and the broader political economies of contemporary work.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The implementation of servitization as a business strategy remains a significant challenge for firms seeking to offer integrated product‐service bundles. Despite the growing body of research in the servitization literature, an integrative framework for explaining the recurring failures in servitization efforts has yet to emerge. Through a qualitative meta‐analysis of empirical evidence documented in existing case studies, we develop a process theory that examines the tensions between product and service businesses during the service business development process. Our study identifies three common servitization failure modes, highlights the contributing factors across various stages of servitization, and establishes causal links between structural elements and behavioral outcomes to explain the heterogeneity in service business performance. By adopting a process perspective, we provide a more nuanced understanding of servitization dynamics, offering new insights that complement and extend established theories on firm growth and capability development. We conclude by discussing managerial implications for firms pursuing a servitization strategy and outlining future research steps to test and further refine the proposed theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many regulations aim to promote coordination among creditors in bankruptcy by ex post restricting their ability to exit distressed firms. However, such restrictions may harm creditors’ ex ante incentives to stay invested, thereby worsening coordination outcomes. We build a dynamic coordination model to show how this force shapes creditor runs, bankruptcy filings, and regulation designs. Intriguingly, filing for bankruptcy early, thereby preserving more assets for latecomers, can prolong firm life. Furthermore, regulators’ clawbacks on prebankruptcy repayments can be superior to firms’ commitment to early bankruptcy filing. Our analysis generates implications for automatic stay, avoidable preference, bank failures, and seniority structure. (JEL D83, G33, G38)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey a large, representative sample of retail investors in China to elicit their memories of stock market investments and their return expectations. We merge these survey data with administrative transaction data to test a model in which investors selectively recall past experiences to form their beliefs. Our analysis uncovers new facts about investor memory and highlights similarity-based recall as a key mechanism of belief formation in financial markets. A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns. Recalled experiences can explain cross-investor variation in return expectations and, in our setting, dominate actual experiences in their explanatory power. In the transaction data, we confirm that recalled experiences are reflected in investors’ trading decisions through a belief channel.</content>

    <title>Innovating Green: Competition Meets Regulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study shows that competition drives corporate innovation under intense environmental regulatory pressure. Using the nonattainment status of U.S. counties as an exogenous variation in regulation, we find that competition spurs green innovation as firms respond to stricter policies. Firms are particularly motivated to innovate in clean technology when operating in pollution-intensive industries, facing high relocation costs, and possessing a strong history of innovation. Regulation-driven green innovation allows firms to differentiate their products, enhance their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reputation, and attract more corporate customers, leading to higher sales growth, increased market share, and improved profitability, although not necessarily higher valuation. Stricter regulations in competitive environments not only curb pollution but also serve as a catalyst for sustainable long-term innovation. These findings emphasize the vital role of environmental regulations in promoting sustainable practices and operational benefits, underscoring the importance of well-designed policies to drive long-term economic and environmental progress.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00600 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Expert opinion exerts tremendous influence on the purchase journey, but its effect on overall consumer experience is ambiguous because it can give rise to both “expectation” and “reputation” effects. This paper explores the effect of expert opinions on consumer experience via the lens of consumer reviews in the restaurant industry, where the expert opinions are conveyed by Michelin stars. The paper uses a unique data set based on the Michelin Guide for Great Britain &amp; Ireland from 2010 to 2020. The data include consumer reviews on TripAdvisor for all restaurants that were awarded Michelin stars during this period and a large pool of potential control restaurants. We apply two synthetic control–based methods to estimate the effect of Michelin star changes on the sentiment and content of consumer reviews. We find that decreases in Michelin stars improve consumer review ratings. We examine three potential explanations for this finding. First, the positive expectation effect of lowered expert opinions outweighs the negative reputation effect. Second, there could be a change in the customer mix. Third, there may be a changes on the supply side, for example, in service levels. We find support for the first explanation, rule out the second, but cannot entirely rule out the third. The analysis of review content further shows that a loss in Michelin stars leads consumers to become less focused on value and become less demanding regarding service. We discuss the implications of our findings for restaurant managers, the Michelin Guide, and other businesses that provide experience goods.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04302 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the consequences of monetizing a marketplace for product promotion within a digital platform, specifically the Giveaways program on Goodreads.com. Using a natural experiment and fine-grained platform data from 2016 to 2020, we examine how introducing a fixed entry cost for content creators affected both supply and demand in this two-sided market. Our findings reveal significant shifts in marketplace dynamics after monetization: (1) a substantial decrease in overall program participation, particularly among indie publishers and self-published authors, leading to increased market concentration; (2) reduced genre diversity, with popular genres becoming more dominant at the expense of niche categories; and (3) intensified promotional effects, characterized by higher review volume but lower average ratings for participating books. Analysis of review text suggests an increase in consumer-book mismatches as a potential mechanism driving this outcome. Our study advances platform economics by demonstrating how entry costs reshape marketplace composition and affect value creation in two-sided markets. These findings inform platform design and policy, particularly for markets with horizontally differentiated products and heterogeneous consumer preferences.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the Dutch national e-infrastructure [Grants 2024/ENW/01764012, EINF-1825, EINF-7628, and EINF-7946] and the European Union [Next Generation EU funds Component M4.C2, Investment 1.1—CUP J53D2300462] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The web appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01390 .</content>

    <title>Game for Brainstorm: The Impact of a Badge System on Knowledge Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-oriented AbstractGamification systems such as badge rewards are widely used to encourage user engagement, yet their effectiveness depends heavily on design. This study investigates how badge volume, variety, and valence—the 3Vs—influence knowledge sharing on platforms such as Stack Overflow. Using a structural hidden Markov model with a copula correction for endogeneity, we uncover that badge volume and valence significantly increase both the quantity and quality of user contributions, particularly among inactive and experienced users. However, excessive variety in badge types reduces long-term engagement, suggesting that diversification may dilute motivational focus. Counterfactual simulations reveal that reducing the difficulty of earning answer badges (“volumizing”) enhances contributions, whereas altering the rarity of high-valence badges (e.g., gold) often backfires. These insights highlight the importance of aligning gamification mechanics with user psychology and engagement trajectories. Practically, platforms can personalize badge offerings, offering easy wins for newcomers and prestige rewards for experienced users. Aligning badge incentives with content goals (e.g., Python questions) and visually showcasing rare badge collections can further deepen engagement. Our findings offer actionable guidance for platform designers to refine gamification systems that balance challenge, recognition, and motivation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using signal detection theory, we meta‐analyzed existing research testing the classification performance of supervised machine learning (ML) models applied in human resource (HR) contexts. Our meta‐analysis contained 6605 effect sizes cross‐nested by study (N1= 249) and unique dataset (N2= 152). We conducted separate cross‐classified multilevel modeling analyses predicting six different classification performance indices. We tested hypotheses regarding the effects of algorithm type, sample size, number of predictors used, the number of outcome classes, and outcome class imbalance on model classification performance. Boosting and random forest algorithms performed best across classification performance indices. However, both come at relatively great computational expense, and solutions can be difficult to explain. Decision trees were the best‐performing algorithms with relatively lower computational expense and easily interpretable solutions. We found limited evidence for the effect of sample size on classification performance. We found stronger support suggesting that using more predictors to train machine learning models results in better classification performance, but only when those predictors have substantive value. Finally, we found strong evidence that outcome class imbalance influences classification performance indices differently. More imbalanced outcome classes are associated with higher accuracy scores, which can be misleading, and lower precision and F1 scores, which may be better estimates of true classification performance. Our findings provide valuable insights into developing ML tools better suited to support HR functions.</content>

    <title>&lt;scp&gt;HPWP&lt;/scp&gt; Climate, Collective Well‐Being, and Firm Performance in &lt;scp&gt;SMEs&lt;/scp&gt;: An Exchange Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on High‐Performance Work Practices (HPWP) typically examines employees' aggregated HPWP perceptions and their impact on organizational outcomes. We argue that variability in these perceptions also matters due to its impact on collective exchange relationships. We integrate the aggregated (mean) level HPWP perceptions and variability regarding HPWP perceptions to identify four HPWP climate types: a strong HPWP climate (high mean, low variability) and three weak HPWP climates—unshared high (high variability, high mean), shared low (low variability, low mean), and unshared low (high variability, low mean). Using data from 695 employees in 72 Belgian SMEs, we find that a strong HPWP climate is optimal as it relates to the highest collective social and lowest economic exchange levels, which are—in turn—associated with high collective affective organizational commitment (CAOC) and subjective firm performance. However, it is also linked to high collective exhaustion, showing that aligning organizational and workforce interests is not always possible. As regards the weak climates, they are suboptimal, with shared low climates being particularly detrimental. Even though these climates can be fruitful for firm performance, they are linked to lower levels of CAOC, which can be harmful for SMEs that rely heavily on the effort and engagement of their employees. These findings show that investing in HPWP is fruitful for SMEs, even though they have limited financial means, and that SMEs also need to handle the inherent tensions present in HRM.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Sourcing Procurement Management: A Closed-Form Mean-Variance Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the post-pandemic era, multi-sourcing is rapidly becoming the preferred approach for companies to drive optimized cost, quality and turnaround times. However, multi-sourcing systems present a myriad of challenges in designing an effective planning model. In this paper, we propose a robust capacity planning model with multiple supply sources, and demonstrate how the capacity plan can be efficiently solved via a parsimonious mean-variance approach. We apply the max-min criterion to design a distributionally robust multi-source capacity plan. We use a new approach to deriving a set of optimality conditions on the robust capacity plan. These conditions enable us to derive the worst distribution, the optimal robust capacity vector, and the worst-case expected profit in closed form. The new approach bypasses numerous tedious intermediate procedures in the traditional distributionally robust optimization literature and allows us to derive the optimal solution based on exogenous cost parameters. This closed-form solution appears to be hitherto unknown and has important ramifications for the multi-sourcing capacity planning problem. Our findings reveal that, despite the complexity of multi-sourcing, the worst-case demand scenario can be reduced to justn+ 1 distinct outcomes, structured by two key sequences derived from supplier characteristics. The optimal capacity plan has a clear structure–allocations align with the midpoints between these demand scenarios. Surprisingly, we also find that most of the robustness benefits of a full supplier portfolio can be achieved by engaging just the two best-matched sources. This provides a practical and cost-effective road map for robust capacity planning in multi-sourcing environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of memory on economic choices can be essential, but empirical evidence of the link between them remains scarce. This study examines whether the retrieval of memories related to economic recessions affects the changes in the bias in management forecasts. Using the 2008 financial crisis as a memory trigger and focusing on annual management earnings forecasts issued for fiscal years ending between 2002 and 2018, we find that chief executive officers (CEOs) with more long-term memories of leading through past recessions and those with more intense recent memories of the financial crisis embed greater pessimism in their forecasts after the financial crisis. These findings support the retrieved-context theory in human memory as well as the availability heuristic and the recency effect in psychology. Further analyses show that it takes about three years for the increased pessimism in management forecasts to return to the pre-crisis level, mainly for CEOs with more memories of past recessions. These findings suggest that memory retrieval may delay managers’ learning after the financial crisis. Our study offers new insights into the role that memory plays in managers’ decision making.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04053 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rent‐to‐own (RTO) firms rent products for a periodic fee and allow a renter to buy the rented product at specified buyout prices during the rental. Accurately capturing the renters' decision process, as well as their ownership and rental utilities, is required for determining their willingness to pay buyout prices in different periods. We develop a modular framework that cleanly separates solving a renter's decision problem from estimating utility. We consider renters with varying degrees of sophistication and alertness to buyout offers. Using washer, dryer, and mattress data from a prominent RTO firm, for each decision model, we estimate utilities and the probabilities of abandoning the rental, neglecting the buyout offer, and considering the buyout offer. We find that renters have short decision horizons and frequently neglect buyout offers. Also, their utilities remain stable throughout the rentals. Moreover, renters who opt for rental agreements with higher rental fees or longer terms tend to have higher ownership utilities. Based on our counterfactual analyses, for washer or dryer renters, we suggest initiating efforts to remind renters of buyout offers. In contrast, for mattresses, whose renters more frequently consider buyout offers, we find that profits would be increased by setting prices higher.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Executive compensation is a key topic in management research, focusing on how firms use incentives to align CEOs’ decisions with shareholders’ interests. Yet, we know little about the influence of stock-option compensation—a major component of CEO pay—on CEO decisions facing adverse events involving multiple stakeholders. Analyzing U.S. medical device recalls between 2004 and 2017, we examine how stock options induce CEOs to protect their existing wealth while pursuing potential gains. We find that CEOs with greater current option wealth are more likely to adopt short-term impression management (IM) tactics, such as strategically timing recalls and maintaining silence in press releases, which can harm shareholders and stakeholders. In contrast, CEOs with higher prospective option wealth are less inclined to employ these tactics. Moreover, negative media scrutiny discourages CEOs with substantial current option wealth from using IM tactics, and encourages those with greater prospective option wealth to further avoid them. These findings highlight the powerful role of executive compensation, particularly stock options, in shaping CEO decisions facing adverse events.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on an exemplary case of strategic HRM in a nonprofit social care provider responding to a recruitment and retention crisis, this article offers evidence for a multi‐actor, recursive model of HRM implementation. We examine how multi‐actor engagement with strategic HRM reinforces or modifies intended HRM, and how this engagement is shaped by external and internal contextual pressures in nonprofit social care organizations. Through an in‐depth qualitative study, we shed light on the internal process dynamics that not only engender a shared understanding of intended HRM strategy and practice among key organizational actors (convergence) but also allow for local deviation (divergence) that forges a more adequate response to workforce challenges. Our study contributes to theory on the social dynamics of HRM implementation within wider institutional contexts while highlighting the limits of a business‐oriented HRM system for delivering a sustainable workforce within social care.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal and Self Selection of Service Type in a Queueing System where Long Service Postpones the Need for the Next Service</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a make-to-order system with a finite set of customers. Production is stochastic with a nonlinear dependence between the ordered quantity and the production rate. Customers may have to queue until their turn arrives, and therefore their order decisions interact. Specifically, while being served, customers are aware of the queue length and choose one of two order quantities (or service types). The time to the next replenishment (their activity time) is stochastic and depends on the order quantities. A customer is inactive during service and while waiting in the queue. We refer to the type of service with a greater ratio of expected activity to service time as “more efficient”. In the centralized case, the system is interested in maximizing the steady-state average number of active customers, which is referred to as the efficiency of the system. We show that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal, but the optimal strategy can be approximated well by selecting one of three threshold strategies which depend on the number of inactive customers. In the decentralized case, each customer acts to maximize the fraction of time she is active. We observe that individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: When the queue is long, individuals tend to choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short service in this case. This makes the system difficult to regulate. However, we show that simply removing the less efficient service significantly increases efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of a replenishment recommendation system on inventory management in convenience stores. We collaborate with a convenience store chain to implement the system in some locations while leaving others unchanged. We find that the introduction of the system increases reorder points and reduces order size, leading to a 2.9% improvement in service levels without requiring additional inventory and without negatively affecting sales or revenue. Additionally, it reduces managers’ daily ordering time by 36.5%, thus enhancing overall store efficiency. Our study also highlights the important role of managerial discretion in complementing the system. For popular items, managers often adjust recommendations by placing orders ahead of any recommendations or increasing the recommended quantity. Interview with managers suggests that they override in anticipation of demand increases that the system has yet to detect. For non-popular items, given their slow-moving nature, managers are more likely to postpone recommendations due to concerns over excess inventory. Our study demonstrates that, for small retailers without the resources to invest in advanced algorithms, even a basic moving average algorithm can be effective by allowing managerial discretion to complement the algorithm in responding to demand fluctuations. This also underscores the need to enhance recommendation accuracy for both top-selling items, given their significant contribution to sales, and the typically overlooked less-popular items due to their slow-moving nature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice ModelingChoice modeling is an important topic that underlies a wide range of applications involving human decision making, and it traces its roots to the 1920s. Matrix balancing has an equally long history and wide applicability (e.g., in transportation and mobility networks). Recently, its celebrated Sinkhorn’s algorithm has been instrumental in the efficient approximation of optimal transport distances. However, the two topics have largely developed independently. In “On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice Modeling,” Qu, Galichon, Gao, and Ugander establish extensive connections between a class of Luce choice models and a common matrix-balancing problem. They leverage these connections to resolve open problems on the convergence of Sinkhorn’s algorithm for nonnegative matrices, characterizing its global linear convergence rate in terms of the algebraic connectivity and deriving the sharp asymptotic rate. The connections established in this paper between two seemingly unrelated topics help the transmission of ideas and lead to further interesting results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines whether and how politicians’ ideologies influence corporate taxation. Our tests exploit the implementation of the 1978 Reform and Opening-up policy in China that significantly weakens the communist ideology. Using textual analyses of city secretaries’ speeches, we first establish that secretaries who joined the communist party after 1978 have a weaker communist ideology. We next show that, in the postreform period, firms in cities whose secretaries joined the communist party after 1978 have significantly lower effective tax rates than those of firms with secretaries joining the communist party beforehand. Further analyses reveal that tax benefit provisions and tax enforcement are the mechanisms through which secretaries’ ideologies influence corporate taxation.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [General Research Fund 17502219].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing rivalry research finds that people try harder and perform better when competing against their rivals. However, are there conditions under which rivalry can harm performance? We integrate rivalry theory with regulatory fit theory to propose two moderators of rivalry: individual skill and situational risk for status change. We test our predictions using data from software programming contests involving more than 4.6 million competitive encounters across 16,846 software developers (“coders”) to examine the causal effects of rivalry and the conditions under which it may backfire. We find that, on average, coders who are randomly assigned to compete against a field of competitors with whom they share a rivalrous history exhibit higher performance, above and beyond other established drivers of performance in competition. Importantly, however, this positive effect of rivalry is moderated by (1) coders’ skill level, such that rivalry is more beneficial for more skilled coders and is harmful for less skilled coders, and (2) coders’ risk of experiencing a status change, such that coders who face a possible status loss exhibit decreased performance when competing against rivals. Thus, we extend research on rivalry by revealing the conditions under which it can harm performance, which is vital to understanding its role in organizations.This paper was accepted by Sameer Srivastava, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00344 .</content>

    <title>Does Speculation in Futures Markets Improve Commodity Hedging Decisions?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of traditional versus selective hedging strategies in commodity futures markets. Traditional hedging aims solely to reduce spot price risk, whereas selective hedging also seeks to enhance returns by predicting movements in commodity futures prices. We construct selective hedges using a range of forecasting techniques, from simple historical averages to advanced machine learning models, and evaluate their performance based on the expected mean-variance utility of hedge portfolio returns. Out-of-sample results for 24 commodities do not favor selective hedging over traditional hedging as the former increases risk without delivering additional returns. These findings are robust across various hedge reformulations, expanding estimation windows, and rebalancing frequencies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This research was supported by grants from Audencia Business School and Auckland University of Technology, awarded during A.

    <title>Too Much, Too Soon, for Too Long: The Dynamics of Competitive Executive Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine executive compensation in a general equilibrium model with dynamic moral hazard, where executives' outside options are endogenously determined by equilibrium market compensation. Firms provide incentives through compensation packages featuring deferred payments as “carrots” and termination as “sticks.” Crucially, the effectiveness of termination as an incentive device is undermined by the outside options available to executives. As individual firms fail to internalize the effect of their compensation design on these endogenous outside options, the equilibrium is generally inefficient. Compared to shareholder‐value‐maximizing compensation packages, executives are paid too much, too soon, and keep their jobs for too long.</content>

    <title>Near-Histories and Strategy Emergence: A Microhistorical Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even when anticipated strategic decisions or actions do not materialize, they can still set in motion emergent dynamics with collateral consequences that lead to profound strategic consequences. Adopting a microhistorical lens, we elucidate the dynamics of these processes by focusing on two largely dismissed near-history episodes in the relatively recent history of the Nokia Corporation. We develop a process model that elaborates on how anticipatory reactions, mobilization of networks, revision of expectations, and the emergence of a new strategic direction can eventually have significant strategic consequences. By focusing on this poorly understood but important form of strategy emergence, we contribute to a fuller understanding of strategy emergence and the role of strategic agency therein. Furthermore, we extend the conversation on near-histories from focusing on what could have happened to examining their concrete consequences. Our findings show that near-history episodes are not merely precursors or impediments to actualized events but productive forces shaping organizational trajectories in ways that realized events alone cannot explain. In so doing, our microhistorical analysis has major methodological implications for historically oriented strategy research and for our understanding of causal complexity in strategy emergence.</content>

    <title>Estimating Welfare Effects in a Nonparametric Choice Model: The Case of School Vouchers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop new robust discrete choice tools to learn about the average willingness to pay for a price subsidy and its effects on demand given exogenous, discrete variation in prices. Our starting point is a nonparametric, nonseparable model of choice. We exploit the insight that our welfare parameters in this model can be expressed as functions of demand for the different alternatives. However, while the variation in the data reveals the value of demand at the observed prices, the parameters generally depend on its values beyond these prices. We show how to sharply characterize what we can learn when demand is specified to be entirely nonparametric or to be parameterized in a flexible manner, both of which imply that the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We use our tools to analyze the welfare effects of price subsidies provided by school vouchers in the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. We find that the provision of the status quo voucher and a wide range of counterfactual vouchers of different amounts can have positive and potentially large benefits net of costs. The positive effect can be explained by the popularity of low-tuition schools in the program; removing them from the program can result in a negative net benefit. We also find that various standard logit specifications, in comparison, limit attention to demand functions with low demand for the voucher, which do not capture the large magnitudes of benefits credibly consistent with the data.</content>

    <title>Reallocative Auctions and Core Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When selling goods like wireless spectrum or electricity contracts, designers often opt for core-selecting mechanisms—i.e., those that induce outcomes in the core—in order to balance revenue and efficiency goals. But increasingly, auctions—such as the FCC's Incentive Auction and those explored for natural resources—seek to reallocate goods, not just sell them. We show that when bidders can both buy and sell, substitutability among goods is no longer sufficient or necessary for core selection. In particular, in these environments, core selection can fail even with a single good and positive revenue, and can succeed even when some or all bidders view goods as complements. Instead, we show that the key feature that determines core selection is heterogeneity among the bidders. With too much heterogeneity, reallocation mostly realizes pre-existing gains from trade among the bidders, and core selection fails. With limited heterogeneity, most gains from trade among the bidders are created by the quantity auctioned, and a core-selecting mechanism is possible.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Hidden Fees to Open Books: An Empirical Examination of the Impact of Hospital Price Transparency Rule on Costs and Quality of Medical Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, the lack of competition within the healthcare market is notably influenced by the opacity of service pricing, leading to unchecked price increases without improvements in service quality. The hospital price transparency rule, implemented on January 1, 2021, seeks to address this by requiring the disclosure of prices, aiming to stimulate competition and lower costs. Yet, the policy’s effect on hospital charges and consumer behavior remains largely unexplored. This study employs a difference-in-differences analysis of inpatient data from Florida hospitals to assess the impact of the Federal price transparency rule on hospital charges and patient decision-making, leveraging the phased compliance of hospitals with the rule.Our analysis reveals that while the price transparency rule does not broadly reduce hospital charges, it leads to lower charges for self-pay patients opting for elective procedures who are sensitive to price and can shop for better deals. This reduction is driven by both lower unit prices and decreased care complexity as hospitals compete to attract cost-conscious patients. Furthermore, our findings indicate that after the implementation of the policy, patients choose hospitals that not only comply with the rule but also charge below the market average, particularly benefiting those seeking elective services. This suggests that price transparency primarily aids cost-aware patients with the flexibility to choose more affordable providers. Our research underscores the nuanced impact of price transparency on healthcare costs and patient welfare, offering valuable insights for future healthcare policy development.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: On Matching Efficiency in Online Labor Markets for IT Services: The Role of Project Description</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many online labor markets face challenges in matching service providers with employers because of the high uncertainty in online environments compared to traditional ones. While prior studies have mostly focused on the uncertainty that employers face with service providers, our study explores the uncertainty service providers face when selecting projects on which to bid. Specifically, our study examines the role of project description in the Call for Bids (CFB) that describes the services requested by employers, in shaping service providers’ bidding behavior and the matching between service providers and employers. Drawing upon transaction cost economics, we examine three key dimensions of project descriptions: (a)codifiability(provisions of detailed procedures), (b)flexibility(provisions of renegotiation opportunities), and (c) provisions ofoutcome standards. We first use machine learning to quantify the three key dimensions based on unstructured textual information. Second, we use Bayesian mediation analysis and a randomized experiment to examine the role of these three key dimensions in matching efficiency and to explore the mediating role of three key bid attributes (i.e., number of bids, average price of bids, average quality of bids). Findings reveal:First, codifiability is positively associated with matching efficiency by reducing the number of bids received by employers.Second, flexibility is negatively associated with matching efficiency by raising the average price of bids.Third, outcome standards are positively linked to matching efficiency by reducing the number, albeit improving the average quality, of bids. By focusing on the project description and analyzing the textual content of CFB, our study contributes to the literature by enhancing the matching efficiency of online labor markets and facilitating the contracting of IT services in online labor markets.</content>

    <title>A Ridesharing Platform with an Oversupply of Drivers: Different Assigning Rates or Commission Rates for Drivers?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a ridesharing platform's choice among two quality-dependent compensation schemes for drivers when the market is oversupplied, that is, there are more drivers than riders at a given time. We examine an information asymmetric context in which drivers (high and low cost) have different costs to improve service quality, which is private information. The platform designs a menu of contracts for drivers to reveal their type. In the assigning-differentiation compensation scheme, the platform offers contract options with different assigning rates, that is, the probability of receiving an order assignment, different service-quality levels, but the same commission rate. In the commission-differentiation compensation scheme, the platform offers contract options with different commission rates, different service-quality levels, but the same assigning rate. We find that the oversupply degree, measured as the ratio of the number of drivers to the number of riders, plays a critical role in the platform's choice of scheme. The platform's expected profit is higher under the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when the oversupply degree is high (low). We also determine the effect of the driver-type distribution on the platform's choice of scheme. When the difference in the drivers’ costs is small, the platform is more likely to choose the commission-differentiation scheme when there are more high-cost drivers. When the cost difference is large, first, the platform is more (less) likely to choose the commission-differentiation (assigning-differentiation) scheme, but then, it is more (less) likely to choose the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when there are more high-cost drivers. Further, high-cost drivers are indifferent to either compensation scheme, whereas low-cost drivers are better off under the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when the oversupply degree is low (high). In addition, we find that both the platform and (low-cost) drivers prefer the assigning-differentiation scheme, a win-win outcome under certain conditions. Finally, we show that the platform can provide a subsidy to mitigate potential misalignment with the drivers.</content>

    <title>Not Good Enough, but Try Again! The Impact of Improved Rejection Communications on Contributor Retention and Performance in Open Knowledge Collaboration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Producing high-quality content through open knowledge collaboration presents a dilemma. Successful quality control requires rejecting contributions that do not align with the aims of an open knowledge collaboration system, yet rejections demotivate new contributors from attempting further contributions. Building on research on the regulation of behavior in online communities and on organizational selection, we theorize how the way rejections are communicated affect new contributors. We leverage a change to the rejection notices used by the Stack Overflow community question-answering service to study the issue empirically. First, we use a regression discontinuity in time design to construct a natural experiment to estimate the average treatment effect of more informative rejection notices on the retention of initially rejected contributors. The results show that notices that better explain the reason for rejecting a contributor’s initial question—and therefore reduce uncertainty about the outcome if the contributor tries again—increase retention by approximately 21.7 percentage points. Second, we use a mediation model to study mechanisms by which more informative rejection notices affect contributor performance. We find that more informative notices affect contributor performance through selection rather than performance improvement. Additional contributors, who are retained because of the more informative rejection notices, ask more questions, on average, whereas we find no evidence of individual contributors improving their performance in terms of the quality or quantity of their contributions. Overall, the results suggest that rejection communications offer low-cost interventions to mitigate the trade-off between new contributor retention and the quality of contributions in open knowledge collaboration.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the Fox School of Business, Temple University (Young Scholar Interdisciplinary Forum) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02720 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Different Effects of Mass-Media Marketing and Personal Sales Budgets across the Life Cycle of B2B High-Tech Start-ups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In their early life-cycle stages, business-to-business (B2B) high-tech start-ups face severe challenges in establishing their first customer relationships. To generate business growth, they must convey the value of unfamiliar, innovative, complex offerings to customers, using the limited resources at their disposal. Prior research has not examined the different roles of mass-media marketing and personal sales communications in this challenging endeavor, despite principal differences between these activities in start-up contexts. To help B2B high-tech start-ups allocate financial resources to mass-media marketing and personal sales communications across early and later stages of their organizational life cycle, this article presents a longitudinal survey study involving founders of B2B high-tech start-ups. The findings indicate that start-ups spending a larger share of their budget on personal sales (i.e., higher personal sales expense ratio) exhibit stronger performance in earlier stages of their life cycle but weaker performance in later stages; however, still in later stages, these expenditures enhance certain performance metrics. Conversely, start-ups spending a larger share of their budget on mass-media marketing (i.e., higher mass-media marketing expense ratio) show stronger performance in later stages but weaker performance in earlier stages. High-tech start-ups can leverage these findings to improve their budget allocation and ensure persistent growth.</content>

    <title>A Review of Market Categorization Research: An Evolutionary Framework Across Perspectives and Stages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market categorization—the process of grouping organizations perceived as sharing core attributes and serving similar demand profiles—has become a central topic in management research, offering a theoretically rich and interdisciplinary domain of study. Scholars have examined how market categories form, develop, and decline, drawing from structural, strategic, and constructionist perspectives to explore their role in shaping firms, industries, and institutions. Despite substantial advancements, research on market categorization remains fragmented, leading to inconsistent conceptualizations, theoretical isolation, and a lack of cross-stage integration. Studies often focus on individual stages while neglecting their interconnections or apply discipline-specific lenses that limit theoretical synthesis and hinder the accumulation of knowledge. To address these gaps, we conducted a systematic review of 195 articles published between 1999 and 2024, synthesizing insights across stages and perspectives to develop an evolutionary framework of market categorization. Our analysis identifies three cross-perspective mechanisms—categories as constraints, enablers, and actor-shaped entities—that underpin categorization processes and explain their underlying dynamics. In addition, by conceptualizing transitions between categorization stages, we provide a unified foundation for future research. This evolutionary perspective clarifies the role of market categorization in shaping economic and organizational landscapes while bridging theoretical divides and guiding future empirical inquiry.</content>

    <title>Leader Anthropomorphizing Behavior Toward Robots: Conceptualization, Measurement, and Implications for Perceived Objectification and Workplace Deviance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As robots become more integrated into the workplace, leaders are increasingly engaging in behaviors that anthropomorphize robots. Given that this form of leader behavior remains undertheorized, we conceptualize it as leader anthropomorphizing behavior toward robots (LABR)—an observable behavior through which leaders endow robots with human-like characteristics. Although practical wisdom and previous studies have highlighted a prevailing optimism about adopting LABR to manage human–robot teams, such optimism may be premature. Drawing on objectification theory, we develop a model that uncovers the detrimental effects of LABR on employees who observe such behavior. To test our model, we developed and validated a LABR scale (Study 1) and conducted five subsequent studies (Studies 2a–5) using vignette-based experiments and field surveys. The results showed that employees who observed LABR were more likely to perceive themselves as being objectified by their leaders, which in turn increased their likelihood of engaging in workplace deviance. By theorizing LABR and revealing its potential dark sides, we contribute to the literature on leader behavior, robot anthropomorphism, human–robot teams, and objectification.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing the performance of intralogistics operations, that is logistics operations within facilities such as manufacturing plants, order fulfillment warehouses, ports and terminals, and retail stores, is critical in fulfilling customer expectations. Traditional decision-making for intralogistics operations is based on historical data, typically collected over long-range intervals with significant processing delays. However, nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) applications are used to gather detailed real-time data to make dynamic decisions. These new data sources provide challenges and opportunities for operations management. We provide an overview of prominent IoT technologies in four domains: Manufacturing, warehousing, ports and terminals, retail, and other emerging areas. We discuss four prominent research questions (cutting across multiple application domains) that can be addressed using new data sources, along with the methodological approach and managerial insights that may result. In particular, IoT can improve the tracking and tracing of objects, equipment, and humans and provide rapid alerts, allowing managers to make real-time decisions and improve asset use, uptime, and profitability.</content>

    <title>When Newspapers Fail to Deter Corporate Illegality: The Constraining Effects of Economic Institutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents aim to restrict corporate illegality, yet its prevalence highlights inconsistencies in enforcement mechanisms. To explore this issue, we examine how newspapers reduce corporate illegality by imposing ethical norms on firms. Analysing data from firms in 29 countries, we find that higher newspaper reach is only moderately associated with lower levels of corporate illegality due to key boundary conditions. Specifically, we leverage institutional anomie theory as a framework to identify and test three ways in which economic institutions constrain newspapers' ethical norm‐setting role. The negative association between newspaper reach and corporate illegality is weakened in countries with strong cultural pressure to succeed or pervasive economic penetration into newspapers. However, firm‐level shareholder orientation does not moderate this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized analyses of media landscapes and the role of economic institutions in undermining social control processes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study analyzes 6 million civil judgments in China from 2014 to 2018, documenting gender disparities that disfavor female litigants. We investigate the impact of an open justice reform that mandated courts to broadcast legal proceedings live on a centralized online platform. By exploiting variations in its implementation across courts and over time and employing both difference-in-differences and Bartik IV approaches, we find that gender disparities in chances of winning decrease as broadcast intensity increases. Analysis of the textual content of judicial decisions provides further evidence that these changes in judicial outcomes stem from altered judge behaviors (i.e., attention and effort) under enhanced judicial transparency. Our results demonstrate how information technology shapes judges’ conduct, underscoring its broader potential to improve accountability in public institutions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers introducing asymmetric privacy in the design of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and digital currencies more generally to preserve the privacy of money spent while keeping the benefits of digital records for money received. It is shown that this feature would help minimize real distortions between consumers, firms, and financiers while enabling tax optimization and better access to external financing. Protecting the privacy of consumers is desirable from a welfare and efficiency standpoint as long as there exist noticeable privacy concerns. Implementing asymmetric privacy is technologically feasible, using, for instance, zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy tools.This paper has been accepted by Lin William Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06830 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Passive bond funds provide predictable demand for newly issued corporate bonds included in popular indices. By issuing index-eligible bonds, firms can take advantage of this passive demand and improve bond characteristics unrelated to index eligibility. To this end, firms issue a disproportionate number of bonds with face value just sufficient to be included in major bond indices. Higher passive demand is associated with larger bonds. Following an increase in the index size threshold, some firms withdraw from the bond market while others respond by issuing larger bonds at the new threshold.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01999 .</content>

    <title>Third-Party Software Development Kit Utilization and Mobile App Market Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the highly competitive mobile market, third-party vendors located outside the purview of hosting mobile platforms are becoming major suppliers of functional tool kits for mobile app development and innovation. However, app developers face challenges in navigating the use of third-party software development kits (SDKs) to enhance app performance. Drawing on the platform ecosystem literature, this study examines the roles of third-party SDKs, platform owners, and mobile app developers from a boundary-spanning perspective, emphasizing their respective contributions to shaping the functional value of third-party SDKs as boundary objects. By analyzing a longitudinal data set of 335,958 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play, we find that integrating more third-party SDKs can significantly boost daily active users, especially when tool-type SDKs are utilized. However, this positive effect diminishes following platform updates that redefine platform boundaries and as developers gain more platform-specific experience. This study highlights the importance of balanced governance in platform ecosystems to sustain market growth, offering actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and industry leaders in shaping the future of mobile app markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School districts historically approached conflict resolution from the perspective that suspending disruptive students was necessary to protect their classmates, even if this caused harm to perceived offenders. Restorative practices (RP)—focusing on reparation, accountability, and shared ownership of disciplinary justice—are designed to address undesirable behavior without harming students. We study Chicago Public Schools’ adoption of RP and find that suspensions and arrests decreased, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test score value added, ruling out meaningful average declines. We estimate a 15 percent decrease in out-of-school arrests, consistent with RP substantively changing student behavior. (JEL D63, D74, D91, I21, I28, J15, J16)</content>

    <title>Monopsony and Employer Misoptimization Explain Why Wages Bunch at Round Numbers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that administrative hourly wage data exhibit considerable bunching at round numbers. We run two experiments randomizing wages around $0.10 and $1.00 to experimentally measure left-digit bias for identical tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk; we fail to find any evidence of discontinuity in the labor supply function at round numbers despite estimating a considerable degree of monopsony. We replicate these results in administrative worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon. We can rule out inattention estimates found in the behavioral product market literature. We provide evidence that firms “misoptimize” wage setting. More monopsony requires less employer misoptimization to explain bunching. (JEL D22, J22, J31, J42)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the employer's role in unemployment insurance (UI) take-up. Employer effects on claiming and appeals are substantial, and those effects are negatively correlated, consistent with appeals deterring claims. Low-wage workers are less likely to claim and more likely to have their claims appealed than median-wage workers. Employer effects help explain these income gradients, so equalizing employer effects on claiming would increase the progressivity of UI. Finally, the main source of targeting error in UI is that eligible workers do not claim. (JEL J22, J31, J63, J64, J65)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists routinely make functional form assumptions on demand curves to derive welfare conclusions. How sensitive are these conclusions to such assumptions? In this paper, we develop robustness measures that quantify the extent to which the true demand curve must deviate from common functional form assumptions in order to overturn a welfare conclusion. We parametrize this variability in terms of the gradient and curvature of the demand curve. By leveraging tools from information design, we show that our measures are easy to compute. Our measures are also flexible and easy to use, as we illustrate through empirical applications. (JEL D01, D60, F13, H55, Q48)</content>

    <title>Direct and Indirect Effects of Investment Tax Incentives</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the direct effects and indirect spillover effects of investment tax credits on firms. Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm's investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects. (JEL D22, H25, H32, J23, L25, L60, R11)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a randomized trial among 14,545 households in rural Burkina Faso to test the oft-cited hypothesis that limited access to contraception is an important driver of high fertility rates in West Africa. We do not find support for this hypothesis. Women who were given free access to modern contraception for three years did not have lower birth rates; we can reject even modest effects. We cross-randomized additional interventions to address inefficiencies that might depress demand for free contraception, specifically misperceptions about the child mortality rate and social norms. Free contraception did not significantly influence fertility even in combination with these interventions. (JEL D12, J13, J16, J18, O12)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Common values auction models, where bidder decisions depend on noisy signals of common values, provide predictions about Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes. In settings where these common values can be estimated, these predictions can be tested. We propose a series of tests, robust to assumptions about the signal structure, to determine whether the observed data could have been generated by a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In the setting of oil and gas lease auctions in New Mexico, we find evidence that participation decisions are correlated and that participants systematically underbid in light of ex post outcomes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study changes in political discourse during campaigns, using a novel dataset of candidate websites for US House elections, 2002–2016, and manifestos for French parliamentary and local elections, 1958–2022. We find that candidates move to the center in ideology and rhetorical complexity between the first round (or primary) and the second round (or general election). This convergence reflects candidates’ strategic adjustment to their opponents, as predicted by Downsian competition: Using an RDD we show that candidates converge to the platform of opponents who narrowly qualified for the last round as opposed to those who narrowly failed to qualify.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Accelerated investment in electricity transmission could reduce total costs and enhance renewable integration. I document static allocative inefficiencies induced by incomplete market integration in 2 major US markets; these have risen over time and totaled $2 billion in 2022. I also argue that estimating firm-level impacts is important, as incumbents may have the power to block new lines and other reforms. I show that 4 firms would have experienced a collective $1.3 billion drop in net revenues in 2022 had the market been integrated, and there are reports of some of these firms blocking transmission projects.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Galí (2014) showed that a monetary policy rule that raises rates when bubbles exceed some steady-state benchmark can paradoxically lead to larger deviations from steady state. Nevertheless, this comment shows that a central bank can always dampen a bubble by setting a higher-than-expected rate, although it may have to raise the rate aggressively. This is a different point from the Miao, Shen, and Wang (2019) comment on Galí (2014). They showed that when the central bank targets a different steady state than Galí considered, raising rates when bubbles exceed this alternative benchmark leads to smaller deviations from steady state.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a framework to extend the strategic form analysis of cursed equilibrium (CE) developed by Eyster and Rabin (2005) to multistage games. The approach uses behavioral strategies rather than normal form mixed strategies and imposes sequential rationality. We define and characterize properties of cursed sequential equilibrium (CSE) and apply it to four canonical economic applications: signaling games, reputation building, durable goods monopoly, and the dirty faces game. These applications illustrate various implications of CSE, show how and why it differs from sequential equilibrium and CE, and provide evidence from laboratory experiments that support the empirical relevance of CSE.

    <title>Decoupling Firm Growth From Carbon Emissions: A Supply Network Role Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To achieve meaningful progress in carbon neutrality, absolute carbon emissions must be reduced. One possible approach is to decouple firms' growth trajectories from their emissions. Adopting a supply network perspective, this study examines how firms in different network roles decouple their growth from carbon emissions across all scopes. Focusing on the aerospace and defense industry's supply network, we apply an ego‐temporal exponential random graph model (ego‐TERGM) to empirically infer four previously conceptualized firm roles—negotiator, orchestrator, executor, and compromiser—based on structural and nodal characteristics. The findings of our exploratory analysis reveal significant differences in decoupling performance: the firms in roles characterized by denser ego networks decouple more effectively, while those in roles characterized by central and monopolistic positions tend to perform worse. These differences reflect the influence of power dynamics and network dependencies on firms' decoupling abilities. Central firms must navigate complex demands, while those in denser network roles experience stronger normative pressures to conform to sustainable practices. Beyond these network effects, decoupling can be further supported by setting more ambitious emissions targets, adopting moderate growth strategies, and prioritizing environmental innovation.</content>

    <title>Developing Generative AI for Value Co‐Creation: An Intervention‐Based Randomized Field Experiment in a Healthcare Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Owing to limited healthcare resources, there has been increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) interventions to treat mental health problems of chronic disease patients in developing countries. However, it is challenging to overcome the AI trust crisis in the healthcare context and develop AI that improves the patient's personalized experience and the quality of care. Elaborating on the value co‐creation theory using an actor–network theory (ANT) approach, this study examines how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can improve post‐discharge care for patients with cardiovascular disease in resource‐limited settings. Using an intervention‐based research approach in collaboration with a major hospital in China, researchers co‐designed a GenAI intervention with potential users and various stakeholders. Through a randomized controlled trial, we further evaluated the impact of a co‐created GenAI intervention on the post‐discharge self‐confidence and quality of care of 114 patients. Compared with the standard post‐discharge care process, chronically ill patients who received the GenAI intervention experienced a 6.049‐point (out of a total of 80 points) decrease in state anxiety and an 87.8% decrease in the 30‐day readmission risk. The insights gained from the intervention process, as interpreted using the ANT approach, expand the generic framework of value co‐creation to include a more GenAI‐mediated network of human and non‐human objects. Results reveal GenAI's boundary‐spanning and integrating roles as a critical node in the emerging, dynamic, value‐creating actor network. The inclusion of “a nonparticipant observe” allows us to offer cognitive explanations for why GenAI works. Overall, this study contributes to healthcare operations management by designing a process for developing and implementing GenAI to improve healthcare operations.</content>

    <title>Toward a Property Rights Theory of the Family Firm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using property rights theory to examine the characteristics that enable family firms to exclude rivals from their competitive space, we explain why the family form of governance is often selected instead of the nonfamily form of governance and what determines the scale and scope of family firms. Family-centered nonpecuniary goals allow family firms to capture rights to common property opportunities that nonfamily firms find unattractive. Furthermore, the development and deployment of non-tradeable, immobile, inimitable, and indivisible human and nonhuman resources enable family firms to protect their property rights from competitors. Finally, because family members act as owners and managers, family firm governance can reduce the cost of monitoring as well as the possibility of opportunistic behavior and underinvestment of family resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the establishment of public audit oversight bodies (POBs) worldwide. We present descriptive evidence on POBs’ characteristics and factors influencing the timing of their establishment, finding that countries with stronger institutions, civil law traditions, and higher media attention to audit quality adopt POBs faster. While countries may choose similar POB design features, these choices do not align with the factors driving adoption speed. We also explore whether the finding of a positive impact on audit quality of the U.S. PCAOB generalizes to other countries. A difference‐in‐differences analysis over 20 years provides some evidence that POB establishment and their characteristics improve audit quality. However, the results appear sensitive to audit quality measures and research design. Our study offers the first broad‐based investigation of POB adoption and provides important nuance on the relation between POBs and audit quality.</content>
