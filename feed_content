    <title>Are less hierarchical firms organized around stronger cultures? Evidence from big data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are less hierarchical firms organized around stronger cultures instead? We analyze 1.5 million employee reviews on Glassdoor.com from 23,000 US‐based firms, alongside data on managerial hierarchy estimated from 42 million professional social media profiles. Our findings confirm a negative association between managerial hierarchy and organizational culture strength. We explore two potential explanations for this association: Functional equivalence between the two, and culture fragmentation caused by managerial hierarchy. Multiple correlational tests show support for functional equivalence as a plausible explanation for the observed negative correlation. Our findings enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between organizational structure and culture utilizing Big Data methods.Managerial SummaryCan strong cultures, i.e., systems of widely shared beliefs and values converging on a few organizational dimensions, be an alternative to managerial hierarchy to align the work of employees? Our analysis of 1.5 million Glassdoor employee reviews and 42 million professional profiles from 23,000 U.S. firms shows  that organizations with stronger cultures do indeed have a lower fraction of managers to total employees. This suggests that attempts to “flatten” hierarchies by eliminating layers of managers is more likely to succeed if accompanied by efforts to build strong cultures, through mechanisms such as careful selection and socialization of workers.</content>

    <title>Banning Unsolicited Store Flyers: Does Helping the Environment Hurt Retailing?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a ban on unsolicited store flyers in seven Dutch municipalities that shifted from an opt-out to an opt-in policy between 2018 and 2020. Despite a 50% drop in flyer distribution, household grocery shopping behavior remained largely unchanged. The findings suggest that reducing flyer waste may be possible without substantially disrupting shopping behavior.</content>

    <title>On Greedy-Like Policies in Online Matching with Reusable Network Resources and Decaying Rewards</title>
    <updated>2025-10-14T13:39:15+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>David Simchi-Levi, Zeyu Zheng, Feng Zhu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a unified modeling framework for classical online matching problems and emerging online matching problems with three additional practical features: reusable resources, network resources, and decaying rewards. For online matching problems in the unified framework, we provide a unified performance analysis tool for the greedy policy and its simple variants, which we refer to as greedy-like policies. We prove that greedy-like policies can achieve near-optimal performances for online matching problems in the unified framework, where the policy performance is measured by competitive ratios under adversarial environments. We then analyze several representative special classes of online matching problems, which incorporate additional realistic structural assumptions on top of the unified framework. Specifically, we consider online matching problems with each of the following three additional structures: (i) singleton resources with time-decaying rewards; (ii) network resources with accept/reject decisions; and (iii) network resources with interval-type bundles. We show that for these special classes of online matching problems, slight modifications to greedy-like policies can successfully utilize additional structural information to further enhance policy performances. This work may suggest that the greedy policy and its variants, despite its simplicity, can achieve reliable performances for a number of emerging online matching problems.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>How Do Domestic and Foreign Firms Respond to a Reduction in Competition from the Public Sector? Evidence from Vaccine Markets in India</title>
    <updated>2025-10-14T13:39:15+00:00</updated>

      <name>Arzi Adbi, Anant Mishra, Chirantan Chatterjee</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how domestic and foreign firms in the private sector respond to a reduction in competition from the public sector. Our analysis exploits the sudden suspension of production licenses of vaccine-manufacturing public sector units (PSUs) in January 2008 in India, home to more than 1.2 billion people at that time. Although the suspension presented a window of opportunity for private sector firms, the opportunity was laden with high uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we find that the suspension was associated with revenue gains driven by new product introductions and that these gains persist even after the supply suspension revocation in February 2010. Importantly, unlike domestic firms, foreign firms gain little. We explore potential mechanisms and find evidence consistent with one of them being the major reason for the differing impact: Domestic firms better navigate the challenges arising from political pluralism, an institutional feature characterized by a lack of political alignment between national and subnational governments. In the presence of political alignment, domestic firms do not have a comparative advantage over foreign firms. Our evidence thus highlights that even an uncertain and transitory window of opportunity arising from a controversial reduction in competition from the public sector can lead to a fundamental market restructuring in ways that can diverge from the intended policy objective. In particular, domestic firms’ ability to manage political pluralism is a core mechanism explaining their comparative advantage over foreign firms in the wake of a national crisis.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Start-Up Research Grant A-0003843-00-00], the University of Minnesota [Summer Research Grant], and the Indian School of Business [Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06174 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of On-the-Job Experience on Base-Rate Neglect: Evidence from Medical Professionals</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect.This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Lehigh University [FRG Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05461 .</content>

    <title>The Effects of MiFID II on Voluntary Disclosure</title>
    <updated>2025-10-14T13:39:15+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II’s controversial unbundling provision on corporate voluntary disclosure. Although prior research has largely focused on changes in sell-side research post-MiFID II, changes in voluntary disclosure and their effects on the information environment are less known. We find that European Union (EU) firms significantly increased the propensity and frequency of management earnings guidance issuance after MiFID II enactment. This effect is more pronounced among firms experiencing a decline in the quantity of sell-side research or a reduction in the consumption and dissemination of analyst reports and is more muted among firms witnessing improvements in research quality. Furthermore, we find that post-MiFID earnings guidance by EU firms becomes more thorough and elicits stronger market reactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the increased guidance effectively alleviates the negative liquidity effects of MiFID II. Collectively, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the efficacy of MiFID II’s unbundling provision by providing evidence that voluntary disclosure plays a key role in mitigating the unintended net negative consequences on the information environment following the regulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: Financial support from the New York University Stern School of Business, Seoul National University, the Baruch College Zicklin School of Business, and George Washington University is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Can Socially Minded Governance Control the Artificial General Intelligence Beast?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealized conditions that presume that the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI, even if this does not maximize profits. It is demonstrated that a socially minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimize harm from AGI that unrestricted products released by for-profit firms might create. The reason is that a socially minded entity can only minimize the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms at a prohibitive financial cost and so, does not preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine data (MD), that is, data generated by machines, are increasingly gaining importance, potentially surpassing the value of the extensively discussed personal data. We present a theoretical analysis of the MD market, addressing challenges such as data fragmentation, ambiguous property rights, and the public-good nature of MD. We consider machine users producing data and data aggregators providing MD analytics services (e.g., with digital twins for real-time simulation and optimization). By analyzing machine learning algorithms, we identify critical properties for the value of MD analytics, Scale, Scope, and Synergy. We leverage these properties to explore market scenarios, including anonymous and secret contracting, competition among MD producers, and multiple competing aggregators. We identify significant inefficiencies and market failures, highlighting the need for nuanced policy interventions.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00674 .</content>

    <title>Limits of Disclosure Regulation in the Municipal Bond Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effectiveness of recent federal disclosure regulation aiming to improve transparency in the $4 trillion municipal bond market. Governments fail to disclose material private placements 50%–60% of the time and, conditional on disclosure, filings often omit contract details essential for bond pricing. Noncompliant issuers are significantly riskier than compliers, with disclosure decreasing in the potential of privately placed debt to adversely affect bondholders. We show that disclosure reveals positive news and is especially informative to investors in low-rated bonds or during market crises. Overall, privately placed debt continues to pose significant risks to municipal bond investors.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: T.

Some lease the add-on, whereas others sell it through intertemporal price discrimination or bundled pricing. Motivated by these practices, we examine whether a monopolistic firm should lease or sell the add-on when offering both durables. The literature suggests that leasing is preferable for a single durable good as it avoids the time inconsistency problem associated with selling. However, because leasing lacks an intertemporal link, it is less efficient than selling in balancing surplus extraction across consumers, leading to what we call the intraperiod imbalance problem. When the firm sells the base good, this can resolve the time inconsistency of add-on selling but perpetuate the intraperiod imbalance of add-on leasing. Thus, selling the add-on can be more profitable than leasing it. When the firm can choose between selling or leasing the base good, selling both the base good and the add-on can be more profitable than leasing both.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the unique institutional feature that the Israeli government bond market operates on an exchange rather than over-the-counter to analyze whether and why having an exchange affects market liquidity during a crisis. We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets, such as the Israeli government bond market, with markets lacking an exchange. Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02344 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newly released music is never assessed in isolation by audiences, who tend to compare objective (sonic attributes) and subjective (genre affiliations) elements of its identity with the previous musical catalog of the corresponding artist, his or her musically proximal peers, and the most successful releases in the market. In this paper, we provide a general framework that disentangles the objective and subjective identities of new musical releases and evaluates how differentiation affects audience reactions. We posit that radio stations, who seek commercial success, have different preferences toward differentiation in comparison with critics, who grant cultural legitimacy in the industry. Combining play numbers, reviews, and music description data from different sources, we find that radio stations prefer consistency in the musical style of successive releases by the focal artist and especially favor albums that sound similar to chart toppers. Critics, however, exhibit opposite preferences, preferring novelty compared with past works of the artist, while remaining uninfluenced by contemporaneous music dynamics. Our moderation checks reveal that decisions around genre affiliations and scheduling of new releases aid music producers to effectively manage audience expectations. This suggests that data-driven decision support systems can help artists to strategically release new products that cater to heterogeneous tastes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03319 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of promoting whistleblowing on audit quality and the efficiency of detecting misstatements. On the one hand, whistleblowing alerts the enforcer to the possibility of a misstatement and intensifies the regulatory effort, thereby incentivizing the auditor to improve audit quality. On the other hand, promoting whistleblowing reduces the enforcer’s investigative effort when there is no whistleblowing allegation, which in turn dampens the auditor’s incentive to enhance audit quality. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, encouraging more whistleblowing can impair audit quality and reduce detection efficiency. We also examine the socially optimal whistleblowing program, and our analysis implies that the optimal whistleblowing intensity is increasing in investment cost and the quality of the whistleblower’s information.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit within-firm variations in plant-level toxic releases to examine the effect of managerial hometown preference on corporate environmental policies. We find that pollution levels are about 30% lower for plants located near chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) hometowns. This reduction is achieved through resource-intensive pollution control efforts, including source reduction and waste management activities. Analyses using CEO turnover provide causal inferences. Local residents benefit from CEO hometown pollution reduction as localities hosting more hometown plants experience improved environmental conditions and better residential health outcomes. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that CEOs’ hometown preference is related to agency frictions. Overall, our findings reveal the impact of CEOs’ personal motivations on corporate pollution dynamics and their consequential effects on the well-being of local communities.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Q.

    <title>A Preregistered Falsification Test of the Decision by Sampling Model and Rank-Order Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was funded by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation [Grant MAW 2016.0132] and the Swedish Research School of Management and IT.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03611 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel 15-year data set on surgeon adoption of a complex surgical innovation in the English National Health Service and an identification strategy based on surgeon mobility, this paper disentangles three channels of coworker influence on innovation diffusion: (1) peer network size, (2) influential “key players,” and (3) cumulative peer adoption. We find that a one standard deviation in peer connections boost innovation by 16%. Key players can either amplify or dampen diffusion, and peer adoption has a greater impact on less experienced individuals. These results highlight the value of targeting training to high impact network members to speed up diffusion.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the demand for online freelancers using a large data set from a leading global freelancing platform. We identify the types of jobs that are more affected by generative AI and quantify the magnitude of the heterogeneous impact. Our findings indicate a 21% decrease in the number of job posts for automation-prone jobs related to writing and coding compared with jobs requiring manual-intensive skills within eight months after the introduction of ChatGPT. We show that the reduction in the number of job posts increases competition among freelancers, whereas the remaining automation-prone jobs are of greater complexity and offer higher pay. We also find that the introduction of image-generating AI technologies led to a 17% decrease in the number of job posts related to image creation. We use Google Trends to show that the more pronounced decline in the demand for freelancers within automation-prone jobs correlates with their higher public awareness of ChatGPT’s substitutability.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05420 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policies geared toward environmental and economic improvement could unexpectedly lead to negative consequences in other dimensions. Such cases raise a red flag to economists and policymakers who aim to deliver comprehensive and sensible policy evaluations. This article investigates antisocial behaviors in response to the Clean Winter Heating Policy (CWHP), which seeks to improve outdoor air quality. Our results show that participating villagers are more likely to violate laws to burn agricultural waste and exhibit lower prosociality in incentivized dictator games and public goods games. We further explore treatment heterogeneities and find that two channels are likely to play a part. First, the CWHP was perceived as a negative income shock. Therefore, the villagers would want to reduce their expenditure on straw disposal and behave less generously in the incentivized games. Second, the CWHP could trigger discontent and directly affect social preference. Additional evidence suggests that the antisocial (less prosocial) responses could have been avoided by granting larger upfront subsidies.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Gale-Shapley algorithm is one of the most popular college allocation mechanisms around the world. A crucial policy question in its setting is designing admission priorities for students, understanding how they disadvantage certain demographic groups, and whether these differences relate to differences in college performance potential. Studying a policy change in Spain, we find a negative effect of increasing the weight of standardized high-stakes exams on female college admission grades, driven by students expected to be at the top. The impact on admission grades does not affect enrollment, but the percentage of female students in the most selective degrees declines, along with their career prospects. Using data on the college performance of prereform cohorts, we find that female students most likely to lose from the reform tend to do better in college than male students expected to benefit from the reform. The results show that rewarding high-stakes performance in selection processes may come along with gender differences unrelated to the determinants of subsequent performance.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: A.

    <title>Evaluating Mortgage Renegotiation Strategies: A Data-Driven Framework for Investors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper offers a novel framework to quantify the expected gains from renegotiating delinquent loans. The framework accounts for important trade-offs between concessions to borrowers, postdelinquency loan performance, and expected collateral values. The framework’s parameters are calibrated using data on renegotiated 30-year residential fixed-rate mortgages that went delinquent during the Great Recession. Our model-implied expected gains increase during the 2007–2009 period coinciding with an increase in the rate of loan renegotiation. Counterfactual analyses show that larger expected gains can be generated from employing principal forbearance and extensions of the term to maturity compared with principal write-downs and interest-rate reductions. On the other hand, principal write-downs can be a powerful tool when borrowers are deeply underwater. Our analyses illustrate how lenders or policymakers might deploy this framework when faced with another delinquency crisis.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The author thanks the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Investors and Financial Markets at the University of Virginia for funding for this paper.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02672 .</content>

    <title>Do Institutional Investors Stabilize Equity Markets in Crisis Periods? Evidence from COVID-19</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the COVID-19 stock market crash, U.S. stocks with higher institutional ownership (IO) performed worse than those with lower IO. By studying firm-level changes, we identify two mechanisms behind this effect: a sudden downscaling of institutional capital in the equity market and a collective attempt by institutions to reposition their equity portfolios toward more COVID-resilient stocks. The stock price effects of their “portfolio downscaling” trades quickly reversed in the market’s recovery phase, whereas those of their “portfolio repositioning” trades lingered. The institutional rush for firm resilience also caused price pressures, with retail investors providing liquidity to stocks sold by institutional investors, both during the crisis and afterward. Overall, our results indicate that when a tail risk is realized, institutional investors amplify price crashes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S. Glossner and P.

    <title>Combining Ad Targeting Techniques: Evidence from a Field Experiment in the Auto Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retargeted advertising that tries to entice potential customers back to a website is widely used by advertisers and has often replaced more traditional forms of targeting, such as contextual targeting that tries to match ads to website content. However, existing research has not investigated the extent to which these different targeting techniques compete with or complement each other. To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale field experiment with an automobile manufacturer to investigate how retargeting meshes with more traditional techniques of contextual targeting online and in turn how that should affect ad content. We investigate this using three different measures of online advertising effectiveness: website visits, engagement, and soft conversions. We find that combining contextual targeting and retargeting is more effective for all three measures. However, to unleash this effectiveness, marketers have to pay attention to the ad content in their retargeted ads. We find that when combining retargeted advertising with contextual targeting, ads that prompt users to customize an offering are the most effective. Last, we provide empirical evidence for understanding the underlying mechanism associated with our findings and replicate those findings with a laboratory experiment.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02310 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective management of a firm’s operating cash flow is essential for supporting growth, servicing debt, and maintaining overall financial health. Mismanagement of cash flows can result in severe liquidity challenges and even business failure. However, managing operating cash flow is complex because of its intricate, endogenous relationships with operational variables, like sales, operating costs, inventory, payables, and the impact of exogenous macroeconomic factors on a firm. In this paper, we present a structural model of operating cash flow that untangles this endogeneity, allows us to estimate causal relationships among these variables, and provides a valuable tool for evaluating cash flow management policies. Applying our model to quarterly financial data from S&amp;P’s Compustat database spanning from 1990 to 2020 along with macroeconomic indicators, we provide empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of cash flow with other operational variables. We then showcase the practical value of our model by (i) identifying the characteristics of structural shocks and the new equilibria they induce within the system; (ii) offering a tool for evaluating alternative managerial actions or policy decisions to counteract these shocks; (iii) predicting the impacts of macroeconomic events, such as global recessions and fluctuations in economic sentiment, on firm performance; and (iv) demonstrating superior forecasting performance compared with traditional univariate models. In summary, our structural model of operating cash flow enhances our understanding of its dynamics, enabling better-informed decision making and more effective cash flow management in firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03790 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the problem of sharing the revenues raised from subscriptions to music streaming platforms among content providers. We provide direct, axiomatic, and game-theoretical foundations for two focal (and somewhat polar) methods widely used in practice: pro rata and user centric. The former rewards artists proportionally to their number of total streams. With the latter, each user’s subscription fee is proportionally divided among the artists streamed by that user. We also provide foundations for two families of methods addressing the rising concern in the music industry to explore new streaming models that better align the interests of artists, fans, and streaming services. One of the families offers a natural compromise between the pro rata and user-centric methods. The other family generalizes the user-centric method while capturing various formalizations of incentives for artists and users.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Xunta de Galicia [Grant ED431B2022/03] and MCIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and FSE+ [Grants PID2020-113440GBI00, PID2020-115011GB-I00, and PID2023-146364NB-I00].</content>

    <title>Revealed Wisdom of the Crowd: Bids Predict Loan Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the popularity of the phrase “wisdom of the crowd,” not all crowds are wise because not everyone in them acts in an informed, rational manner. Identifying informative actions, therefore, can help to isolate the truly wise part of a crowd. Motivated by this idea, we evaluate the informational value of investors’ bids using data from online, debt-based crowdfunding, in which we were able to track both investment decisions and ultimate repayment statuses for individual loans. We propose several easily scalable variables derived from the heterogeneity of investors’ bids in terms of size and timing. We first show that loans funded with larger bids relative to the typical bid amount in the market or to the bidder’s historical baseline, particularly early in the bidding period, are less likely to default. More importantly, we perform theory-driven feature engineering and find that these variables improve the predictive performance of state-of-the-art models that have been proposed in this context. Even during the fundraising process, these variables improve predictions of both funding likelihood and loan quality. We discuss the implications of these variables, including loan pricing in secondary markets, crowd wisdom in different market mechanisms, and financial inclusion. Crowdfunding platforms can easily implement these variables to improve market efficiency without compromising investor privacy.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Business Analytics Center in the Scheller College of Business and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02575 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is more competition the key to mitigating dominance by large tech platforms? Could regulation of such markets be a better alternative? We study the effects of competition and interoperability regulation in platform markets. To do so, we propose an approach of competition in net fees, which is well-suited to situations in which users pay additional charges, after joining, for on-platform interactions. Compared with existing approaches, the net fee model expands the tractable scope to allow variable total demand, platform asymmetry, and merger analysis. Regarding competition, we find that adding more platforms to the market may lead to the emergence of a dominant firm. In contrast, we find that interoperability can play a key role in reducing market dominance and lowering prices. Broadly speaking, our results favor policy interventions that assure the formidability of the competition that dominant platforms face.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that losses constrain short sellers but not the transmission of information to prices. Using unique data on U.S. equity lending, we document a negative impact of the mark-to-market losses of a stock’s short sellers, but no impact of their gains, on the future shorting of the stock. Consistent with funding and institutional constraints limiting short selling, we further show that the effect is highly asymmetric across different loss levels and stronger among stocks facing higher margin requirements. However, loss-making short selling has no impact on price efficiency or predictive power for returns, suggesting that these constraints affect mostly uninformed shorting activity.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the University of Melbourne [Faculty Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01356 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a measure of local long-run growth prospects, I uncover a novel link between economic fundamentals and house prices. Whereas excess housing returns are positively associated with economic growth prospects, housing valuations are negatively associated with shocks to growth prospects. I document an explanation in metro-area consumption: housing consumption is asymmetrically exposed to economic prospects in that it expands more quickly when prospects are strong than it contracts when prospects are poor. I explain these findings through the lens of an asset pricing model that focuses on a trade-off between nonseparable committed housing and nonhousing consumption.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: Data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01996 .</content>

    <title>Sampling-Based Approximation for Series Inventory Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study inventory management of an infinite-horizon, series system with multiple stages. Each stage orders from its immediate upstream stage, and the most upstream stage orders from an external supplier. Random demand with unknown distribution occurs at the most downstream stage. Each stage incurs inventory holding cost while the most downstream stage also incurs demand backlogging cost when it experiences inventory shortage. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over the planning horizon. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to obtain a heuristic policy (SAA policy) using the empirical distribution function constructed from a demand sample (of the underlying demand distribution). We derive an upper bound of sample size (viz., distribution-free bound) that guarantees that the performance of the SAA policy be close (i.e., with arbitrarily small relative error) to the optimal policy under known demand distribution with high probability. This result is obtained by first deriving a separable and tight cost upper bound of the whole system that depends on (given) echelon base-stock levels and then showing that the cost difference between the SAA and optimal policies can be measured by the distance between the empirical and the underlying demand distribution functions. We also provide a lower bound of sample size that matches the upper bound (in the order of relative error). Furthermore, when the demand distribution is continuous and has an increasing failure rate (IFR), we derive a tighter sample size upper bound (viz., distribution-dependent bound). Both distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the newsvendor problem, a special case of our series system, improve the previous results. In addition, we show that both bounds increase polynomially as the number of stages increases. The performance of SAA policy and the sample size bounds are illustrated numerically. Finally, we extend the results to finite-horizon series systems.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: K.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the first adaptively priced iterative combinatorial auction design, which gradually extends price expressiveness as the rounds progress. This mechanism achieves both high efficiency and fast convergence across a wide range of valuation domains. We implement our auction design using polynomial prices, show how to detect when the current price structure is insufficient to clear the market, and show how to correctly expand the polynomial structure to guarantee progress. An experimental evaluation confirms that our auction is competitive with bundle-price auctions in domains where these excel, namely multiminded valuations, but also performs well in domains favorable to linear prices, such as valuations with pairwise synergy.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4993 .</content>

    <title>Economics of Social Media Fake Accounts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid the rise of the influencer economy, fake social media accounts have become prevalent on many social media platforms. Yet the problem of fake accounts is still poorly understood, and so is the effectiveness of coping strategies. This research models the ecosystem of fake accounts in an influencer economy and obtains insights on fake account purchasing behaviors, the impact of antifake efforts, and the roles of various contextual factors. We show that as the antifake effort increases, the equilibrium may transition from a “pooling” equilibrium, where a low-quality influencer buys fake accounts to mimic a high-quality one, to a “costly separating” equilibrium, where a high-quality influencer may buy fake accounts to prevent mimicry from a low-quality influencer, and to a “naturally separating” equilibrium where low- and high-quality influencers are separated without buying fake accounts. We find that increasing antifake efforts and increasing social media literacy may sometimes result in more fake accounts. A purely profit-driven platform always prefers a pooling equilibrium with zero antifake effort. As a platform puts more weight on consumer welfare, it may exert a positive effort to induce a separating equilibrium, but the platform’s preferred antifake effort tends to be lower than that of consumers. We also find that the platform sometimes prefers a lower social media literacy and a lower fake account base price, whereas consumers prefer the opposite. In contrast, improving the antifake technology level can benefit both the platform and consumers. Our main insights are applicable to scenarios with more influencer types and repeated interactions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Retention or Acquisition? Behavior-Based Quality Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms frequently extend their brand by introducing products in new categories and offering free samples or demonstrations for customers to learn about the quality of the new products before purchasing. When introducing new products based on customers’ purchase behavior in the former category, firms face two customer segments: their own customers and the competitor’s customers. Firms can practice behavior-based pricing (BBP) by charging different prices in the two segments. Moreover, firms can practice behavior-based quality disclosure (BBD) by disclosing quality information to the two customer segments differently. In this paper, we examine how firms practice BBD in addition to BBP. We find that in contrast to the acquisition-focused BBP, firms perform retention-focused BBD by increasing quality disclosure to their own customers and decreasing it to the competitor’s customers. Unlike BBP, which decreases second-period profit and increases first-period profit, BBD increases second-period profit but decreases first-period profit when the disclosure cost is low. We also show that when firms endogenously choose BBD, the equilibrium is a prisoner’s dilemma when the disclosure cost is low and a win-win outcome when the disclosure cost is high.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72171103] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01081 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One may reasonably think that cultural homophily, defined as the tendency to associate with others of similar culture, affects collaboration in multinational teams in general but not in superstar teams of professionals at the top of their industry. The analysis of an exhaustive data set on the passes made by professional European football players in the top five men’s leagues reveals that on the contrary, cultural homophily is persistent, pervasive, and consequential, even in superstar multinational teams of very-high-skill individuals with clear common objectives and aligned incentives who are involved in interactive tasks that are well defined and not particularly culture intensive.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: G.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demand externalities arise when past sales stimulate future demand. They pervade many consumer markets. To penetrate such markets, how should manufacturers contract with retailers? We formulate the problem as a dynamic game, wherein the retailer can privately observe and control evolving market conditions, and consumers can act either myopically or strategically. Our contribution is threefold. (i) We characterize the optimal contract: It resolves a dynamic tradeoff between exploiting demand externalities, screening new information, and optimizing channel efficiency; moreover, it has a simple implementation of quantity discount. (ii) We characterize the dual role of demand externalities. Although demand externalities can improve channel surplus by expanding market size, they can also exacerbate information friction by enhancing the retailer’s ability to manipulate the market. Ignoring the dark side of the agency cost, previous studies may have overestimated the benefit of demand externalities. (iii) We provide new practical guidance. We show private information per se need not hurt channel efficiency: The manufacturer can use recursive advance selling to extract new information for free. Our results also shed light on when and why manufacturers should moderate demand externalities and prefer long-term contracts. By highlighting the dual role of demand externalities in long-run channel performance, this study sharpens our understanding of channel theory and practice.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: L.

    <title>To Ask or Not to Ask: The Effects of Broadly and Narrowly Adopted Peer-Recognition Systems on Help Seeking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many companies now use peer-recognition systems that allow employees to publicly recognize their peers for positive behaviors. Practitioners have touted the potential for these systems to increase helping among employees. However, the extent to which employees actually use these systems to recognize their peers varies across organizations; some are used broadly by many employees across all functional, specialty, geographic, and hierarchical subgroups of the organization, whereas others are only narrowly used by some, but not all, subgroups. Across three experiments, we examine how peer-recognition systems impact employees’ propensity to ask others for help (i.e., help seeking) based on whether the system is broadly used by all subgroups or only narrowly used by specific subgroups. We predict and find that a peer-recognition system broadly used by all subgroups strengthens employees’ perception of a help-seeking norm. This perception increases employees’ propensity to seek help directly through norm conformity and indirectly by reducing the perceived psychological costs of help seeking. We also predict and find that the effect of peer-recognition systems that are narrowly used by specific subgroups is moderated by whether employees belong to the subgroups using the system; whereas it increases help-seeking propensity for members of the subgroups using the system, it decreases help-seeking propensity for nonmembers relative to when there is no peer-recognition system. Our theory and results suggest that peer-recognition systems can increase help seeking, but these same systems could decrease help seeking for employees belonging to subgroups that do not use the system.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Supported by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00318 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a measure of the speed of firm-level information diffusion, study how it is affected by limited attention, and examine its effect on real corporate decisions. Using local flu epidemics as exogenous attention shocks, we show that inattention from dual-covering analysts and cross-holding institutions reduces the speed of information diffusion from customer to supplier stock prices. We find that the speed of information diffusion along the supply chain affects the price feedback effect for corporate investment decisions and facilitates coordination between customers and suppliers. Our findings demonstrate that coattention from key market participants affects information efficiency and generates real economic outcomes.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: L.

    <title>Designing Information to Engage Customers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collaborative customization is common in many markets. Sellers and customers can collectively discover the value of the product’s basic design. Customers’ willingness to pay can also be increased by being engaged to improve the product design. We study how a seller can design the information structure of collective learning about the product’s basic value to induce costly customer engagement. We consider a setting in which the parties’ expected payoffs are determined endogenously through the strategic interaction between seller pricing and customer engagement and purchase. The customer tends to be engaged in equilibrium, as the uncertainty on the product’s basic value becomes higher to dilute the responsiveness of the optimal price to customer engagement. Therefore, the seller seeks to maximize the probability of generating an intermediate posterior belief. Thus, the optimal information design involves either exaggerating or downplaying the product’s basic value when the prior is low or high, respectively. We show that considering restrictive information structures can generate qualitatively different implications. We also examine how the unobservability of engagement may influence the parties’ strategic interaction, their expected payoffs, and the seller-optimal information design. Interestingly, unobservability may lead to lower equilibrium engagement, hurt the seller, render the customer’s equilibrium expected payoff to increase as customer engagement becomes less important or more costly, and yield more or less information provision.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploitation of consumer data allows online retailers to enhance services provided to consumers but at the risk of causing unintended privacy issues. There has been debate about whether to devise regulation policies to restrict data collection and usage by online retailers. This paper studies the implications of newly adopted privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for an online retail supply chain comprising a retailer and a supplier. We find that despite the GDPR’s intention to safeguard consumer privacy, it may inadvertently hurt consumer surplus while benefiting the retailer. In fact, the GDPR may lead to an outcome detrimental to all parties involved, including the retailer, supplier, and consumers, thereby resulting in a triple-lose situation. Our results hold significant implications for consumers, supply chain firms, and policymakers alike, contributing to the existing literature on evaluating the impact of privacy regulations on technology innovation and adoption.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01819 .</content>

    <title>Secondary Market Monetization and Willingness to Share Personal Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People are often unaware that their personal data can serve as valuable inputs for economic activities in secondary data markets. However, whether secondary monetization of personal data determines privacy preferences remains unclear. I examine whether privacy decisions are motivated by the data recipient’s ability to benefit from trading individuals’ data with a third party. A large online laboratory experiment involving personally identifiable psychometric data is implemented with real data-sharing consequences and monetary benefits. I find that individuals decrease their willingness to share data—both in terms of their likelihood of participating in the data market and the prices demanded for such participation—when the recipient’s ability to monetize the data through secondary trade is salient. Strategic responses to updated beliefs about the recipient’s gain from the trade are ruled out via the chosen price elicitation. I find that increased data exposure (to more recipients) does not explain the significant revealed disutility from secondary monetization. These findings are also robust to controlling for the risk exposure differences between data recipients and third parties.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This project was funded in part by the Institute for the Social Sciences, Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03423 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How competition affects manipulation by firms of information about important attributes of their products and how such information manipulation impacts firms’ short-term and long-term performance are open empirical questions. We use a setting that is especially suitable for answering these questions—centralized crypto exchanges, on which information manipulation takes the form of inflated trading volume. We find that static and dynamic competition measures are positively associated with volume inflation, indicating that competition may lead to increased information manipulation. Exchanges that manipulate volume obtain short-run benefits but are punished in the long run, consistent with the trade-off between short-lived increases in rents and future losses because of damaged reputation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 2225/21], the Coller School of Management Blockchain Research Institute, the Henry Crown Institute for Business Research in Israel, and the Cornell Fintech Initiative for financial support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02903 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teams are formed because input from different people is needed. Providing incentives to team members, however, can be difficult. According to received wisdom, declaring all members responsible fails because real responsibility for team output “diffuses.” But why? Also, why and when does formally declaring one member “responsible” mean that this member can be attributed real responsibility? We offer a model that answers these questions. We identify when jointly declaring a team responsible results in reputation free riding. We show that declaring one person responsible can overcome this problem but only if all other team members are protected from being sanctioned.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>Stressed Banks? Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study short-term and medium-term changes in bank risk-taking as a result of supervision and the associated real effects. For identification, we exploit the European Central Bank’s asset-quality-review (AQR) in conjunction with security and credit registers. After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit supply, with the greatest effect on riskiest securities. We find negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit availability. Moreover, nonbanks with higher exposure to reviewed banks acquire the shed risk. After the AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities but not riskier credit, resulting in negative medium-term firm-level real effects. These effects are especially strong for firms with high ex ante credit risk. Among these nonsafe firms, even those with high ex ante productivity, experience negative real effects. Our findings suggest that banks’ liquid assets help them to mask risk from supervisors and risk adjustments banks make in response to supervision have persistent corporate real effects.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: J.-L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relationship between a firm’s successful protest of a government agency’s conduct or terms of a procurement contract and the amount of business the firm conducts with the government going forward. We find firms receive fewer and less valuable government contracts, face more contract cancellations, and experience significant reductions in sales growth and employee growth. Despite widespread belief, successful bid protesters do not delay government procurement because of lengthy dispute resolutions. Overall, we provide the first analysis of corporate interactions with the United States government bid protest system.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02055 .</content>

    <title>Selling Data to Marketers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The supply and the demand for data analytics are growing rapidly. Recent years have seen a surge in the availability of massive consumer data and in the emergence of data sellers (e.g., brokers and intermediaries). Unlike standard products, the value of data analytics for marketers depends on how their business decisions can be enabled and improved. In this paper, we investigate how a monopoly seller can offer a menu of data-based service plans to screen heterogenous marketers that can decide whether to take an action (e.g., direct selling, targeting, lending) with uncertain value and privately known cost. We characterize how, and for which marketers, the provision of information may be distorted in the optimal design. We present conditions under which optimally supplied information can be socially excessive or insufficient. It is shown that selling data appends may yield double reversals in the optimal service plans, in comparison with those when the seller’s offerings serve as marketing lists (i.e., the action is infeasible under the marketers’ outside option). We articulate how these results are coherently driven by the same underlying mechanism regarding how the marginal value of information is endogenously derived from the improvement in the marketers’ decision making over their default action. We also examine how our results can be enriched in alternative settings on the production and the costs of information.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <title>The Value of Specific Knowledge: Evidence from Disruptions to the Patient–Physician Relationship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a member of a work team leaves, some knowledge is lost to the organization. Exploiting quasi-random turnover among military physicians because of deployments, I estimate the effects of turnover on patients and other providers in the same care team. I find that a discontinuity in primary care leads to a 3%–5% increase in costs driven primarily by an increase in the use and intensity of specialty care with no observable benefit to the patient as measured by potential reductions in hospitalization rates and emergency department usage. This indicates that the full cost of turnover includes a reduction in access to knowledge among remaining members of the team.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03884 .</content>

    <title>Long Lags and Large Returns: Experimental Evidence from Advertising to Businesses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a multiyear experiment, we show that advertising to businesses can generate very different responses than has been observed for consumers. First, we estimate larger advertising returns than typically found for consumers: a return on ad spend of 12.0 (95% CI: 4.8–24.5). Second, we estimate longer lags between ad delivery and purchase: 1–5 months for first-time purchases and 5–12 months or longer for repeat purchases. Third, we find that existing business customers are responsible for most of the revenue lift from advertising, though this appears to be driven by existing business customers purchasing new parts. Additionally, our results demonstrate that geography-based switchback experiments that randomize the time between treatments can provide an effective means of estimating lagged effects. For this study we randomized the delivery of digital display ads for electronic components offered by a semiconductor manufacturer; nearly all electronic products require such components.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: M.

    <title>Market Ambiguity Attitude Restores the Risk-Return Trade-Off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A positive relation between the conditional mean and conditional volatility of aggregate stock returns, although viewed as a fundamental law of finance, has been challenging to find empirically. We consider a representative agent asset pricing model with Knightian uncertainty and demonstrate that this risk-return trade-off depends on the agent’s ambiguity attitude (reflecting the agent’s degree of optimism or pessimism). The model predicts that the conditional equity premium is increasing in market volatility, but its slope flattens as market optimism rises. We develop a methodology to extract the representative agent’s ambiguity attitude from our asset pricing model. Results validate our model predictions. We document the significant in-sample and out-of-sample explanatory power of ambiguity attitude in explaining the risk-return trade-off. In our sample, market volatility is not significant in forecasting returns. However, including the market ambiguity attitude leads to a significant positive relationship between volatility and future returns. Hence, our model and results identify market ambiguity attitude as a missing state variable that can explain why the literature has found it difficult to empirically validate the risk-return trade-off.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03595 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 4,000 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests across 600 U.S. counties from 2014 to 2021, we examine how BLM activism shapes corporate diversity at different organizational levels. We develop an approach integrating OpenAI's GPT‐4 with Chain‐of‐Thought prompting to classify race and ethnicity. In our validation tests, this method achieves higher accuracy than several tested open‐source algorithms. Our main findings are as follows. First, although firms headquartered in protest‐affected counties add more Black directors, particularly in larger protests, this gain appears to largely offset the representation of other non‐Black minority directors. Second, these board‐level shifts do not consistently extend to executives or the general workforce. In contrast, a gap may emerge between a firm's workforce composition and local labor‐market demographics, particularly in the representation of Black employees. This pattern is consistent with diversity tokenism, which suggests firms may prioritize high‐visibility board appointments and potentially downplay broader, transformative change. Our findings indicate that although board‐level diversity gains are highly visible and attract notable public attention, they may not be accompanied by an organization's transformative commitment to company‐wide diversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct the first large-scale study of how different stakeholder groups assess corporate culture and quantify the economic implications of those differences. We employ generative AI to analyze analyst reports, call transcripts, and employee reviews, and organize the extracted information into a knowledge graph that links a culture type to its perceived causes and effects. We demonstrate that the divergence in different stakeholder groups’ assessment of culture aligns with their distinct roles and economic incentives. Moreover, we show that analysts’ culture analyses are incorporated into stock recommendations and target prices, and investors react to divergence in stakeholders’ assessment of culture.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are allowed to use aggregate data on market salaries to set pay, a practice known as salary benchmarking. Using national payroll data, we study firms that gain access to a tool that reveals market benchmarks for each job title. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the benchmark information reduces salary dispersion by 25\\%. Thus, salary dispersion must stem partly from aggregate uncertainty about the salaries offered by other firms. Our model formalizes how salary dispersion can arise even in competitive labor markets for identical workers when such uncertainty exists, and we discuss implications for an ongoing policy debate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess the relationship between the racial diversity of medical providers and racial health disparities in the use of preventive care and in patient outcomes. We use unique data from the Military Health System, where we observe providers as patients so that we can identify their race, and where moves across bases change exposure to provider race in a plausibly exogenous fashion. We consider patients with four chronic, deadly, but manageable illnesses, where the relationship with the provider may have the most direct impact on health. We find striking evidence that provider racial diversity leads to reduced disparities in maintenance of preventive care and mortality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper cuPDLP.jl: A GPU Implementation of Restarted Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient for Linear Programming in Julia, by Haihao Lu and Jinwen Yang, addresses a fundamental question in large-scale optimization: Can modern GPUs be effectively leveraged for linear programming? The authors introduce cuPDLP.jl, a GPU-based solver implementing a restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method entirely in Julia. Through extensive benchmarking on standard LP test sets, including MIPLIB relaxations and Mittelmann’s benchmarks, the study demonstrates that cuPDLP.jl achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art commercial solvers such as Gurobi. Notably, the GPU implementation exhibits significant speedups on large-scale instances, highlighting the potential of first-order methods and GPU architectures for scalable optimization. The results mark a notable step toward high-performance LP solvers designed for modern hardware.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Price Caps on Advertising to Physicians: Evidence from the 340b Drug Pricing Program</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of price caps on the provision of costly effort by pharmaceutical firms using variation in drug discounts generated by a price regulation program that allows eligible hospitals to purchase outpatient drugs at steep discounts. These discounts directly affect drug manufacturers’ markups and may change firms’ incentives to exert promotional effort targeted toward physicians at these hospitals. We find that the effects of price regulation on pharmaceutical firm effort depend crucially on the design of the regulations and the multiproduct nature of pharmaceutical firms. Using detailed data on marketing payments from pharmaceutical firms to physicians, we observe that physicians receive 13% fewer promotional payments after their hospitals take up the program. The design of the price caps implies that discounts tend to increase with a drug’s age. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that pharmaceutical firms shift promotional payments away from older drugs and toward newer drugs, which are less affected by the price caps. For some drugs, this shift results in an increase in payments to physicians despite the price caps. Understanding these strategic, nonprice adjustments is important for policymakers seeking to design effective regulations targeting specific products.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by The Morrison Center for Marketing and Data Analytics and the National Science Foundation [Grant SES-1919040].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05073 .</content>

    <title>Engaging Customers with AI in Online Chats: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how artificial intelligence (AI) affected the productivity of customer service agents and customer sentiment in online interactions. Collaborating with a meal delivery company, we conducted a randomized field experiment that exploited exogenous variation in giving agents access to AI-generated suggestions. We found that AI improved both the efficiency and effectiveness of the interactions: AI-assisted agents responded faster, engaged customers more deeply, and achieved greater improvements in customer sentiment. The benefits were most pronounced for less-experienced agents. However, AI’s impact varied by conversation type: It improved efficiency and customer sentiment in subscription cancellation requests but was the least effective in repeat complaint scenarios because of systemic issues beyond the AI’s capability. A text analysis of agent messages suggests that improved customer sentiment was explained by AI-assisted agents exhibiting higher levels of key response characteristics: empathy, information, and solution. Furthermore, we exploit a unique data feature: Customers first chatted with an automated chatbot without any human intervention before they were transferred to human agents (who may or may not have had AI assistance). We found that if customers who had experienced chatbot comprehension failures were then connected to AI-assisted human agents, the involvement of AI negatively affected customer sentiment. This is because unusually rapid responses in the latter scenario led customers to believe they were still communicating with a chatbot only, suggesting a spillover from their initial negative chatbot experiences. Companies should understand the conversation contexts, such as customer intent and chatbot interactions, when integrating AI into their customer support strategies.This paper has been accepted by Catherine Tucker for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This research was supported by funding provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03920 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mandatory disclosure is a primary source of public information available to acquirers, yet little is known about how potential target managers respond to takeover threats by avoiding mandatory disclosure. This study focuses on redactions in material contracts as a setting of mandatory disclosure avoidance. We find that managers facing takeover threats are more likely to redact material contracts than other managers. To better differentiate the motives for redactions, we classify redacted contracts into nine different categories and examine managers’ redaction decisions on the three most prominently redacted types. We find managers facing takeover threats redact research and development contracts more heavily when firms possess trade secrecy, as a strategy to thwart technological acquisitions aiming at innovation combinations. By contrast, managers redact purchase and sales contracts and license and royalty contracts more heavily when they have greater private control benefits. Overall, our results highlight new tactics that managers use when they face takeover threats, especially under threats of technological acquisitions.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: L.

    <title>Cyberbullying Victimization, Mental Distress, and Adolescent Substance Use: The Role of Cyber Features</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research Spotlight: Cyberbullying, Mental Health, and Substance Use in AdolescentsCyberbullying victimization elevates adolescent substance use by intensifying mental distress. Analyzing over 500,000 survey responses, interviews, and experiments, we find that cyber features critically moderate this pathway: publicity (being observed/joined by an audience) aggravates distress, whereas separation (temporal/spatial distance) mitigates it. For policymakers, these findings underscore the need for legislation that mandates platform accountability and supports school-based mental health initiatives. Technology designers should deploy AI-driven systems to detect and deamplify harmful content while implementing built-in tools that enhance user control—such as delayed message delivery and reduced visibility features—to foster separation. Schools and parents must promote digital literacy, teach healthy coping strategies (e.g., sports, social support), and provide accessible counseling. A multistakeholder approach is essential to reduce the mental health burden of cyberbullying and prevent subsequent substance use.</content>

    <title>Why Is the Grass Always Greener on the Other Side? Tourist Bias in Online Restaurant Ratings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important assumption underlying online ratings’ helpfulness is that rating valence can serve as a good proxy for the quality of a product or service. However, consumers with different backgrounds may have different quality perceptions of the same product or service. As one of the most common types of reviews, restaurant reviews can come from two very different groups of customers: locals and tourists. Merely showing the average rating of a restaurant by pooling all ratings may not be helpful for consumers who wish to determine whether a given restaurant is a good match for them. We find that traveler consumers are much more likely than local consumers to provide higher restaurant ratings, and they tend to attach more pictures, write shorter reviews, and use fewer cognitive words. Individuals’ changes in focus and changes in evaluation processes induce such a tourist bias in ratings. Meanwhile, travel destination, restaurant cuisine authenticity, and consumers’ consumption pattern changes are not responsible for the bias. Our study demonstrates the necessity of differentiating travelers’ and locals’ ratings/reviews and identifies possible reasons behind the tourist bias, which can help retailers, consumers, and platforms better understand, utilize, and manage digital word-of-mouth in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the Tutoring Online Program (TOP), where tutoring is entirely online and tutors are volunteer university students matched with underprivileged middle school students. We leverage random assignment to estimate effects during and after the pandemic (2020 and 2022), investigating channels of impact. Three hours of individual tutoring per week increased math performance by 0.22 SD in 2020 and 0.20 SD in 2022. Higher dosage yielded stronger effects, while group tutoring smaller effects. TOP enhanced students’ aspirations, socioemotional skills, and psychological well-being, but only during school closures. We also estimate the impact of TOP on tutors, finding an increase in empathy.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a monetary quasi–experiment in Sweden from 2010–2011, when the Riksbank raised the interest rate substantially. We argue that this increase was beyond what labor market conditions warranted, driven instead by new concerns about financial stability. Using a battery of specifications that rule out domestic or international confounders, we show that this monetary tightening led to a substantial economic contraction, raising unemployment by 1–2 percentage points. Using administrative microdata, we find that sectors with nominal wage rigidity drove much of the response and that the monetary contraction was more regressive than the typical business cycle.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adverse selection benefits firms able to identify talent. An informed intermediary expropriates agents’ ability by threatening to fire and expose them to undervaluation of their skill. An agent’s track record gradually reduces intermediary’s information advantage. In response, the intermediary starts churning well-performing agents she knows are less skilled. The accelerated reduction in information advantage boosts profits, as retained agents accept below-reservation wages to build reputation faster. Agents prefer starting their careers working for an intermediary, as benefits from building reputation faster more than offset expropriation costs. Our analysis applies to professions where talent is essential and performance is publicly observable. (JEL D21, D82, J23, J24, J31, J63, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a linear GMM estimator of the discrete-time mixed proportional hazard (MPH) model of duration with an arbitrary distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. We allow for competing risks, observable characteristics, and censoring. We prove our estimator is consistent and apply it to the duration of price spells. We find substantial unobserved heterogeneity with economically meaningful implications for the response of output to a monetary policy shock in a model with time-dependent pricing rules and for the degree of state dependence in a model of price plans.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Did credit drive the 2000s housing cycle? The existing literature’s findings range from credit having no effect to credit explaining most of the cycle. We show that these disparate results hinge on the extent to which landlords absorb credit-driven demand, which depends on the degree of housing market segmentation. We develop a model that nests cases between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically considered, estimate an elasticity that pins down the degree of segmentation, and use it to calibrate our model. We find credit standards played an important role, explaining 32 percent to 53 percent of the boom. (JEL E32, E44, G51, R21, R31)</content>

Expressions characterizing the optimal tax schedule in each community are provided that capture the fiscal externalities associated with migration and the effects of redistribution between households and landlords. Correlation between skill and locational preferences yields optimal transfers to poor areas, while sorting based on comparative advantage can motivate transfers in either direction. A calibration to areas targeted by the US Empowerment Zone program yields sizable optimal spatial transfers that are sensitive to assumed levels of migration responsiveness.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;International migrants may facilitate the transmission of ideas across countries. We examine the impact of migrant exposure to reproductive health policies on origin-country fertility in the Philippines. We exploit temporal variation in destination-country reproductive health policies combined with spatial variation across Philippine provinces in their migration intensity and historical composition of migrant destinations. Migrant exposure to more liberalized reproductive health policies reduces origin-community fertility. This reduction is driven by increased adoption of modern contraceptives. Visible policy changes, such as commercial advertising of contraceptives, lead to this change in behavior. Firmly established family planning values moderate the fertility response.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy-relevant treatment effect estimation in a marketplace setting requires assessing both the direct treatment benefit and spillovers induced by changes to the market equilibrium. We show how to identify and estimate policy-relevant treatment effects using a unit-randomized trial run within a single large market. A Bernoulli-randomized trial allows consistent estimation of direct effects and of treatment-heterogeneity measures that enable welfare-improving targeting. Estimating spillovers—and providing confidence intervals for the direct effect—requires estimates of price elasticities, which we provide using an augmented experimental design. We illustrate our results using a simulation calibrated to a conditional cash-transfer experiment in the Philippines. (JEL C21, C51, I32, I38, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Software is one of the most important assets that needs to be priced in the digital economy. It has emerged as a disruptive technology, with companies primarily valued for their software offerings growing from 2 percent to 13 percent of market share between 1996 and 2023. We document persistent anomalies in growth forecasts and stock returns for software companies, indicating significant deviations from rational expectations over multiple decades. Our findings are consistent with Bayesian investors gradually learning about software’s growing importance, highlighting how markets can be very slow to discern fundamental shifts from transient shocks in noisy data.

We first show that business owners are considerably more likely to employ copartisan workers. This phenomenon is in part driven by the overlapping of political and social networks. Multiple tests—surveys, event studies, analyses of wage premia and promotions within the firm, and a field experiment—further highlight how business owners’ political preferences directly influence firms’ employment decisions. A channel of political discrimination appears more relevant than one of political quid pro quo between firms and politicians. (JEL C93, D22, D72, J23, M51, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how passive investing affects asset prices. Flows into passive funds disproportionately raise the stock prices of the economy’s largest firms, especially those large firms in high demand by noise traders. Because of this effect, the aggregate market can rise even when flows are entirely due to investors switching from active to passive funds. Intuitively, passive flows increase the idiosyncratic risk of large firms in high demand, which discourages investors from correcting the flows’ effects on prices. Consistent with our theory, prices and idiosyncratic volatilities of the largest S&amp;P500 firms rise the most following flows into that index. (JEL G12, G23, E44)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U sing lenders who become members of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as an exogenous shock, we examine whether and how lenders’ commitment to transparent climate-related disclosures affects borrowers’ environmental performance. We find that borrowers of TCFD-member lenders, relative to control firms, significantly improve their environmental performance after the TCFD launch. Lenders’ disclosure commitments influence borrowers through credit rationing and monitoring. Specifically, polluting borrowers face higher borrowing costs, reduced access to credit, and greater incorporation of environmental action covenants in loan agreements. Additionally, polluting borrowers of TCFD-member lenders experience heightened financial constraints. Finally, borrowers of TCFD-member lenders are more likely to adopt the TCFD framework for climate-related disclosure after the TCFD establishment. Together, these findings illuminate the role of lenders in driving corporate environmental performance improvement through their commitment to transparent climate-related disclosures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct the first annual market rent and home sales price series for American cities over the 20th century using 2.7 million newspaper real estate listings. Our findings revise several stylized facts about U.S. housing markets. Real market rents did not fall during the postwar period in most cities and rose nationally by 60% from 1890 to 2006. We also document higher sales price growth between 1953 and 1987 relative to previous series. Real prices reached almost 4 times their 1890 level by 2006. Prices grew most in metros with high demand and low levels of construction. We find that the rent-to-price ratio fell from about 8% in the early 20th century to 3% by 2006, consistent with declines in the cost of owning housing relative to renting. For the typical year in our period, the annual return to owning housing was 9%, driven mostly by rental returns of 7.7%, with capital gains contributing only 1.3%. While capital gains were close to zero from 1890 to 1940, they grew to nearly a third of total returns from 1970 to 2006.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Boosting Profits of Trade-in Programs Through Smarter PricingAs electronics trade-in programs expand worldwide, firms face complex pricing challenges: quoting offers instantly while managing vast product varieties and uncertain demand. In the article “Dynamic pricing for a multiproduct consumer electronics trade-in program” in Operations Research, the authors address this challenge and present effective solutions. The study develops pricing policies that determine both trade-in offers and resale prices over time to maximize profits. It first introduces a static pricing approach and proves that it performs nearly optimally; then, it further proposes a dynamic “batched-adjustment” policy that adapts to demand uncertainty and delivers an improved profit performance. Numerical experiments confirm the advantages of these methods. By demonstrating simple yet powerful strategies with provable effectiveness, the research offers firms actionable tools to increase profitability in trade-in operations.</content>

    <title>Correlation Improves Group Testing: Modeling Concentration-Dependent Test Errors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Population-wide screening is a powerful tool for controlling infectious diseases. Group testing can enable such screening despite limited resources. Viral concentration of pooled samples are often positively correlated, either because prevalence and sample collection are influenced by location, or through intentional enhancement via pooling samples according to risk or household. Such correlation is known to improve efficiency when test sensitivity is fixed. However, in reality, a test’s sensitivity depends on the concentration of the analyte (e.g., viral RNA), as in the so-called dilution effect, where sensitivity decreases for larger pools. We show that concentration-dependent test error alters correlation’s effect under the most widely used group testing procedure, the two-stage Dorfman procedure. We prove that when test sensitivity increases with concentration: pooling correlated samples together (correlated pooling) achieves asymptotically higher sensitivity than independently pooling the samples (naive pooling). In contrast, in the concentration-independent case, correlation does not affect sensitivity. Moreover, with concentration-dependent errors, correlation can degrade test efficiency compared with naive pooling, whereas under concentration-independent errors, correlation always improves efficiency. We propose an alternative measure of test resource usage, the number of positives found per test consumed, which we argue is better aligned with infection control, and show that correlated pooling outperforms naive pooling on this measure. In simulation, we show that the effect of correlation under realistic concentration-dependent test error is meaningfully different from correlation’s effect assuming fixed sensitivity. Our findings underscore the importance for policy makers of using models that incorporate naturally occurring correlation and of considering ways of strengthening this correlation.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Provost’s Office of Cornell University, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [Grant FA9550-19-1-0283], and the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences [Grant DMS2230023].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04217 .</content>

    <title>No Gifts Returned: Surprise Bonuses Reduce Productivity in a Natural Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gift exchange hypothesis posits that workers reciprocate above-market wages with increased productivity. This paper tests this hypothesis in a natural field experiment where one or both workers in a pair received a discretionary bonus after an initial round of data entry tasks. Bonuses were assigned based on one of three criteria: (i) relative productivity in the initial round, (ii) economic need, or (iii) an arbitrary decision. Two conditions where neither or both workers received a bonus served as the baseline. Contrary to the gift exchange hypothesis, we found a significant decline in postbonus productivity, especially when both workers received the bonus. This result suggests that workers interpreted the bonus as a signal of employer contentment, allowing them to reduce their effort. We conjectured that the postbonus productivity decline may result from either (a) a lower perceived risk of repercussions from slacking, such as early dismissal, or (b) a reduced sense of obligation to reciprocate the employer’s kindness. A follow-up experiment replicated the primary result, providing moderate evidence for the explanation based on reduced fear of dismissal. The main effect of bonuses on productivity was substantial, with effort reductions of 15.1% in the first experiment and 8.4% in the follow-up relative to baseline. In cases where only one worker received a bonus, nonrecipients’ inequality aversion appeared to decrease productivity markedly in the economic need treatment, whereas status-seeking behavior slightly increased productivity by bonus recipients in the productivity treatment.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a parsimonious set of factors from a large pool of candidates for explaining hedge fund returns, ranging from equity market, anomaly, and trend-following factors to macroeconomic factors. The resulting 9-factor model, including five anomaly factors, outperforms existing hedge fund models both in sample and out of sample, with a significant reduction in alphas while showing substantial cross sectional performance heterogeneity. Further analysis based on fund holdings confirms the model’s ability to capture returns from arbitrage trading. Overall, the anomaly factors help quantify hedge fund strategies and risk exposures and improve fund performance evaluation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the factor structure in delta-hedged equity option returns. A sparse latent factor model generates a correlation of 0.90 or higher between average and predicted option returns. A comparable performance is achieved with a characteristic-based model containing four factors: the equally weighted option portfolio, a factor based on the difference between historical and implied volatilities, a factor based on the ratio of corporate cash holdings to the total value of the firm’s assets, and a factor based on volatility of volatility. Traditional stock return factors cannot explain these option factors.</content>

    <title>Non‐Market Strategy and Deglobalization: Firm–State Relations and the Historical Microfoundations of Corporate Political Activity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines deglobalization through the lens of non‐market strategy (NMS), focusing on the antecedents and microfoundations of corporate political activity (CPA) in the global aluminium industry. Drawing on archival research and historical analysis, we challenge the prevailing view of deglobalization as a state‐driven reversal of globalization. Instead, we reconceptualize it as a co‐evolving process of firm–state relations, where multinational enterprises (MNEs) and governments jointly construct institutional arrangements. Our analysis demonstrates how MNEs leverage ideological alignments, elite networks, and long‐term political capabilities to influence protectionist policies, trade governance, and national development agendas. We identify the microfoundations of CPA – ideological affinity, embedded agency, and networked trust – as critical to shaping institutional and policy outcomes with macroeconomic and geopolitical consequences. By tracing firm–state interactions across a century of global change, we demonstrate how CPA functions as a historically constituted practice through which firms exercise both ideological and political agency. In reframing deglobalization as not merely an external constraint but a strategic outcome co‐produced by business and state actors, this study extends non‐market strategy theory. We highlight how deglobalization and globalization are not sequential opposites but intertwined processes, co‐constructed through the persistent deployment of NMS and CPA.</content>

    <title>Design-Mediated Morality: The Transformative Potential of Aesthetic Objects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Art and artisanal objects carry the potential for moral transformations. Although consumer research suggests a relationship between aesthetic taste and morality, scholars have not deeply considered the role of material design in shaping consumers’ moral self. We address this missing link by theorizing the formative process of design-mediated morality: defined as the transmission of moral values into design objects through manifestos and design scripts, which allow consumers to experience morality in direct material engagements. We draw on a longitudinal ethnography of the New Nordic Food movement and its iconic flagship restaurant, noma, to demonstrate the influence of manifestos in streamlining moral virtues with aesthetic expressions. We identify three distinct scripting strategies (simulation, estrangement and sensitization) that steer consumers’ sensory and affective engagement with design objects. Our findings also explain that consumers’ moral awakening is tied to direct material engagement (or 'thinging’) with said objects. By highlighting the embodied dimensions of moralization, our work connects and advances research streams on market-mediated moralization, taste formation and experiential marketing. We conclude with critical reflections on the role of artisanal movements and design in affecting moral transformations, as well as outline avenues for future research on design-mediated morality in everyday consumption contexts.</content>

    <title>Don't calm down! How affective climate emerges in start‐ups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Different types of affective climates—norms related to the experience, expression, use, and regulation of emotions—have been shown to impact organizational outcomes. However, we know less about how these climates emerge. This study investigates the emergence of affective climates through a 22‐month longitudinal multiple‐case study of five early‐stage start‐ups. Our analysis revealed that an affective climate of high authenticity emerged in start‐ups through three key mechanisms: the interaction between positive and negative emotions, constructive meta‐emotions, and interpersonal emotion regulation characterized by emotional validation and problem‐solving. Our findings contribute to the understanding of affective climate emergence and offer nuanced insights into how founders, managers, and teams can cultivate constructive emotional dynamics in highly uncertain, fast‐paced environments.Managerial SummaryWe explore how affective climate emerges through a longitudinal case study of five start‐ups. Affective climate describes norms and assumptions concerning the experience, expression, use, and regulation of emotions. Research suggests that an affective climate of high authenticity—meaning that members feel free to express their actual emotions—contributes to creativity and performance while reducing burnout. However, prior research offers few insights into how and why different affective climates emerge in start‐ups. We find that managers and founders may shape their organization's affective climate toward high authenticity by fostering positive emotions, through an accepting attitude toward their own negative emotions, and by validating employees' emotions. By doing so, managers and founders can foster healthy emotional dynamics in their start‐ups.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the increased use of data technologies, like machine learning, by financial intermediaries affect the allocation of capital towards innovation? I study this question in the context of startup financing by venture capitalists (VCs). While VCs adopting data technologies become better at screening startups similar to those in historical data, they tilt their investments towards this pool and become concurrently less likely to finance innovative startups that achieve rare major success. Plausibly exogenous variations in VCs’ screening automation suggest that these effects are causal. These findings highlight how investors’ adoption of data technologies can have real effects through innovation financing. (JEL G24, L26, O30)</content>

    <title>Teams in Crisis: The Effect of Team Familiarity on Performance Under Conditions of Crisis and Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on fluid teams has consistently found a positive relationship between team familiarity and performance, but little empirical research has investigated whether these benefits of familiarity extend to times of crisis and uncertainty. This study examines how team familiarity influences provider decision times in the emergency department, focusing on how its effects vary across different crisis and uncertainty contexts. Using patient and provider assignment data from a large, multisite emergency department, we construct care team familiarity networks and analyze familiarity’s impact on decision-making speed during both low-uncertainty crises (high-acuity patient surges) and high-uncertainty crises (early COVID-19 pandemic), as well as under conditions of patient-level task uncertainty. We find that team familiarity consistently reduces provider decision times; familiarity is particularly beneficial during crises. However, across both crisis and noncrisis situations, we find that the positive effects of familiarity are significantly weakened under conditions of high uncertainty. These findings underscore the conditional nature of familiarity’s benefits, suggesting that in highly uncertain or novel situations, teams cannot rely solely on past shared experience to maintain performance. Implications for staffing strategies in healthcare and other high-stakes environments highlight the need for organizations to balance the benefits of familiarity with adaptability in the face of uncertainty.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2025.20912 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present an experimental study of investors’ willingness to pay for socially responsible assets. In our initial public offering experiment, various assets share identical financial risk-return profiles but differ in the intensity and timing of societal benefits, represented by charitable donations. We find that subjects value societal benefits positively and prefer a positive correlation between financial returns and these societal benefits. We offer implications for the design of corporate social responsibility policies and for the pricing of responsible assets.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Chair on Sustainable Finance at Toulouse School of Economics.

    <title>Motivator or Depletor? Unraveling the Double‐Edged Effects of Peer Monitoring on Employee Job Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer monitoring, as a type of organizational control, is increasingly important in managing employee performance. However, extant research primarily focuses on the benefits of peer monitoring on job performance, while largely ignoring its potential negative consequences. We advance the literature to theorize and test the double‐edged effects of peer monitoring on job performance by examining its self‐regulatory consequences. Specifically, we propose that peer monitoring can simultaneously increase both work engagement and ego depletion, which in turn exert positive and negative impacts on job performance, respectively. Furthermore, we theorize that trait self‐control is a critical contingent factor that moderates both the positive and negative pathways from peer monitoring to job performance. We test our model through a two‐wave, multisource field survey study involving 203 employees and their 49 direct supervisors in China, as well as through an experimental study with 149 full‐time working employees in the United States. We find consistent evidence for the negative consequences of peer monitoring on job performance via ego depletion, while the positive pathway through work engagement is only supported by the field survey study. Furthermore, both studies show that there is a positive indirect effect of peer monitoring on job performance via work engagement when employees have lower trait self‐control and a negative indirect effect via ego depletion when employees have higher trait self‐control. Such examination helps elucidate the positive and negative effects of peer monitoring on job performance and has important theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances the understanding of innovation across generations in family businesses by revealing how imprinting and self-determination shape innovation trajectories following succession. Through a case study of 16 Dutch family Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry, we identified four innovation trajectories—Inherited, Ancillary, Synergistic, and Detached Innovation. We disentangle the effect of structural imprinting and behavioral imprinting on the successor and examine how successor self-determination mediates imprinting forces. We rebalance the emphasis on incumbent-centric family business studies and explain the heterogeneity of post-succession innovation outcomes. These insights offer new theoretical tools for understanding and managing innovation during critical transition periods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some research has suggested that investors prefer pitches made by men rather than women entrepreneurs, and physically attractive men entrepreneurs are even more successful than their physically unattractive counterparts. However, empirical evidence remains limited. We re-examine these findings using a large archival dataset with 9,285 entrepreneurs across 13 industries and 105 countries between the years of 2014 to 2018. Our results replicate the female penalty effect—women raised 12.9% less funds compared to men. However, we found that the physical attractiveness of the entrepreneurs has a negative main effect on startups’ success, and that this effect is only significant for men entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While increasing evidence supports the workplace benefits of green human resource management (HRM) practices, this research explores how and when employees' experiences with these practices influence their green behaviors at home. Drawing on the work‐home resource model, this study examines the dual mechanisms of green job demands and resources while also exploring the moderating role of proactive vitality management. Study 1, a four‐wave time‐lagged survey, revealed that experienced green HRM practices were associated with both green job demands and green job resources. On the one hand, green job demands led to increased green job fatigue, which in turn reduced green behaviors at home. On the other hand, green job resources fostered green self‐efficacy, which subsequently enhanced green behaviors at home. Importantly, the negative indirect relationship between green HRM practices and green behaviors at home via green job demands and green job fatigue was stronger when employees' proactive vitality management was low, whereas the positive indirect relationship via green job resources and green self‐efficacy was stronger when proactive vitality management was high. Study 2, a four‐wave cross‐lagged survey, replicated the findings of Study 1 and further clarified the causal direction of these relationships. This research contributes to the literature on green HRM practices by uncovering their cross‐domain implications and highlighting both their benefits and costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can organizations establish collaboration between their established members and a newly hired member? We address this question by studying firms undergoing scaling using a multiple‐case study. We find that widely involving the new hire into the established managers' activities backfires. Such extensive involvement is intended to build the same kind of strong, personal relationships with the new hire that the established managers share amongst themselves and, in doing so, establish collaboration. But the established managers' relationships turn out to beirreplicable. Being extensively involved without possessing the same kind of relationships, the new hire becomes perceived as anintruder. In contrast, involving the new hire more selectively led to the new hire becoming respected as a relationally distant but professionally appreciated “stranger,” which engendered effective collaboration.Managerial SummaryCollaboration between a company's newly hired and established managers is necessary for it to scale but difficult to establish. Many firms mistakenly attempt to involve a new hire in the established managers' activities as much as possible, hoping to build strong personal bonds quickly. We show that this strategy often backfires. The kind of relationships that the established managers have is not easy to replicate, and widely involving the new hire in the absence of such relationships can spur the established managers to perceive the new hire as an intruder. Instead, limiting the new hire's involvement to only the activities directly linked to his or her job may result in the new hire becoming respected as a professional “stranger.” Doing so avoids the discomfort of forced closeness and facilitates effective collaboration.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Value of Blending - Managing Ameliorating Inventory Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stocks of some food products, such as whiskey, cheese, or port wine, ameliorate during storage, facilitating product differentiation according to age. This induces a trade-off between immediate revenues and further maturation. Inventory management decisions include purchasing volumes of agricultural produce and production volumes for age-differentiated products. Because products can be blended from stocks of different ages, issuance decisions offer operational flexibility. However, whereas some industries (port wine, sherry) only request that the product labels refer to the average age of issued stocks, others (whiskey, rum) have stricter blending regulations, requiring that the product labels represent the minimum age of all components. Further, producers must deal with multiple uncertainties. Purchase prices of agricultural commodities depend on volatile climate-dependent harvest seasons, stocks decay during maturation, and sales market conditions fluctuate. We solve this inventory management problem using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with three key innovations: (i) a novel actor pipeline that decomposes the action space and flexibly partitions decision dimensions between a neural network and a lookahead optimization model, (ii) an algorithm explicitly maximizing average rewards, and (iii) reward-handling techniques that exploit structural problem insights. Our approach yields near-optimal policies that consistently outperform benchmark heuristics. Beyond the algorithmic contributions, our results offer new managerial insights into the value of blending under uncertainty. Minimum-age blending substantially enhances the profits of firms as compared to no blending because companies can adjust their purchasing policy in response to price fluctuations. The more flexible average-age regime further improves profits by 8.7% on average, suggesting that whiskey and rum regulators may wish to reconsider their strict blending rules. We mine black-box policies from deep reinforcement learning using supervised machine learning and Shapley values to analyze near-optimal decision drivers. Exploiting the value of blending requires producers to install sufficient processing capacity, especially when dealing with large variations in harvest seasons. Additionally, blending entails increased planning complexity because the inventory management decisions are driven by a large number of factors.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Unveiling the Human Touch: Enhancing Customer Satisfaction through Personal Profiles of Social Media Customer Service Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are rapidly adopting social media platforms to optimize their customer service operations. Given the central role of social media as a primary point of contact with customers and the critical importance of maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction, it is imperative to craft positive experiences during service interactions. To enhance customer interaction with a personal touch, U.S. telecom giant T-Mobile replaced standardized profiles with personal profiles for its social media customer service agents on Twitter. Leveraging this exogenous change, we investigate how these personal profiles affect customer behaviors within service operations. We adopt a Difference-in-Differences empirical strategy in this research. The results show that implementing personal profiles for customer service agents increases positive sentiment in customer tweets, reduces the likelihood of complaints, and improves overall satisfaction. Further analyses suggest that the effects vary across customer groups, with greater impact among verified Twitter users and female customers. While personalized agent profiles can enhance satisfaction, they also heighten expectations for timely responses, making delays more detrimental than with standardized profiles. To explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an online randomized experiment. In addition to reinforcing the causal inference from our secondary data analysis, causal mediation analysis of the experimental data shows that personal agent profiles influence satisfaction and the likelihood of customers expressing gratitude through the perceived warmth and perceived competence of the agents. Interestingly, while the effect on gratitude is mediated by humanization, we do not find a similar mediation effect on satisfaction. This suggests distinct pathways through which humanization shapes different aspects of the customer experience.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Conformity or Differentiation? How Consumers Respond to the (In)consistency between Product Ratings and Review Sentiments in the US and China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates the joint impact of numeric ratings and review sentiments in prior product reviews on consumers’ product evaluations and how this impact varies between individualist and collectivist cultures. Using data on 115,231 consumer reviews of 167 American movies released both in the US and China, the authors find that the joint impact of movie ratings and review sentiments varies with the consistency between the two information sources, as well as their valence. Furthermore, their analysis reveals that the joint impact differs between the two cultures. The authors suggest that these findings may arise because consumers’ perception of information credibility varies depending on the information consistency and their cultural background. The findings offer important implications for firms in managing UGC platforms for consumers’ product reviews and social media across global markets.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Beyond Cookies: Evidence about Team Coproduction and Engagement Retention from Girl Scouts Cookie Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retention is a critical challenge for organizations, especially nonprofits, which often face higher turnover than for-profit firms. Unlike many for-profits, nonprofits have fewer financial resources to retain participants, so continued participation depends more on team climate and opportunities to learn by working together. We study these dynamics in the Girl Scouts Cookie Program. We collect sales and troop membership information between 2016 and 2018 from a local Girl Scout council consisting of approximately 30,000 members. We examine the effects of a group of three team diversity features: disparity, variety, and separation, on a Girl Scout’s decision to return to sell cookies the following year. Our results suggest that a more evenly distributed sales performance within the troop (i.e., low sales disparity) is associated with higher retention, with larger gains for lower sellers. In addition, greater grade level (i.e., age) variety is associated with higher retention for both younger and older participants. Furthermore, mixing newcomers with returnees (i.e., high return-status separation) has asymmetric dual effects: high return-status separation tends to discourage new girls from returning while encouraging returning girls to stay. Finally, we find that returning participants tend to sell more in subsequent years, consistent with learning-by-doing. These empirical results have implications for the GSUSA and other similar NPOs to compose teams and organize collaboration activities to improve engagement and enhance learning.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: No News about Climate Action Is Good News for Low-Polluting Firms</title>
    <updated>2025-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception of firms, significantly impacting their operations and performance. Firms often attempt to influence media channels to showcase their climate action initiatives, aiming to enhance their public image, reputation, and stakeholder trust. While firms cannot directly control their media coverage, intentional or unintentional dissemination of their climate action efforts can thrust them into the media spotlight. The implications of this media spotlight remain uncertain. While firms may anticipate positive public relations benefits from such exposure, it may also raise environmental expectations for the firm and risk highlighting less favorable aspects of their environmental practices. Despite previous research on the impact of media exposure on firms’ financial outcomes, a notable gap exists in understanding how the media spotlight on firms’ climate actions affects their operational and financial performance. A clear hurdle is the lack of a systematic and objective measurement of such a spotlight. Our study addresses this research gap by developing a machine learning-based framework to derive a climate action vocabulary as a novel information artifact. The vocabulary is subsequently used to measure the intensity of media attention on a firm’s climate actions. Our research reveals that an increased media spotlight on climate actions, regardless of their sentiment, has an adverse effect on firms’ financial performance, primarily due to the rise in operational costs. Furthermore, we find that the impact of media spotlight is heterogeneous. Low-polluting firms experience negative financial consequences as the downside of the heightened media spotlight. In contrast, high-polluting firms and those operating in polluting industries may witness an overall positive financial impact. We also find that firms’ market orientation (B2B vs. B2C), durability classification, index constituency (i.e., S&amp;P 500), and greenwashing status significantly moderate the relationship. Our research highlights key considerations for corporate leaders with respect to the drawbacks for low-polluting firms in seeking media attention for their climate actions. Given that the media captures society’s limited attention, our research suggests that firms should refrain from promoting superficial narratives about climate change that distract society from more impactful sustainability conversations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing School Seat Allocation to Improve Access and FairnessA growing shortage of public school seats in Chile has left thousands of students unassigned each year. In their forthcoming Operations Research paper, “Capacity Planning in Stable Matching,” Bobbio et al. (2025) develop a novel framework that jointly determines where to expand school capacities and computes a student-optimal stable assignment in the enlarged market. The study develops exact and heuristic methods that make this theoretically complex problem tractable in practice. Using rich administrative data from the Chilean school choice system, the framework demonstrates how adding a limited number of seats can trigger improvement chains benefiting multiple students, also revealing diminishing marginal returns to capacity expansion. Beyond the Chilean context, the framework provides a versatile toolkit that can be adapted to other constrained allocation problems, offering a rigorous foundation for data-driven policy design in education and beyond.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving the Discriminant Validation of Multi-Item Scales</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discriminant validation examines to what extent constructs measured with multi-item scales, which are hypothesized to be conceptually distinct, are empirically distinct. A literature review of published scale development studies shows that a variety of criteria and approaches to assess discriminant validity are in use. However, the requirements for an appropriate criterion have not been spelled out, which has led to the use of problematic criteria. The present research introduces three requirements that an appropriate discriminant validation criterion should satisfy, concerning the correlation, comparison standard, and comparison method. It shows that the common Fornell and Larcker criterion is based on an inappropriate comparison standard and method and that alternative criteria have weaknesses as well. The authors therefore propose an improved comparison standard, congeneric reliability (CR), and develop a systematic discriminant validation procedure based on CR and an existing criterion (Phi), both of which satisfy the three requirements. The procedure provides continuous measures of support for discriminant validity and accounts for measurement and sampling error. A detailed case study and reanalyses of seven published scale development articles demonstrate the application and strengths of the procedure. Example code and an online application facilitate its implementation.</content>

    <title>The Double-Edged Roles of Generative AI in the Creative Process: Experiments on Design Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI (GenAI) promises to revolutionize creative work, but its value is not universal. Using controlled lab settings with students and real-world tests with professional designers, our research shows that GenAI is a double-edged tool. In the initial brainstorming (ideation) stage, GenAI reliably boosts creativity for all users. However, in the execution (implementation) stage, whereas novice designers continue to benefit from GenAI’s assistance, expert designers encounter inefficiencies—spending significantly more time without improving creativity, because GenAI’s methods conflict with experts’ well-established routines. For firms, this means adoption strategies must be nuanced. GenAI delivers the greatest value when applied to brainstorming, early concept development, and work by less-experienced employees. In contrast, deploying GenAI in later-stage production tasks, especially with seasoned professionals, may reduce efficiency. Managers and tool designers should avoid blanket promotion of GenAI across all tasks and instead develop targeted adoption strategies that align with employees’ expertise and the stage of the creative process. By tailoring GenAI use, organizations can harness its creative potential while minimizing risks of counterproductive outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing awareness and use of family‐friendly work activities (FFWAs), also known as work‐life benefits, highlights their importance for both employees and organizations. Despite the importance of these activities for both employees and organizations, the existing literature is fragmented, lacking a clear consensus on their conceptualization and measurement. In this review, we content analyze conceptual and methodological aspects of the FFWA literature. Specifically, applying the systems perspective from the strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature, we introduce and conceptualize family‐friendly work systems (FFWS), define their key domains, specify the FFWAs within them, and clarify their hierarchical structure (i.e., policies, practices, and processes). Building on the FFWS model, we evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity in current research. By identifying inconsistencies as well as strengths and weaknesses in the existing literature, this review provides a timely contribution that can guide future research and offer practical recommendations for policymakers and organizations striving to create more family‐friendly workplaces.</content>

    <title>Bridging Moral Aspirations and the Mundane Reality: A Grounded Study of the Process of Radical Purpose Adaptation in a Business School</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In previous research, scholars have often highlighted the important role of leaders in defending and protecting a historical organizational purpose. However, adopting such a ‘backward‐looking’ perspective, researchers have devoted much less attention to understanding how an organizational purpose can be deliberately changed and leveraged to justify novel moral commitments, thereby bridging the moral and the mundane. We theorize these activities as a process of radical purpose adaptation, whereby an established organization deliberately and radically changes its purpose to align with its commitment to society. We draw on a single, longitudinal case study of a business school as it engaged in the process of changing its organizational purpose. Adopting a social‐symbolic work lens, we conceptualize purpose as a social‐symbolic object and theorize purpose work, which captures leaders’ efforts to establish new organizational aspirations. We find that proactive purpose work leads to the unintended emergence of self‐reinforcing, competing demands that threaten the new purpose, which are tackled through reactive purpose work. Thus, a recursive process emerges in which proactive and reactive purpose work operate in tandem: proactive work generates novel aspirations and tensions, while reactive work contains and redirects them, enabling organizations to stabilize new commitments without abandoning their transformative intent.</content>

    <title>Concentration in cross‐border research collaborations and &lt;scp&gt;MNCs&lt;/scp&gt;' knowledge creation in a host country</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study elucidates the previously underexplored structural heterogeneity inherent in multinational corporations' (MNCs) internal linkages by examining the concentration of cross‐border collaborations among inventors within host countries. Building on the boundary spanning literature, we develop a two‐stage framework identifying the knowledge distortion mechanism arising from this concentration: information overload in the cross‐country knowledge absorption stage and long transmission paths and knowledge hoarding in the within‐country diffusion stage. Both hinder local knowledge creation. We further propose that cross‐country and within‐country network structures serve as contingencies moderating this relationship. The negative effects of collaboration concentration are exacerbated by structural holes in cross‐country networks but attenuated by the reach and density of within‐country networks. Empirical results based on American pharmaceutical MNCs from 1980 to 2008 support our hypotheses.Managerial SummaryEffectively structuring internal cross‐border R&amp;D collaborations is crucial for MNCs seeking to enhance local innovation outcomes. Although many firms focus on increasing cross‐border linkages, this study highlights that overlooking how collaborations are distributed among inventors can obscure key drivers of innovation performance. This research shows that given the number of cross‐border linkages, their concentration in the hands of a few inventors within a host country hinders local knowledge creation. The negative effect is amplified when the host country spans many structural holes in the cross‐country network. A well‐structured within‐country network with high reach or high density can help mitigate the effect by facilitating knowledge diffusion. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the structural and geographic configuration of internal MNC networks in global R&amp;D strategy.</content>

    <title>An Analysis of Laparoscopic and Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgeries: Surgeon Experience, Learning, and Task Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study examines the transfer of learning in the context of different surgical methods used to complete surgical procedures. Surgeons' total experience is characterized by the procedure (i.e., focal or different) and the surgical technology or method used (i.e., laparoscopic‐assisted minimally invasive surgery [LAS] or robot‐assisted minimally invasive surgery [RAS]). Using data from a large US university hospital with specialized surgical departments, and drawing on task‐technology fit and fit appropriation model theories, we propose three novel hypotheses that focus on different facets of how learning transfers across methods and tasks for individuals. The findings contribute to research on individual learning by distinguishing between method learning (how the task is performed) and task learning (the knowledge of the task itself). We find the following key findings. First, the experience from the RAS (LAS) method has a significant (no) effect in reducing LAS (RAS) duration for the same procedure. Second, learning from other procedures is contingent on the method used to complete the task. Specifically, the experience from other procedures completed using the LAS (RAS) method increases (decreases) the LAS (RAS) duration. Overall, the results indicate that the transfer of learning from RAS to LAS is greater than from LAS to RAS. This suggests that learning transfer across technologies is asymmetrical and requires careful consideration regarding how accumulated surgical experience from various technologies impacts task performance. From a task‐technology fit and fit appropriation model theory perspective, our study highlights the importance of technologies' capabilities in knowledge transfer across methods.</content>

    <title>Internal venturing as a signal: How entrepreneurial employees gain career benefits in organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do employees benefit from acting entrepreneurially in a corporate environment? Drawing on signaling theory, we propose that entrepreneurial behaviors lead to tangible career benefits through the creation of new internal ventures, which serve as a credible signal of an employee's leadership potential. Using a time‐lagged design with a sample of 643 employees, we found in Study 1 that employees engaging in higher levels of entrepreneurial behaviors are more likely to create new internal ventures, which subsequently lead to more promotions and—in larger organizations—higher compensation. Study 2 employed a within‐subjects design to directly evaluate the signaling value of new internal venture creation. Together, our findings highlight internal venturing as a key mechanism through which entrepreneurial employees can gain career benefits within established organizations.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurial employees are often seen as organizational misfits. Yet, our research shows that acting entrepreneurially in a corporate environment can enhance employees' career success through new internal venture creation. In two studies, we find that employees engaging in higher levels of entrepreneurial behaviors—asking questions to challenge the status quo, observing with fresh perspectives, exchanging ideas across diverse networks, and experimenting with new approaches—are more likely to launch new internal corporate ventures. The act of new internal venture creation, in turn, leads to more promotions and—in larger organizations—higher compensation, because it sends a positive signal of an employee's leadership potential. Our findings offer practical insights for both entrepreneurial employees and organizations seeking to foster entrepreneurial spirit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We educate investors about the benefits of dividend reinvestment and costs of misperceiving dividends as free income. The intervention increases planned dividend reinvestment in survey responses. Using trading records, we observe a causal increase in dividend reinvestment in the field of roughly 50 cents for every euro received. This holds relative to investors’ prior behavior and various control samples. Investors who learned the most from the intervention update their trading the most. The results suggest the free dividends fallacy is a significant source of dividend demand. Our study demonstrates that simple, targeted, and focused educational interventions can affect investment behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of introducing junior unsecured loans (i.e., FinTech loans) into the small business lending market. Using French administrative data, we find that firms experience a 13% increase in bank credit after receiving a FinTech loan. We use propensity score matching procedures and a shift-share instrument to account for credit demand. The credit increase only occurs when FinTech borrowers invest in new assets, and Fintech borrowers are subsequently more likely to pledge collateral to banks. This suggests that firms use FinTech loans to acquire assets that they then pledge to banks, thereby increasing total borrowing capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit information in patent applications to construct an instrumental variable for the identification of technology news shocks that relaxes all the identifying assumptions traditionally used in the literature. The instrument recovers news shocks that have no effect on aggregate productivity in the short-run, but are a significant driver of its trend component. The shock prompts a broad-based expansion in anticipation of the future increase in total factor productivity (TFP), with output, consumption, and investment all rising well before any material increase in TFP is recorded. Despite the positive conditional comovements, the shock only accounts for a modest share of fluctuations of macroeconomic aggregates at business cycle frequencies. Financial markets price-in news shocks on impact, while most of the macro aggregates respond with some delay.</content>

    <title>The Origins and Control of Forest Fires in the Tropics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Environmental externalities – uncompensated damages imposed on others – lie at the root of climate change, pollution, deforestation and biodiversity loss. Empirical evidence is limited, however, as to how externalities drive private decision making. We study one such behavior, illegal tropical forest fires, using 15 years of daily satellite data covering over 107,000 fires across Indonesia. Weather-induced variation in fire spread risk and variation in who owns surrounding land allow us to identify how far externalities influence the decision to use fire. Relative to when all spread risks are internalized, we find that firms overuse fire when surrounded by unleased government lands where property rights are weak. In contrast, and consistent with the Coase Theorem, firms treat risks to nearby private concessions similarly to risks to their own land. Government sanctions, concentrated on fires spreading to populated areas, also deter fires, consistent with Pigouvian deterrence.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Consequences of Exchange Rate Depreciations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the consequences of “regime-induced” exchange rate depreciations by comparing outcomes for peggers versus floaters to the U.S. dollar in response to a dollar depreciation. Pegger currencies depreciate relative to floater currencies and these depreciations are strongly expansionary. The boom is associated with a fall in net exports, and (if anything) an increase in interest rates in the pegger countries. This suggests that expenditure switching and domestic monetary policy are not the main drivers of the boom. We show that a large class of existing models cannot match our estimated responses and develop a model with imperfect financial openness that can. Following a depreciation, uncovered interest parity deviations lower the costs of borrowing from abroad and stimulate the economy, as in the data. The model is consistent with (unconditional) exchange rate disconnect and the Mussa fact, even though exchange rates have large effects on the economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a California field experiment, I investigated the impact of a Facebook outreach campaign aimed at increasing enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The campaign used a promising marketing strategy known as “retargeting,” where ads were delivered to a randomly selected subset of over 16,000 eligible nonparticipants who had nearly completed the SNAP application process, while a control group remained unaffected. Despite leveraging ad content developed in collaboration with nonprofit and government partners, the campaign did not produce statistically or economically significant increases in enrollment, even when considering the extreme values of estimated confidence intervals.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by Code for America and the National Institute on Aging [Grant T32-AG000186].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06312 .</content>

    <title>Unlocking Privacy in Healthcare: The Impact of Explanations on Privacy Concerns and Self‐Disclosure to Conversational Technologies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While artificial intelligence (AI)‐based conversational technologies offer exciting prospects in healthcare, the lack of transparency and elevated privacy concerns in using such technologies remain a challenge and make much‐needed information difficult to obtain while administering patient care. Approaches that emphasize transparency and interpretability of AI systems provide a promising avenue to address these concerns. In this study, we explore the role of transparency‐enhancing explanations as a way for caregivers to elicit truthful disclosure of otherwise private information from patients. Specifically, we explore how automated explanations provisioned by conversational technologies can help reduce the user's privacy concerns and bring about self‐disclosure, thus helping to improve key outcomes such as accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Through an online experiment with 556 participants in a healthcare context, we uncover the mediating effects of two critical factors, informational justice and perceived relevance, on privacy concerns. We find that explanations foster perceptions of informational justice and perceived relevance in the user, which help reduce privacy concerns and bring about self‐disclosure. The study's findings have implications for researchers as well as practitioners who leverage conversational technologies in healthcare and other service contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the concept ofsubtle discrimination—biased acts that cannot be objectively ascertained as discriminatory. When candidates compete for promotions by investing in skills, firms' subtle biases induce discriminated candidates to overinvest when promotions are low‐stakes (to distinguish themselves from favored candidates) but underinvest in high‐stakes settings (anticipating low promotion probabilities). This asymmetry implies that subtle discrimination raises profits in low‐productivity firms but lowers them in high‐productivity firms. Although subtle biases are small, they generate large gaps in skills and promotion outcomes. We derive further predictions in contexts such as equity analysis, lending, fund flows, banking careers, and entrepreneurial finance.</content>

    <title>Going for Broke: Bank Reputation and the Performance of Opaque Securities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can banks’ reputational concerns improve the quality of opaque, off‐balance sheet securities, such as mortgage‐backed securities? We study this question in a uniquely parsimonious setting. In the 1760s, Dutch banking partnerships securitized West‐Indian plantation mortgages that were risky and opaque. High‐reputation banks originated better mortgages and issued securities that, on average, retained 17.5% more of their value during a market collapse. Reputational effects are attenuated when the managing partners were married into wealth or received a large share of profits in the short term, suggesting that bank reputation only works if bankers are personally exposed to (long‐run) reputational losses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using confidential supervisory risk ratings, we document that banks increase risk after going public compared to a control group of banks that filed to go public but withdrew their filings for plausibly exogenous reasons. The increase in risk improves short‐term performance at the expense of long‐term performance. We argue that the increase in risk stems from pressure to maximize short‐term stock prices and earnings once the bank is publicly traded. After going public, banks owned by investors that place greater value on short‐term performance increase risk more, and those managed by CEOs with more short‐term compensation also increase risk more.</content>

    <title>Unveiling the Strategic Impacts of Extending Membership-Based Free Shipping Programs Beyond the Online Marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online marketplaces are increasingly extending their membership-based free shipping (MFS) programs to include external sellers, transforming logistics capabilities into a “logistics-as-a-service” (LaaS) model. This study uses a game-theoretic approach to analyze the implications of such extensions, with Amazon as a leading example. Contrary to the widespread belief that LaaS is a stand-alone profit center, our findings reveal that the primary value of extended MFS lies in enhancing the marketplace’s core business. By attracting member consumers and optimizing fulfillment operations, marketplaces can increase commission revenues and reduce per-order logistics costs—even if LaaS itself operates at a loss. Importantly, this strategy can benefit the broader marketplace ecosystem, including both internal and external sellers and member consumers, while potentially disadvantaging nonmembers. For practitioners and policymakers, these results underscore the need to rethink competitive dynamics and pricing strategies in digital platforms. Rather than viewing extended MFS solely as a logistics monetization tool, it should be seen as a strategic lever for shaping marketplace structure, seller participation, and consumer behavior.</content>

    <title>Anti‐labor environments and employee entrepreneurship: Evidence from right‐to‐work laws</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how changes in labor unions and related labor environments affect employees' likelihood of starting a new business. We suggest that the enactment of stringent anti‐union laws reduces incentives for employees to stay with their respective workplaces and increases the attractiveness of becoming self‐employed. Using the adoption of right‐to‐work (RTW) laws in Michigan and Indiana as a quasi‐natural experiment, we find that the likelihood of employees becoming self‐employed increased by 53% compared with that of states without RTW laws. Moreover, this tendency is more pronounced for blue‐collar and low‐wage workers who start unincorporated businesses. These findings offer novel insights on the relationship between anti‐labor environments and necessity‐driven entrepreneurship by focusing on individual‐level incentives in non‐knowledge‐intensive sectors.Managerial SummaryChanges in employment conditions influence employees to consider starting their own businesses, yet our understanding of how these changes drive individuals toward entrepreneurship remains limited. This study explores how weakened labor union power affects workers' engagement in entrepreneurial activities, with a focus on the types of employees impacted and the businesses that they start. By examining the adoption of RTW laws in Michigan and Indiana, we find that weakened labor union power disproportionately affects blue‐collar and low‐wage workers, increasing their likelihood of starting unincorporated businesses. These results suggest that managers and policymakers should consider the challenges faced by these workers and how changes in employment conditions may shape their career choices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines CEO pay at nonprofits. Using compensation data for 14,111 nonprofits, we find that CEO pay dropped by 2% after legislation in New York reduced CEOs’ ability to influence their own pay. Despite lower pay, CEOs exerted more effort, and nonprofit performance improved. The effects were stronger at commercial nonprofits than at charities and for male CEOs than female CEOs. These findings are consistent with a model where some nonprofit CEOs derive meaning from their work and compensation can be rigged. Overall, our results suggest that regulation that targets the pay-setting process can improve organizational outcomes at nonprofits. (JEL G30, G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stocks expected to be sold by distressed mega hedge funds (MHFs) face anticipatory institutional selling and increased short interest. However, no evidence of anticipatory trading is found in stocks held by nondistressed MHFs, distressed non-MHFs, or stocks confidentially held by distressed MHFs, suggesting that public portfolio disclosure by large and closely followed distressed investors, and not common investment signals, drives anticipatory trading. Distressed MHFs with greater exposure to such anticipatory trading suffer 2.21% lower style-adjusted returns. Stocks subject to anticipatory trading experience negative abnormal returns followed by reversals, indicating the price destabilizing effect of anticipatory trading. (JEL G12, G20, G23)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a policy prioritizes one person over another, is it because they benefit more, or because they are preferred? This paper develops a method to uncover the values consistent with observed allocation decisions. We estimate how much each individual benefits from an intervention, and then reconcile the allocation with (i) the welfare weights assigned to different people; (ii) heterogeneous treatment edects of the intervention; and (iii) weights on different outcomes. We demonstrate this approach by analyzing Mexico’s PROGRESA anti-poverty program. The analysis reveals that while the program prioritized certain subgroups — such as indigenous households — the fact that those groups benefited more implies that the program did not actually assign them a higher welfare weight. We also find evidence that the policy valued outcomes differently from households. The PROGRESA case illustrates how the method makes it possible to audit existing policies, and to design future policies that better align with values.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent studies suggest monitoring increases during economic downturns. In this study, we test whether firms’ abnormal investment activity changes across the business cycle. Focusing on recessions, we find that firms not only curtail overinvestment but also reduce underinvestment, with the combined effect representing a significant 9% of average investment. Employing various proxies for monitoring intensity, we demonstrate that stronger governance mechanisms are associated with more pronounced reductions in abnormal investment. Importantly, the influence of governance on abnormal investment is magnified during recessions relative to other periods. These results are robust to a wide array of control variables, methodologies, and potential endogeneity concerns. Our findings underscore the time-varying benefits of corporate monitoring and highlight the periods when governance mechanisms may be most effective.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04350 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess the long‐term effects of managerial stress on aging and mortality. Using a difference‐in‐differences design, we apply neural network–based machine‐learning techniques to CEOs' facial images and show that exposure to industry distress shocks during the Great Recession produces visible signs of aging. We estimate a one‐year increase in “apparent” age. Moreover, using data on CEOs since the mid‐1970s, we estimate a 1.1‐year decrease in life expectancy after an industry distress shock, but a two‐year increase when antitakeover laws insulate CEOs from market discipline. The estimated health costs are significant, both in absolute terms and relative to other health risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Young firms' contribution to aggregate employment has been underwhelming. We show that a similar trend is not apparent, however, in their contribution to aggregate sales or stock market capitalization, implying that these firms have exhibited a high average‐to‐marginal revenue product of labor. We study the implications of a gradual shift in the average‐to‐marginal revenue product of labor within a model of dynamic firm heterogeneity. We show that this shift provides (i) a unified explanation for several aspects of the decline in dynamism and (ii) a possible explanation for why large declines in young‐firm employment may have only a moderate effect on aggregate output and consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that incorporating defined benefit pension funds in an incomplete markets asset pricing model improves its ability to match the historical equity premium and riskless rate and has important risk‐sharing implications. We document the importance of the pension fund's size and asset demands, and a new risk channel arising from fluctuations in the fund's returns. We use our calibrated model to study the implications of a shift to an economy with defined contribution plans. The new steady state is characterized by a higher riskless rate and a lower equity premium. Consumption volatility increases for retirees but decreases for workers.</content>

    <title>Beyond Pairwise Network Interactions: Implications for Information Centrality</title>

      <name>Sandro Claudio Lera, Yan Leng</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations and policymakers increasingly rely on network metrics to decide whom to inform, monitor, or support. Yet most networks treat interactions as pairs, even when the underlying activity occurs in groups—project teams, chat channels, meetings, or news articles that mention multiple firms. Collapsing groups into one-to-one links can misidentify who matters. We propose a practical alternative: Model group interactions directly as a hypergraph and compute centrality from a two-step diffusion process that captures how information moves across and within groups. The approach provides a transparent way to incorporate domain knowledge (e.g., whether people enter large or small groups first) and produces testable interpretable rankings. We evaluate the method in three settings—open-source software, a high school interaction study, and financial comentions—and find that hypergraph-based, theory-informed centrality better explains outcomes such as project success, student popularity, and same-day returns than standard graph centralities. For practice and policy, this yields more effective targeting, earlier warning signals, and improved allocation of attention and resources in collaborative work, public health, and market surveillance. We release an open-source Python package (HyperCentral) to support adoption.</content>

    <title>Tight, Loose, or Denied Holding: How Interpersonal Holding Shapes Innovators’ Responses to Innovation Obstacles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovating at work often requires persistence through distressing obstacles and failures. When innovators experience such distress, they may engage colleagues for interpersonal holding—a process in which the colleague (i.e., “holder”) helps contain the innovator’s distress and provides new ways of understanding the obstacle that incited that distress. Prior research has made great strides in explaining what holding processes share in common across different individuals and in different contexts. However, through an inductive study based on 91 semistructured interviews with 74 innovators in a large hospital system, we find significant variation in the dynamics of interpersonal holding. Our analysis uncovered three distinct “interpersonal holding trajectories”—tight holding, loose holding, and denied holding trajectories. At the heart of these trajectories are distinct interpersonal holding episodes. Each episode varies by how holders engage with the innovators’ distress and the obstacles that caused the distress. These distinct episodes uniquely reinforced (or not) our informants’ innovator identities, ultimately influencing divergent responses to the obstacles that they faced. By building theory from the perspective of those who seek holding, our findings highlight important divergences in how interpersonal holding may unfold and identify important implications for innovators and their organizations.Funding: This work was supported by Globoforce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new model of monetary policy implementation to account for two key developments: (i) the introduction of intraday liquidity requirements and (ii) the decreasing relevance of the federal funds market in favor of repurchase agreement (repo) markets with nonbank participants. Our paper studies how liquidity requirements prevent banks from arbitraging between the fed funds and repo markets and generate large repo spikes. We propose a simple measure of excess intraday reserves. Consistent with our theory, this metric is close to zero in 2019Q2, when U.S. repo markets experienced a spike of 400 basis points.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04037 .</content>

    <title>Overcoming Deceptive Evasions in Earnings Calls: The Role of Investor Suspicion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Evasive responses enable managers to escape difficult questions in earnings calls without lying. Although such tactics are common in corporate communication and other important settings, we still know little about how investors and other listeners can avoid being misled by them. Drawing on theories from multiple disciplines, I predict that a common type of nonanswer leads to equivocal interpretations, whereas artful dodges escape detection in earnings calls. However, when investors adopt a suspicious state of mind—characterized by suspended judgment, balanced information search, and consideration of plausible rival possibilities—they are better able to distinguish potentially deceptive evasive tactics from proper responses. My experimental results support these predictions, showing that suspicious thinking allows investors to overcome nonanswers and dodges without punishing adequate responses. I also provide evidence that nonanswers and dodges are unique evasive strategies and that simple interventions aligned with the context of earnings calls can prompt suspicion. These findings contribute to research on the informational role of earnings calls and offer new insights into how suspicion influences deception judgments and into previous research on evasive responses in earnings calls.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The author acknowledges financial support from the Deloitte Foundation, the Roberto C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first comprehensive analysis of directors’ shareholderism: their principled stance toward shareholders and stakeholders in forming strategy. We develop an analytical framework that links shareholderism to individual and institutional factors and test our theoretical predictions using a sample of more than 900 directors originating from 55 countries and serving in 23 countries. Directors’ shareholderism varies according to their individual values; their cultural heritage of egalitarianism, harmony, and embeddedness; and their status as expatriate directors. Directors’ shareholderism does not appear to depend on the distinction between common and civil law. Instrumental variable regressions that address the endogeneity of directors’ expatriate status suggest that expatriates’ and local directors’ shareholderism reflect different cultural emphases. To be effective, current approaches to ensuring corporations do the “right” thing through legal injunctions may need to be mindful of the stability and resilience of individual values and culture.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, business strategy.Funding: A.

    <title>Painful Prices: The Moral Harm Model of Price Fairness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ responses to seller’s prices, including perceptions of price fairness (PPF) and unfairness, are a crucial aspect of the marketplace. Although past literature has uncovered a variety of factors that influence PPF, the lack of an overarching conceptual framework has constrained understanding of when and why consumers are more likely to perceive prices as fair or unfair. The authors develop a conceptual model of PPF as moral judgments and propose that these moral PPF arise from consumer inferences of potential harm from a price. The conceptualization suggests that inferred harm—and thereby, PPF—is influenced by consumer vulnerability, product welfare impact and firm price strategy (e.g., costs and prices, differential pricing, and price promotions). The authors also propose that consumer political orientation and inferred firm self-defense motives moderate the relationship between inferred harm and PPF and that inferred firm motives for prices influence PPF. Eight studies test this conceptualization. The results support the moral harm model and provide novel insights, showing when unchanged prices, price increases, and price decreases are likely to be perceived as more unfair and when differential prices (including paying more than others) are likely to be perceived as fairer than equal prices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds have heterogeneous incentives to engage with portfolio firms. If funds view ESG as a value driver, then these incentives will affect funds’ behavior and thus their impact on firms. We compare ESG funds with similar levels of ESG investments but different incentives to engage. Funds with higher incentives to engage, that is, committed ESG funds, conduct more ESG-related information acquisition, pursue longer term investment strategies, engage more intensely on ESG issues, and have greater real impacts. Moreover, committed ESG funds have outperformed other ESG funds within subportfolios with higher and more effective ESG engagement.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reducing Hospital Procurement Costs through Vendor Contract Optimization: A Decision-Support Framework for GPOs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) play a crucial intermediary role in the U.S. healthcare supply chain by consolidating purchasing power across multiple healthcare providers. However, increasing competition from peer organizations and hospitals’ insourcing efforts has placed significant pressure on GPOs to enhance their value propositions. This study presents a data-driven framework designed to help GPOs reduce medical supply costs for hospitals by addressing inefficiencies in vendor tier contracts, a complex form of quantity discount based on market share rather than absolute quantity. The framework consists of reference matrices that define feasible adjustment spaces for tier prices and thresholds, followed by mixed-integer programming models designed to optimize contract parameters. It enables GPOs to (1) identify misalignments between vendor contracts and hospital operational realities, (2) guide vendors in improving their tier contracts to lower procurement costs for hospitals while supporting their own financial interests, and (3) evaluate the potential for tailoring contracts to individual health systems within existing tier structures to achieve additional savings. Applied to four health systems within a Midwest-based GPO, the model demonstrates up to 50% potential savings compared to current IDN spend and 14% savings relative to the optimal spend under existing tier thresholds. In addition, while prior studies suggest hospital-direct contracts fail to deliver net savings due to high transaction costs, our research shows that some hospitals could potentially benefit from GPO-managed custom contracts.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Bonus Competition in the Gig Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of a gig platform is crucially driven by its ability to compete for labor supply. However, gig workers are independent contractors whose working schedules are not fully controlled by the platform. To overcome this challenge, gig platforms have commonly relied on bonus strategies to drive the participation of gig workers. We study the impact of bonus strategies on gig platforms and their welfare implications. We consider two types of bonus strategies used by gig platforms: 1) fixed bonus that is paid in addition to commissions as long as a service provider participates, and 2) contingent bonus that is paid only if a service provider participates consistently over time. We develop a game theory model to study platform competition with bonus strategies. Our analysis shows that the two types of bonuses will arise in equilibrium under different market conditions. First, when labor supply is thick, fixed bonus will be offered. In this case, fixed bonus improves platform profit by eliminating a prisoner’s dilemma that arises when the platforms compete only on commissions. However, social welfare will be reduced because the utilization of the labor supply is reduced due to the softened platform competition. Second, when labor supply is thin, contingent bonus will be offered. In this case, contingent bonus reduces platform profit because it intensifies platform competition and traps the platforms in a prisoner’s dilemma where they are forced to offer too much bonus. It further causes inefficiency in matching labor supply with demand and hence reduces social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly powerful, but with that power comes greater complexity and opacity. As these models become more sophisticated, they become increasingly difficult to understand—and, crucially, harder to anticipate when and how they might fail. This makes it essential to incorporate their predictions in ways that remain robust to errors. In “Single-Leg Revenue Management with Advice,” S. Balseiro, C. Kroer, and R. Kumar develop an algorithm for the classical single-leg revenue management problem that robustly incorporates predictions. They uncover a fundamental tradeoff: Placing greater trust in predictive models can yield high performance when predictions are accurate but also makes algorithms vulnerable when predictions are off. The proposed algorithm achieves the optimal tradeoff between these goals, allowing decision makers to leverage machine learning predictions while guarding against their potential inaccuracies. By doing so, this work provides a principled approach to integrating powerful yet imperfect forecasts into real-world decision making.</content>

    <title>Residential Battery Storage—Reshaping the Way We Do Electricity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Household investments in renewable energy technologies like rooftop solar and battery storage can be driven by motivations beyond mere financial returns. In “Residential Battery Storage— Reshaping the Way We Do Electricity,” Christian Kaps and Serguei Netessine develop a structural estimation model that separates observed electricity demand from underlying consumption preferences, enabling the estimation of a nonfinancial utility that households derive from using more self-generated solar power rather than grid-procured electricity. The authors call this utility nonmarket valuation; provide evidence that it is driven by sustainability and autarky desires; and link it to the early adoption of residential storage. Applying their model to a novel data set of German households with solar and storage installations, they find that the median household has a nonmarket valuation of 0.29 euros per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that residential storage can have unexpected effects. They show a “rebound effect,” whereby households with storage increase their overall electricity consumption by 4%. Counterintuitively, under Germany’s observed grid mix, residential storage on average increases carbon emissions. However, they also find that demand from the grid decreases by 38% for the average household equipped with solar and storage.</content>

    <title>The Role of Networks in Loan Syndicate Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Several large, well-connected banks jointly underwrite the vast majority of syndicated loans. Although syndication reduces risk by spreading large loans across multiple banks and may benefit borrowers, the process may also facilitate collusive pricing. Disentangling these two effects requires a network view of loan syndicates as traditional measures of market concentration do not capture the collaborative nature of syndication. We find that well-connected banks offer 5- to 15-basis-point-lower loan rates. Well-connected lenders leverage their network position to structure larger, more dispersed syndicates with fewer coarrangers, allowing them to earn higher fee income and reduce their loan risk exposure. We address potential selection biases by exploiting the stickiness in firm-bank relationships and the transfer of credit relationships around forced mergers during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. Using new supervisory data on borrowers’ loan repayment and on-site inspections, we find little evidence that connectedness is related to superior monitoring or performance. Our findings suggest that connectivity is instrumental in lowering loan prices rather than facilitating collusive pricing.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06313 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions on Marketing Decisions and Effectiveness: Evidence from the Biopharma Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) may trigger adjustments to firms’ marketing decisions and their outcomes. Yet, prior literature provides little empirical insight regarding the nature of these adjustments. We address this gap in the context of the biopharma industry, analyzing data on sales, prices, and detailing spending for 375 branded drugs acquired in 73 M&amp;A deals between 2007 and 2020. We find that, on average, acquiring firms (1) reduce detailing spending on target drugs, (2) increase target drug prices, and (3) achieve increases in detailing elasticity for target drugs after the M&amp;A, compared to before. The younger the target drugs and the more experience the acquirer has in marketing drugs in the drugs’ therapeutic category, (1) the more likely we are to see reductions in detailing and increases in prices, and (2) the greater the likelihood that acquirers experience larger increases in detailing elasticity and reductions in price elasticity. For our 375 target drugs, acquirers generated over $23 billion more in revenue in the two post-deal years while spending over $1 billion less on detailing compared to the two pre-deal years. The paper provides a framework for firms regarding commercial returns on M&amp;As and informs the debate on regulatory responses to M&amp;As.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers make individual decisions for their own, others’, and joint consumption. This research introduces a framework for understanding the process of making individual decisions for joint consumption by comparing them to individual decisions for the self and for others (e.g., gifts). Seven experiments show that individual decisions for joint consumption, which involve considering one’s own and others’ preferences, consistently increase felt responsibility for unsatisfactory outcomes and decrease confidence in ability to make satisfactory choices compared to decisions for the self. Knowledge of others’ preferences plays a critical role in differentiating between individual decisions for joint versus others’ consumption; (in)congruent preferences (decrease) increase confidence in decisions for joint consumption, while any knowledge of others’ preferences – regardless of congruity – increases confidence in decisions for others. Three managerially-relevant downstream consequences are identified that differ among individual decisions for joint, self, and others’ consumption: decision anxiety, choice of assortment options, and choice of popular options. These insights offer valuable strategies for marketers to tailor their product offerings and communications to consumers engaged in individual decisions for joint, own, or others’ consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The evolution of innovation ecosystems hinges on the effective coordination between ecosystem leaders and complementors. While ecosystem-sponsored architectural innovations create new technological opportunities for complementors, they may unintentionally disrupt the performance of complementor products that were originally developed based on legacy architectural designs. This study provides empirical evidence of these disruptive effects and explores how complementors’ alignment with the ecosystem leader mitigates such challenges. Focusing on Apple’s release of Core ML—a proprietary artificial intelligence module—in its mobile ecosystem, we employ a difference-in-differences design to investigate variations in complementor performance after adopting this ecosystem-sponsored architectural innovation. Our findings reveal that complementors’ technological and flow alignment with the ecosystem leader is critical for minimizing performance disruptions and enhancing value creation during ecosystem evolution. This study enriches our understanding of architectural changes and complementor heterogeneity in innovation ecosystems.</content>

    <title>Brand Faith: How Spiritual Relationships Develop Between Consumers and Brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers increasingly seek spiritual satisfaction and existential meaning through brands. However, despite the rising prominence of secular forms of spirituality, consumer-brand relationship research largely overlooks the processes by which consumers initiate, develop, and maintain spiritual connections to brands. Using the concept of faith as a theoretical lens, this paper explores how consumer-brand relationships take on spiritual dimensions. Drawing on an interpretive biographic analysis of in-depth interviews and netnographic data, the authors examine spiritual relationship development processes as they unfold between consumers and brands over time. Findings identify five phases of brand faith development (intuition, association, reflection, affirmation, universalization), which progress from initial attraction to deep conviction. Consumers cultivate faith in brands across these phases through a process of believing in, valuing, and committing to a brand as a sacred entity that acts as a center of spiritual meaning. These findings offer a more nuanced understanding of spiritual relationships between consumers and secular brands than current literature provides. The analysis also examines factors that facilitate or inhibit brand faith development, contributing a contextual understanding of brand faith that accounts for influences arising from an interplay between personal, brand, and marketplace factors that affect consumer spirituality.</content>

    <title>Do We Think Differently When Tapping the Screen or Clicking the Mouse? Effects of Computer Interfaces on Level of Construal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The touchscreen has become the de facto interface for individuals to interact with digital devices. This research investigates the implications of the profound shift from the mouse-based, nontouch interface to the touch-based interface for human thinking and behavior. Ten studies reveal that using touchscreens, as opposed to a mouse, fosters a more concrete low-level construal. Specifically, using touch interfaces on devices such as iPads and tablets prompts people to interpret actions in a detailed, hands-on manner, viewing locking a door as inserting a key into a lock rather than as a broader concept such as securing a house. Touchscreens also encourage a narrow categorization of concepts and a reliance on local, granular attributes. The concrete mindset evoked by the touch interface elevates individuals’ preference for practicality over complexity, such as choosing a compact camera over an advanced one, and receptiveness to persuasive attempts with feasibility appeals. Given that mental construals fundamentally influence how we perceive and engage with the world, our findings underscore the wide-ranging impacts of touch interfaces. This research provides a theoretical foundation for exploring the broader implications of the widespread adoption of touch technology, especially as digital devices become increasingly integrated into our digitally transformed daily life worldwide.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how the emergence of digital distribution platforms (DDPs), platforms that facilitate transactions between consumers and incumbents, affects industry structure and competition. Studying the effect of delivery platforms on restaurants in the United States from 2012 to 2018, we show that DDP emergence increases exit and concentration and reduces business dynamism. We provide speculative evidence that these changes are driven by both an increase in inter‐firm competition as well as increased margin pressure from the platform. We show that strategic positioning shapes how establishments experience such changes to competition and that DDP emergence can cause a revaluation of resources within an establishment's business model. This research documents how technology‐enabled intermediaries can disrupt an industry by altering the basis of competition.Managerial AbstractThe emergence of platforms like Grubhub or Instacart that connect consumers to existing incumbent establishments can alter industry structure and within‐industry competition. We study the effect of delivery platforms on restaurants in the United States and show that the emergence of such platforms has increased exit and concentration within the restaurant industry. We present suggestive evidence that these changes are driven by intensified inter‐firm competition and increased margin pressure from the platforms. We then explore which restaurants are better able to weather the emergence of delivery platforms, showing that establishments' strategic positioning and prior investments shape the extent to which delivery platform penetration is beneficial versus detrimental. Through this research, we document how digital distribution platforms can reshape competition within an industry.</content>

    <title>Contract Terms, Employment Shocks, and Default in Credit Cards</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulatory concerns over a tension between expanding financial access and limiting default have led to significant restrictions on contract terms in a number of countries, despite limited evidence on their effectiveness. We use a large nation-wide RCT to examine new borrower responses to changes in interest rates and minimum payments for a credit card that accounted for 15% of all first-time formal loans in Mexico. Default rates were 19% over the 26 month experiment and a 30 pp decrease in interest rates decreased default by 2.5 pp with no effects on the newest borrowers. Doubling minimum payments increased default by 0.8 pp during the experiment but reduced it by 1 pp afterwards, possibly by reducing debt. Matching the experimental sample to their formal employment histories we find that the effect of job separation—more common among new borrowers—on default is seven times larger than the effect of the 30 pp interest rate change. We provide a simple framework for interpreting the experimental results, and rationalize the smaller contract term effects by their limited effects on cash flow rather than by differences in per-peso impacts.</content>

    <title>The Value of Information in a Congested Fishery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model a fishery with potential congestion, in which firms obtain public and private signals about the location of the densest fish stock. We analytically determine the regions of parameter space where greater precision of public and/or private information increases welfare, and we examine the effects of two types of information sharing. Using high-resolution data from the world’s largest fishery, we estimate the structural model. Point estimates imply that more precise private information raises welfare, whereas more precise public information has a negligible effect on welfare. Moreover, welfare is much more sensitive to changes in the precision of private information than to changes in the precision of public information. This difference reflects the fact that public information increases congestion more than private information does. We also find empirically that a small amount of information sharing can reduce welfare, whereas more extensive information sharing raises welfare, as do information clubs.</content>

    <title>Relating Electric Vehicle Charging to Speed Scaling with Job-Specific Speed Limits</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the adoption of electric vehicles emerges a need for coordinated charging strategies to cater to the increased and often synchronized energy demand without violating physical infrastructure limits. Common charging strategies repeatedly solve a corresponding offline problem. In “Relating Electric Vehicle Charging to Speed Scaling with Job-Specific Speed Limits,” Winschermann, Antoniadis, Gerards, Hoogsteen, and Hurink thoroughly analyze that offline problem and present the flow-based offline charging scheduler (FOCS), an algorithm that solves the problem to optimality. The authors continue to quantify the approximation ratio of repeatedly solving the offline problem throughout the day as opposed to solving the offline problem with a priori knowledge of future arrivals. Numerical experiments confirmed that the found worst-case approximation ratio of 4 is far from the achieved empirical ratio of 1.3 when evaluating the ratio for real-world electric vehicle charging instances. Experiments based on that same real-world data show that FOCS only takes seconds to schedule 400 EVs in 15-minute granularity, which is competitive with commercial solvers.</content>

    <title>Fairness and Bias in Online Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fairness in Online Selection ProblemsTwo of the most studied models in online decision making are the secretary problem and the prophet inequality problem. Both capture the challenge of making irrevocable choices under uncertainty. But, what happens when candidates come from different groups and fairness enters the picture? In “Fairness and bias in online selection,” José Correa, Andrés Cristi, Paul Dütting, and Ashkan Norouzi-Fard introduce and analyze multicolor variants of these problems. In these models, each candidate belongs to a “color,” and comparisons are only meaningful within the same color. This captures real-world situations where crossgroup rankings are unreliable or biased—for instance, when evaluating students from different schools or job applicants from diverse backgrounds. For the multicolor secretary problem, the authors characterize the optimal online algorithm. In contrast to the offline optimum—which always selects from the most promising group—the optimal online algorithm is inherently fairer. For the multicolor prophet inequality, they design algorithms that enforce target selection probabilities across groups, ensuring equitable treatment.</content>

    <title>The Check Is in the Mail: Can Disclosure Reduce Late Payments to Suppliers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether buyers reduce their late payments in response to a regulatory change in the United Kingdom that mandates the public disclosure of their payment practices. We find that UK buyers subject to this regulation reduce their late payments. In cross-sectional tests, we find that this reduction in late payments is more pronounced for buyers with a greater extent of late payments, buyers facing a more concentrated supplier base, and buyer-supplier relationships in which a supplier is more important to a buyer than other suppliers. In additional tests, we document evidence consistent with increases in contracting costs for late payers after the disclosure of late payments. Specifically, we find that late-paying buyers experience (i) a loss of suppliers and (ii) a negative stock market reaction. Finally, for buyers subject to the regulation, we document a decrease in operating cash flows, increase in debt, decrease in investment, and decrease in future profitability. Our findings that the disclosure of late payments contains decision-useful information can inform standard-setters, as the FASB and IASB recently mandated new disclosures related to trade credit but omitted mandates for disclosures related to late payments.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06586 .</content>

    <title>Polluting Public Funds: The Effect of Environmental Regulations on Municipal Bonds</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present two findings on how environmental policy uncertainty impacts municipal bond returns. First, yields increase after a new pollution standard is proposed but decrease after this standard is finalized. Second, after annual announcements of compliance status, yields fall for counties that remain in compliance but increase for newly noncompliant counties. We present suggestive evidence linking these short-run municipal bond market reactions to long-run changes in pollution and housing prices. Our findings suggest that increases in either regulatory stringency or uncertainty over future environmental policy increase the cost of municipal debt raised to fund schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02340 .</content>

    <title>Disclosure Costs of Relative Performance Evaluation</title>
    <updated>2025-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Relative performance evaluation has become an increasingly common component of executive compensation contracts. We study how these incentive plans relate to corporate disclosure and predict that they introduce an incremental disclosure cost. This cost arises because disclosures can help competitors make better investment decisions, enhancing their performance and thereby reducing managers’ expected compensation. Consistent with this prediction, we find a negative association between relative performance plans and voluntary value-relevant management forecasts, alongside a positive association with redactions in mandatory filings. This pattern is specific to plans with accounting-based metrics and absent for plans with price-based metrics. The results for price-based metrics are consistent with the idea that the incentive to reduce information asymmetry with market participants outweighs disclosure costs in these plans. The results for accounting-based metrics are more pronounced for managers whose plans provide stronger incentives and for those whose forecasts provide meaningful information spillovers to peers. Overall, this paper contributes the idea that relative performance plans can impose disclosure costs, thereby shedding light on contracting mechanisms that discourage disclosure—a less well-understood aspect of disclosure research.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06200 .</content>

    <title>Base Rate Neglect as a Source of Inaccurate Statistical Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical discrimination relies on people inferring unobservable characteristics of group members based on their beliefs about the group. Across four preregistered experiments (N = 9,002), we show that accurate information about the composition of top performers can induce incorrect beliefs about performance differences across groups when the groups are of unequal size. Because people fail to account for base rates, they underestimate the performance of individuals from smaller groups. As a result, when participants in our experiments receive true information about the gender composition of top performers in a male-dominated candidate pool, they are less likely to hire women, even when there are no gender differences in performance (Study 1). Similarly, they are less likely to hire better-performing non-White candidates when the racial demographics of the candidate pool reflect the U.S. population (Study 4). We show that these choices reflect an error in statistical reasoning, rather than being motivated by a desire to discriminate against any particular group (Study 2). Despite leading to less accurate beliefs, participants disproportionately seek out information about top performers when given the choice, and discrimination thus persists when information selection is endogenous (Study 3).This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00603 .</content>

    <title>On Telemedicine Reimbursements and Hospital Adoption: A Policy Analysis Using Causal Inference Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There continue to be substantial differences in the quality and access to healthcare available to communities across the United States. Researchers have called this the healthcare divide. Telemedicine, a technology‐mediated intervention that promises to bridge this healthcare divide, has been discussed by some as the great leveler. Policymakers, therefore, continue creating legislation that may drive hospitals to adopt telemedicine. Yet, how (or whether) such legislation achieves the goal of telemedicine adoption (and relatedly, healthcare divide reduction) is unclear. In the current study, we investigate a phased introduction of telemedicine reimbursement policies across various states in the United States between 2014 and 2019 to explore the causal effects of such policies on hospital adoption of telemedicine. Results suggest that while reimbursement policies drove the adoption of telemedicine services, this adoption was restricted to inpatient services rather than outpatient ones. We ground our investigation on extant theoretical insights from institutional isomorphism and highlight the limitations in our understanding of the adoption of telemedicine by hospitals in the country.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Buyer's Incentives and Organizational Structure on Suppliers' Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Changes in a buyer organization's incentives and structure can have a significant impact on supply chain performance, such as the quality of sourced components. We examine this relationship using data from a unique quasi‐experiment where one of the two plants of a buyer introduced long‐term quality improvement incentives and a more organic structure for supply chain engineers, while the other plant did not. Analyzing longitudinal component quality data from suppliers to both plants using difference‐in‐differences and triple‐differences methods, we find that (i) the changes in incentives and structure led to differential improvements in supplier quality across the two plants, and (ii) suppliers did not easily transfer quality knowledge gained from one buyer relationship to others. Our paper contributes by showing that organizational redesign by a buyer focused on implicit incentives along with a supportive organic organizational structure can create a learning environment at its suppliers that can help improve the quality of sourced components and the learning generated does not necessarily spill over to other buyers.</content>

    <title>The Internet of Things: Reducing the Bullwhip Effect in Hospital Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how tracking the running times of durable medical equipment connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to estimate the demand for MRO products and consumable supplies (MRO &amp; CS) and lessen the Bullwhip Effect in healthcare supply chains (HSCs). By analyzing a unique data set consisting of orders for medical supplies in a multi‐echelon HSC spanning 12 quarters (3 years), using two‐stage econometric modeling and counterfactual analysis methods, we find that the sharing of these usage and consumption signals significantly improves forecast accuracy, lowers order size, and reduces the bullwhip effects of MRO &amp; CS. We find that the supply chain benefits of tracking equipment running time are amplified by the scope of the relational exchanges between supply chain partners. We analyze the two dominant IoT networking paradigms—Edge and cloud IoT—and find that the benefits of signal sharing are significantly higher under the Edge IoT network. We also find that the tracking of medical equipment has second‐order effects that extend to products whose consumption is correlated with the tracked products. Our research makes important theoretical contributions to the HSC and technology management literatures and provides valuable insights into how emergent technologies can be used to address the distinctive challenges of healthcare supply chains.</content>

    <title>Examining the Impact of Generative AI on Users’ Voluntary Knowledge Contribution: Evidence from A Natural Experiment on Stack Overflow</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice and policy abstractGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping online knowledge-sharing, but its effects on voluntary user contributions remain uncertain. This study examines how the usage of ChatGPT influences users’ answering behavior on Stack Overflow, one of the world’s largest question-and-answer platforms. Using a natural experiment, we find that access to generative AI increases the number of answers users provide, whereas those answers are typically shorter and easier to read. These patterns suggest that users are learning from AI outputs, enabling them to share knowledge more efficiently. However, intensive reliance on AI introduces cognitive strain, which can reduce contribution levels. For practice, our findings underscore the importance for platform owners and managers to strike a balance between AI integration and user support. Encouraging AI-assisted learning can expand participation and improve the accessibility of content, but safeguards are necessary to prevent cognitive overload and ensure the quality of answers. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of establishing clear guidelines for the responsible use of AI in community-driven platforms. By designing thoughtful integration strategies, organizations can harness the benefits of AI—enhancing efficiency and readability—while sustaining authentic, high-quality knowledge contributions.</content>

    <title>Willingness to Pay for Carbon Mitigation: Field Evidence from the Market for Carbon Offsets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) for carbon mitigation from demand for carbon offsets in a field experiment with an online supermarket. The experiment randomizes whether the firm subsidizes the price of the offset or matches the offset’s impact on carbon mitigation. Consumers are price-elastic but fully impact-inelastic, implying that they buy the offset but their WTP for the carbon it mitigates is zero. If the firm informs consumers that it contributes to the offset costs, WTP increases to 16 EUR/tCO$ {}_{2} $. A complementary survey shows that consumers’ stated WTP is 238 EUR/tCO$ {}_{2} $, far above their revealed preferences.</content>

    <title>Policy Diffusion and Polarization across U.S. States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists have studied the impact of numerous state laws, from welfare rules to voting ID requirements. Yet for all this policy evaluation, what do we know about policy diffusion—how these policies are introduced and spread from state to state? We present a series of facts based on a data set of 602 U.S. state policies spanning the past seven decades. First, proxies of state capacity do not predict a higher likelihood of innovating new policies, but the political leaning of the state does predict a higher likelihood of introducing partisan laws since 1990. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity—a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so—as well as similarity in voter policy preferences. Third, since 2000, party alignment has become the strongest predictor of diffusion, and the speed of adoption has increased. Models of learning and correlated preferences can account for the earlier patterns, but the findings for the last two decades indicate a sharply increasing role of party control. We conclude that party polarization has emerged as a key factor recently for policy adoption, plausibly leading to a worse match between state policies and voter preferences.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Hybrid Fleet Management and Vehicle Repositioning in Mobility-as-a-service Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms have revolutionized urban transportation and fundamentally transformed travelers’ experience and engagement, they encounter a significant challenge in maintaining a temporal and spatial balance between supply and demand, particularly with the inclusion of crowd-sourced freelance drivers. In this study, we propose a hybrid supply-side management problem that accounts for heterogeneous revenue dependent on surge pricing, where surge pricing not only determines per-trip earnings but also influences demand elasticity and overall revenue generation. This problem combines the physical repositioning of in-house vehicles with an incentivedriven approach (surge pricing in crowd-sourcing) for freelance vehicles. A multinomial logit (MNL) model is employed to model the repositioning behavior of crowd-sourced drivers, and reformulated as a low-level equilibrium problem embedded in a bi-level program. To characterize the surge price-dependent uncertain demand, a tailored residual-based Wasserstein ambiguity set is constructed within the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. Notably, the proposed residual-based Wasserstein DRO model is demonstrated to satisfy both finite sample guarantee and asymptotic optimality. A linear decision rule (LDR) approximation facilitates a tractable reformulation, and it is shown to incur no loss of optimality for the single-period case. We validate the practical applicability of our model using a dataset from RideAustin, a ride-hailing platform operating in Austin, Texas. We find that the hybrid fleet approach gets the best of both worlds by increasing average revenue using crowd-sourced vehicles and enhancing system robustness using in-house vehicles. Interestingly, we show that a “sweet-spot” may exist as an optimal ratio between the number of in-house and crowd-sourced vehicles that maximizes the overall revenue.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Knowledge Outsourcing from a Consultant: Implications of Absorptive Capacity and Knowledge Reuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a client who has a problem she cannot solve by a given due date, and a consultant engaged to help. The consultant sets the price for knowledge outsourcing to maximize his profit. The client sets the quantity of knowledge outsourcing and the portion of the problem she solves in-house to minimize her cost. The client benefits from knowledge outsourcing only to the extent that she has absorptive capacity to understand and utilize that knowledge. In this context, absorptive capacity is driven by the client’s relevant knowledge and the working relationship between the client and the consultant. We examine how absorptive capacity impacts the key operational decisions of both the client and the consultant. Motivated by the experience of one of the co-authors, we introduce a deterministic model and two stochastic extensions that are critical in industries including semiconductor manufacturing. While we find that more absorptive capacity always reduces the client’s total cost; under certain conditions, the consultant’s profit may deteriorate. If project scope uncertainty exists, we find that, in some competitive environments, the availability of an outsourcing option can indirectly incentivize a client to take on more risk. If project completion time uncertainty exists, we show that a client employs a more experienced consultant and forgoes control of the project to lower her expected total cost. Surprisingly, in a time-based competitive environment, the more experienced consultant increases his price; whereas if time-based competition is limited, the consultant’s price is lower. Lastly, extensive numerical experiments are developed based on the synthesis of the deterministic and the two stochastic models. The numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of the analytical results. Additionally, numerical results are obtained whereby, prior to the start of the game: (i) the client may invest to increase her initial knowledge or (ii) the client and the consultant may invest to improve their working relationship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of late penalties in reducing patient tardiness. Specifically, we evaluate two types of penalties: the last-place penalty (i.e., assigning late-arriving patients to the end of the queue) and the fixed-place penalty (i.e., moving late patients back by a fixed number of positions), under two conditions—absence of a time recommendation and presence of an explicit time recommendation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 9,573 patient visits at a partner hospital in Asia. Our findings indicate that the fixed-place penalty has no significant impact on patient tardiness. In contrast, the last-place penalty significantly reduces patients’ late rate and encourages earlier arrival, particularly when no time recommendation is provided. When combined with a time recommendation, the last-place penalty continues to lower the late rate but does not further shift arrival times earlier. We also find that the lastplace penalty is effective in increasing the patient’s compliance with the time recommendation. We further implemented the last-place penalty in the partner hospital across a broader dataset involving 61,829 visits, yielding consistent results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ privacy choice between withholding and sharing personal data may change during crises. Crises not only alter personal considerations of benefits and costs of this choice, but also trigger societal considerations, such as use of shared data in crisis management. Although the literature on privacy choice has focused on personal considerations, research on how this choice is influenced by broader circumstances remains sparse. We address this topic by leveraging newly available location big data and a global public health crisis as a natural shock. Analyzing 22 billion raw records of intertemporal individual-level mobile location data across a wide spectrum of cities in the United States, we present the first large-scale evidence that opt-out reduces during a crisis, and societal, beyond personal, considerations might have influenced consumers’ privacy choices.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00017 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Auditor Reputation in an Emerging Audit Marketplace: Evidence from Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the role of auditor reputation in driving the value of smart contract audits (SCAs) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Given the lack of regulatory oversight and the risk of cybersecurity breaches against the protocols comprising the DeFi ecosystem, a marketplace has emerged for voluntary on-demand assurance to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts’ coded logic. After documenting that market participants value SCAs and exploring the protocol attributes associated with the demand for smart contract audits, we show that auditor reputation can be established through both advertising (i.e., engagement on Twitter) and the delivery of a high-quality audit, which significantly shape the extent to which an SCA is valued. Additional analyses suggest that the value of an SCA is maximized when both high advertising and high audit quality are present, highlighting the complementary role of these two factors in enhancing auditor reputation. Furthermore, we find that events conceivably damaging the reputation of the auditor (i.e., breaches of protocols recently audited) generate a negative spillover to the auditor’s other recent clients. Overall, our study provides novel insights about the role of auditor reputation in emerging audit markets.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02245 .</content>

    <title>The Dual Brokerage Role of Digital Platforms in the Transition to a Circular Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transition to a circular economy hinges on effective brokerage—the work of intermediaries in connecting innovative closed‐loop recyclers (the niche) with the established waste network (the regime). While brokerage theory and its classicaltertius iungens/gaudenstypology explain how a broker's strategic intent shapes their behaviors, it offers limited insight into how brokers operate at the niche‐regime interface, a context defined by inherent tensions. This inductive study of a digital platform intermediary in the post‐industrial textile waste contexts of Bangladesh and India addresses this by theorizing brokerage as a set of tension‐derived strategies. Our empirical findings identify three tensions: network structure, operational capability, and socially sustainable capability tensions. We then show how the platform addresses these tensions through a dual role:structural brokerage, via semi‐disintermediation, andcapability brokerage, via standardization and legitimization. In addition, the platform engages in identity work to overcome its own challenge of being a new network actor. We contribute a novelcontingent perspectiveon brokerage by unpacking a broker's response to inherent tensions in a transition period. The research also shows how technology‐based intermediaries can be deployed to manage reverse flows, and it furthers understanding of how informal actors can be integrated into formal supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A holistic model encompassing a hospital patient engagement system and its relationship to the quality of provider‐patient interactions is presented. Based on service‐dominant logic, the study examined whether the effects on hospital performance of providers' systemic patient engagement efforts to enable value co‐creation are fully mediated by experiential quality (realized patient engagement). The research model was tested via 2SLS regressions using survey data matched with secondary data. Mediation hypotheses were tested using bootstrapping. The results showed that experiential quality fully mediates the beneficial effects of a hospital patient engagement system on patient recommendation, readmission rate, return on assets, and excess margin. Post hoc tests confirmed the broad applicability of a hospital patient engagement system for reputational and financial advantage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From salespeople and entrepreneurs to politicians and influencers, marketplace actors often communicate with their hands. But despite how integral these movements are to communication, little work in marketing has examined their effects. Might moving one’s hands while speaking increase persuasion? And if so, what types of movements are more impactful, and why? A multimethod investigation, including automated video analysis of thousands of presentations, application of a large multimodal model on almost 200,000 video segments, and preregistered controlled experiments, demonstrates that hand movement can boost impact. Further, the results demonstrate that certain hand gestures (i.e., illustrators) are particularly impactful. By making content easier to understand, using illustrators makes speakers seem more competent, which increases persuasion. Taken together, these findings shed light on hand movement’s impact, deepen understanding around nonverbal communication, and highlight how automated video analysis and multimodal models can provide insights into consumer behavior.</content>

    <title>Beyond Anthropomorphism: Social Presence in Human–&lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Collaboration Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, evolving from reactive tools to proactive collaborators, reshape team dynamics in today's digital workplaces. Text‐based collaboration now frequently involves AI participants that perform tasks traditionally handled by humans, such as creative problem‐solving and decision‐making. This transition has been linked to changes in group dynamics, particularly in relation to social presence, which appears to shape the patterns of productivity and collaboration. We conducted three empirical studies on human–AI teams to investigate the relationship between social presence and willingness to depend on teammates, team‐oriented commitment, and motivation to contribute. Drawing on social presence theory and theory of planned behaviour, our results show that while social presence has a direct association with motivation to contribute, an equally important indirect pathway is associated with human factors like team‐oriented commitment and team members' willingness to depend on each other. We show that while social presence is significantly associated with behavioural intentions, greater AI familiarity and understandability are associated with a stronger relationship, raising questions about the sufficiency of relying solely on anthropomorphic features. Our study contributes to the understanding of human–AI collaboration in social presence research, highlighting the importance of considering social and interpersonal processes in hybrid teams. Our findings have managerial implications for organizations looking to adopt AI‐based systems for collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms face increasing pressure to moderate harmful content while preserving user engagement and free expression. We examine shadowbanning—a strategy that hides content without notifying the user—and compare it to traditional content removal. Our results show that if users only moderately believe that shadowbanning occurs, the platform benefits from a larger user base and higher profit, which also leads to greater social welfare than with content removal or no moderation. Shadowbanning allows the platform to reduce users’ exposure to extreme content without deterring content creators, enabling more participation of users across the extremeness spectrum. However, outcomes depend on user beliefs and the accuracy of moderation technology. When users are highly suspicious of shadowbanning or when moderation tools are significantly imperfect, the platform’s incentives—and the societal benefits—decline. These findings offer practical insights for platform designers and regulators: shadowbanning can be effective, but its benefits hinge on how transparently and accurately it is implemented. Policymakers should account for user perceptions and technological capabilities when evaluating or regulating opaque moderation strategies.</content>

    <title>Evening the Odds in a Gendered Workplace: The Empowering Role of Knowledge Repositories</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations become more diverse, women are increasingly entering traditionally male-dominated technical fields like HVAC repair. However, in these gendered workplaces, women face structural biases that limit their access to the informal knowledge sharing networks crucial for task performance while also encountering significant barriers to promotion and career advancement. This study examines how access to codified organizational knowledge through online repositories can help women circumvent these workplace disadvantages, enabling them to enhance their performance and improve their prospects for professional success. Accessing general knowledge from a knowledge repository on a just-in-time basis helps improve female technician’s performance. These female technicians’ comprehensive information processing approach is the underlying mechanism of why women can better utilize general knowledge in general documents to aid independent problem solving in the field. Also, although women in this male-gendered domain face barrier to promotion, accessing more firm-specific knowledge from problem-solution documents increases their likelihood of being promoted within the firm, helping them mitigate some of the extant bias against women. General knowledge on the other hand helps women find external opportunities for career advancement.</content>

    <title>I‐Deals for Some Employees May (Not) Be Ideal for the Team: Positive and Negative Relationships Between I‐Deals Differentiation and Team Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reflecting a more balanced employer–employee relationship in which employees have latitude to shape aspects of their employment, idiosyncratic deals (i‐deals) are voluntary, personalized, nonstandard agreements that employees negotiate with their employers. In teams, i‐deals differentiation (i‐dealsD), the extent to which the degree of these arrangements varies across members, is a key form of HR differentiation. While research has largely emphasized its negative effects, we propose that the impact of i‐dealsDon team effectiveness depends on the type of i‐deals. We focus on career, flexibility, and task i‐deals, the most common types of i‐deals that employees across different jobs can negotiate with their manager. Drawing on social comparison theory, we argue that career and flexibility i‐dealsDrelate positively to team relationship conflict, and in turn associate with lower customer‐related outcomes. In contrast, task i‐dealsDrelate negatively to team relationship conflict, and subsequently associate positively with customer‐related outcomes. We test our model in two samples: a field study with three‐source data collected from 59 stores of a national restaurant chain located in the United States (Study 1) and a field study with two‐source data collected from 108 teams from three service companies located in China (Study 2). Across both studies, flexibility i‐dealsDand task i‐dealsDhad a negative and a positive association, respectively, with team customer‐related outcomes via team relationship conflict, while career i‐dealsDwas unrelated to our outcomes of interest. We advance the literatures on i‐deals and HR differentiation, and offer practical insights into the implementation of i‐dealsDin teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores how state and religious providers of education compete during the nation building process. Using novel administrative data, we characterize the evolution of Indonesia’s Islamic education system and religious school choice after the introduction of mass public primary schooling in the 1970s. Funded through informal taxation, Islamic schools competed with the state by entering in the same markets. While primary enrollment shifted towards state schools, religious education increased overall as Islamic schools absorbed growing demand for secondary education. In the short run, electoral support for the secular regime weakened in markets with greater public school construction. Over the long run, Islamic schools established at this juncture are more differentiated in terms of religious curriculum, and cohorts exposed to mass public schooling as children are more invested in religion than in the national identity. Our findings offer a new perspective on the political economy of education reforms and the emergence of parallel systems of public goods provision.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why are job polarization and income inequality higher in large U.S. cities? I offer a new explanation: when house prices grow faster in large cities, middle-income households increasingly cannot afford to own a house there. They move to smaller cities and the middle of the income distribution in large cities hollows out, making them more polarized and unequal. I document that (1) cities with higher price growth experienced larger polarization and increase in inequality since 1980 and (2) middle-income households migrate more often to cheaper locations for housing-related reasons than low- or high-income households. Using a spatial equilibrium model with tenure choice and skill heterogeneity, I find that excess growth of prices relative to incomes and rents in large cities accounts for nearly all of the gap in polarization and almost one-half of the gap in inequality growth between large and small cities from 1980 to 2019.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In player-versus-player video games, players’ natural desire to win and avoid losing has created an opportunity for game developers to sell “pay-to-win” add-ons, digital items that give buyers a competitive advantage against other players. In this paper, we investigate the pricing and design of a pay-to-win add-on, its effect on the base game, and profit implications for the developer. When a large share of the players are less price sensitive and highly willing to buy the pay-to-win add-on, we find that, surprisingly, the developer may prefer not to introduce it. Further, when it is optimal to sell the add-on, the developer designs it to be less (more) powerful in games where players are highly (moderately) sensitive to losing. In practice, the developer may design rewards or penalties in the game to influence players’ sensitivities to winning and losing, respectively. Our findings suggest that when selling a pay-to-win add-on, the developer ideally prefers players’ loss sensitivity to be neither too high nor too low, whereas high win sensitivity tends to benefit the developer. The introduction of a pay-to-win add-on influences the optimal pricing and design of the base game. In particular, the developer decreases the base game price and may even sell it as a freemium. Despite the price reduction, investment in game quality may actually increase. From the players’ perspective, our analysis shows that the introduction of a pay-to-win add-on can actually improve player surplus. In an extension of our core model, we show that the developer may prefer to customize player-to-player matching probabilities based on ownership of the pay-to-win add-on, making players who own it more likely to be matched against nonowners. However, such customization is not always optimal, and under some market conditions, the developer may optimally abstain from customizing matching probabilities. In another extension, we show that the developer may benefit from setting a negative price for the base game; counterintuitively, player surplus does not increase from negative pricing.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The web appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04610 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We experimentally study dynamic resource allocation decisions using product development as the context. A product manager must accept or reject a series of design improvement opportunities, given a limited budget. Human subjects perform well when the cost-to-implement is fixed throughout the project. However, in a more complex setting where the cost increases for the latter half of the project, subjects’ performance worsens substantially. We use the strategy frequency estimation method to analyze subjects’ decision mechanisms and find that many subjects are (a) mis-weighting future periods (underweighting in the simple case, overweighting in the complex) and (b) focusing on only the highest value opportunities. These heuristics perform poorly in the complex setting, leading to excess savings and are a counterproductive reaction to the cost increase. Top performers in the complex setting do well by decomposing the problem into two subproblems resembling the simpler setting, which they can handle nearly optimally. In a second study, we test managerial interventions based on prompting this decomposition approach to improve performance in the complex setting. Merely prompting subjects to consider problem decomposition is largely ineffective. However, additionally sharing a “best practice” budget plan that gives information about how and why top performers decompose the problem significantly improves performance. Our results highlight when decision makers will perform well or poorly in a dynamic resource allocation problem and show effective ways to reframe the problem and improve their performance.This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.Funding: The work of D.

    <title>A Global Optimization Algorithm for &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;-Center Clustering of One Billion Samples</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a practical global optimization algorithm for the K-center clustering problem, which aims to select K samples as the cluster centers to minimize the maximum within-cluster distance. Specifically, we propose a reduced-space branch and bound scheme that guarantees convergence to the global optimum in a finite number of steps by only branching on the regions of centers. To improve efficiency, we design a two-stage decomposable lower bound, the solution of which can be derived in a closed form. In addition, we also propose several structure-exploiting acceleration techniques to narrow down the region of centers, including bounds tightening, sample reduction, and parallelization. Extensive studies on synthetic and real-world data sets have demonstrated that our algorithm can solve the K-center problems to global optimal within four hours for 10 million samples in the serial mode and 1 billion samples in the parallel mode, whereas existing studies can only address small-scale problems (e.g., thousands of samples). Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art heuristic methods, the global optimum obtained by our algorithm reduces the objective function by an average of 25.8% on these synthetic and real-world data sets.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2019-05499].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00218 .</content>

    <title>How Do Chief Executive Officers Make Strategy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey 262 chief executive officer (CEO) alumni of Harvard Business School and gather evidence on three aspects of each executive’s strategy practice: how formalized it is, how it is developed, and how it is implemented. We report three main results. First, firms with higher adoption of structured strategy practices outperform their peers; they grow faster and are more profitable, especially in industries with greater strategic complexity. Second, the appointment of CEOs with more structured styles appears to drive this outperformance, not firm-specific effects. This raises the question of how an executive comes to adopt more structured strategy practices. Our third finding provides a partial answer; business education can have a lasting impact on a CEO’s strategy practices as evidenced by a regression discontinuity analysis centered around a curriculum change at Harvard Business School.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: Financial support was provided by Harvard Business School.

    <title>Green Bonds: Reputational Bonding via Media Coverage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on prior literature showing that green bond issuance signals a firm’s environmental commitment, this paper provides empirical evidence on a mechanism that gives credibility to this signal: reputational bonding through increased media coverage. Compared with matched firms, media coverage of a firm’s environmental performance increases significantly after issuing green bonds. This increase persists over time and extends to aspects of environmental performance that go beyond the contractual obligations of the green bond. Although this result is more pronounced for positive news, the increase in negative news is significantly larger for green bond issuers with environmental controversies after green bond issuance. Cross-sectional analyses show that this media coverage increase is concentrated among green bond issuers that are larger, listed on green bond exchanges, and in countries with weaker institutional oversight of environmental issues. To shed light on the effectiveness of this reputational bonding mechanism, I find that higher media attention following green bond issuance is associated with higher environmental performance.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of venture capital (VC) firms in private mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) contracting, particularly in reducing information asymmetry. Analyzing a proprietary data set of 851 startup acquisitions from 2015 to 2020, I find that M&amp;A contracts are significantly less likely to include earnouts, mechanisms designed to mitigate information asymmetry, when a VC is involved in the transaction. Further analysis reveals that earnouts are more likely in transactions with high information asymmetry between the VC and the buyer. The study also examines the effect of prior relationships between VCs and buyers, showing that these connections not only increase the chances of repeat transactions but also further reduce the reliance on earnouts. These findings suggest that VCs play a crucial role in mitigating information asymmetry, reducing the need for earnouts, and ultimately improving M&amp;A outcomes.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Research funding was provided by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00654 .</content>

    <title>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: Managing Uncertainties in Outcomes, Deliverables, and Means in Behavioral Intervention Development Projects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We take an extended perspective on project success that includespost‐projectoutcomes as well asat‐endandduring‐projectsuccess. To manage projects accordingly, we conceptualize three corresponding orders of uncertainty (outcomes,deliverables, andmeans uncertainties). We study 11 cases of behavioral intervention development (BID) projects to explore how managers handle each of the three orders of uncertainty to achieve post‐project success—fully, partially, or not at all. Our analysis suggests several key insights. The hierarchical nature of multi‐order uncertainty management implies that decreasing a higher‐order uncertainty (e.g., outcomes) increases the next‐lower order (e.g., deliverables). In the studied cases, reducingoutcomes uncertaintytended to increasedeliverablesandmeans uncertainties—causing one step forward to seem like two steps backward. Thus, the sequence of uncertainty‐management activities matters, with post‐project success linked to reducingoutcomes uncertaintybeforedeliverablesandmeans uncertainties. Violations of this sequencing were associated withuncertainty masking, a failure to acknowledge uncertainty that misdirected uncertainty‐management activities. Moreover, the uncertainty‐management activities must be timely, lest they become misaligned with other project activities. These findings elaborate the theorized relationships between uncertainty management and project success. We further outline how project managers can manage uncertainty byreframingoutcomes,rescopingdeliverables, andreplanningmeans.</content>

    <title>Improvising for Learning: How and When Firm‐Level &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Systems Drive Team Exploratory and Exploitative Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly rely on teams to balance innovation and efficiency by simultaneously engaging in exploratory and exploitative learning. However, the cross‐level mechanisms through which firm‐level systems enable such ambidextrous capabilities at the team level remain insufficiently understood. This study develops and tests a multilevel contingency framework that explains how change‐oriented human resource management (HRM) systems foster both forms of team learning through team improvisation—a dual‐purpose capability that integrates real‐time responsiveness with adaptive refinement. Drawing on multisource, time‐lagged data from 205 new product development (NPD) teams nested within 75 pharmaceutical firms, we find that team improvisation mediates the cross‐level relationship between change‐oriented HRM systems and both exploratory and exploitative learning. Furthermore, this mediating effect is contingent upon the nature of intra‐team knowledge sharing: tacit knowledge sharing amplifies the relationship between improvisation and exploratory learning, while explicit knowledge sharing enhances its link with exploitative learning. Our findings offer theoretical insight into how HRM systems cascade across organizational levels to shape team capabilities, advancing perspectives that conceptualize ambidexterity as an emergent property of behavioral routines rather than structural design. Situated within a politically and economically constrained environment, this study also underscores the heightened strategic value of HRM systems in enabling adaptability and innovation under institutional adversity.</content>

    <title>Label claims and category work: The appropriation of the “digital” label in the IT services industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New labels with symbolic value may constitute a strategic resource for firms in established market categories, but these labels must also provide audiences with classificatory utility. We explore this tension and develop a process explanation of how firms in established market categories appropriate new labels under audience scrutiny. Analyzing eleven years (2011–2022) of earnings calls transcripts of eight leading Information Technology services firms, we theorize around their interest in appropriating the label ‘digital.’ We find that such appropriation is shaped by category work – forged in the tension between contrary impulses of the firm and the audience, and enacted through their claims, probes, and claim calibrations. We also highlight the symbolic appropriation dilemma and the unintended consequences of label appropriation for incumbents in established market categories.Managerial SummaryIncumbent firms in established market categories may strive to satisfy their stakeholders' demands for demonstration of both continuity and novelty by developing symbolic management strategies. In doing so, these incumbents may come to view novel category labels as valuable resources for symbolic action. However, the incumbent's pursuit of symbolic action in an established market category is often constrained by the conservative scrutiny of securities analysts. Our study of the global Information Technology services industry reveals the mechanisms of claim calibration deployed by executives to evade or blunt analyst scrutiny while appropriating the digital label. Our study also alerts leading incumbent firms to a dilemma of symbolic management that compels them to confront the trade‐off between symbolic appropriability and symbolic flexibility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trade wars and financial sanctions are again becoming an increasingly common part of the international economic landscape, and the dynamics of the exchange rate are often used in real time to evaluate the effectiveness of sanctions and policy responses. We show that sanctions limiting a country's exports or freezing its assets depreciate the exchange rate, while sanctions limiting imports appreciate it, even when both types of policies have exactly the same effect on real allocations, including household welfare and government fiscal revenues. Beyond the direct effect from sanctions, increased precautionary savings in foreign currency also depreciate the exchange rate when they are not offset by the sale of official reserves or financial repression of foreign-currency savings. We show that the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 are quantitatively consistent with the combined effects of these forces calibrated to the observed sanctions and government policies. We evaluate the associated welfare, fiscal and inflationary consequences for both Russia and the coalition of Western countries.</content>

    <title>Ripples in the Pond: Product Portfolio Reconfiguration and Dynamism in the Competitive Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The management literature often overlooks how firms can alter the competitive landscape without introducing groundbreaking changes or innovations. Applying the awareness, motivation, and capability framework from competitive dynamics, we posit that as a firm intensifies its product portfolio reconfiguration, its rivals become increasingly aware and motivated to respond, creating a ripple effect that accelerates change in the competitive environment. However, extreme reconfigurations may decrease rivals’ motivation due to the costly and disruptive nature of keeping pace. We also argue that rivals will be more motivated to respond to reconfigurations from a firm with high customer orientation and when they possess financial slack. Using a longitudinal dataset of 6382 firms’ product portfolios and those of their rivals, we find support for these arguments. This study contributes to competitive dynamics research by expanding the focus to a firm’s entire set of rivals and highlighting how a firm’s competitive moves can result in ripple effects throughout its rival network. We also demonstrate how moderate organizational changes can quickly lead to increased environmental dynamism, an overlooked avenue in research of dynamism. Finally, we suggest that a broadened competitive dynamics perspective rooted in Austrian economics can enhance our understanding of firm adaptation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses the growing misalignment between traditional human resource management (HRM) systems and the realities of distributed, fluid, and fragmented work. To address this issue, we introduce the FLUID‐HRM framework—a layered design architecture that reconfigures core HRM domains (resourcing, rewards, development, relations, work systems) across onsite, hybrid, and distributed forms of work. The framework is anchored in five structural principles of fluidity: spatial flexibility, temporal desynchronization, employment multiplicity, identity fragmentation, and digital mediation. For each, we propose differentiated HRM responses and corresponding information system (IS) infrastructures. Rather than retrofitting core legacy models, FLUID‐HRM offers a principle‐based approach for designing ethical, effective, and inclusive people systems in boundaryless work environments. By linking structural challenges to HRM innovation, we extend foundational HRM theory and provide actionable guidance for organizations navigating the transformation of work.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While theories at the crossroads of social movements and organizations have explored different strategies and challenges faced by insider and outsider activists, research examining their collaborations is just emerging. We contribute to this literature by introducing the concept of collaborative division of labor, which theorizes how social movement organizations (SMOs) collaborate through adoption of different roles, leveraging their distinct positions (insiders, outsiders, belonging to different sectors), postures (persuasive or disruptive), and expertise to pursue a common political agenda. Through a study of the LGBT movement in French workplaces, we examine the interactions among eight SMOs with regard to four strategies: amplifying one another’s actions, compelling organizations to respond, threatening organizations’ reputations, and engaging in complementary datactivism (the production and dissemination of data for a social movement cause). Our findings show that SMOs’ division of labor relied on multidirectional collaborations, as activists adopted roles that provided complementary, unidirectional, mutually beneficial, and indirect support to one another. In addition, our research offers counterintuitive insights about the postures of insider and outsider activists, as we argue that these postures do not always align with what is expected in the literature. Last, we reveal how this collaborative division of labor led to several intermediate outcomes, thereby enhancing our understanding of the effects of interactions that go beyond competitive dynamics among groups within the same movement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of childhood cultural upbringing on financial advisor misconduct using novel data on advisors’ childhood addresses. We find that an advisor’s childhood location significantly predicts misconduct, with exposure to misbehavior culture during childhood playing a stronger role than exposure during adulthood. Addressing endogeneity concerns, we conduct several tests that support the notion that our results reflect cultural exposure rather than advisors’ employment choices, location preferences, local conditions, family characteristics, or clientele characteristics. Our findings underscore the formative influence of culture in shaping financial advisors’ personal ethics and could help us understand and prevent financial misconduct.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rising student loan debt and concerns over unaffordable payments provide rationale for “income-driven repayment” (IDR) plans, which aim to protect borrowers from default and resulting financial consequences by linking payments to income. We estimate the causal effect of IDR payment burdens on loan repayment and attainment for several cohorts of first-time IDR applicants using a regression discontinuity design. Borrowers who are not required to make payments experience short-run reductions in delinquency and default risk, primarily because of lower costs of inattention, but this effect fades over the longer run as some borrowers become disconnected from the student loan repayment system.

    <title>The Impact of EITC on Education, Labour Market Trajectories, and Inequalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a complement to the federal earned income tax credit (EITC), some states offer their own EITC, typically calculated as a percentage of the federal EITC. In this paper, we analyse the effect of state EITC on education using policy discontinuities at US state borders. Our estimates reveal that an increase in the state EITC leads to a statistically significant increase in the high school dropout rate. We then use a life-cycle matching model with directed search and endogenous educational choices, search intensities, hirings, hours worked, and separations to investigate the effects of EITC on the labour market in the long run and along the transitional dynamics. We show that a tax credit targeted at low-wage (and low-skilled) workers reduces the relative return to schooling, thereby generating a powerful disincentive to pursue long-term studies. In the long run, this results in an increase in the proportion of low-skilled workers in the economy, which may have important implications for employment, productivity, and income inequality. Finally, we use the model to determine the optimal design of the EITC.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information platforms have emerged in the developing world to improve price transparency and welfare for smallholder suppliers. Meanwhile, sustaining welfare improvement often requires such platforms to benefit both suppliers and buyers. This paper studies the impact of price transparency on market price and welfare in smallholder supply chains, and identifies conditions and driving forces for creating benefits to both suppliers and buyers. Motivated by granular data from smallholder supply chains, we develop a new Hotelling model of price search, where price-setting buyers face the operational challenges of demand asymmetry and costly underage or overage amid uncertain supply. We find that high overage costs, combined with high demand asymmetry that dominates random supply variations, give rise to two-sided benefits, driven by price competition benefiting the suppliers and demand signaling benefiting the buyers under increased transparency. Moreover, achieving two-sided benefit requires implementing a well-chosen level of price transparency, and, in some cases, creating a low uncertainty environment for buyers. These results help close the gap between the empirical literature and the theoretical economic literature on this topic, and offer possible explanations for the variation in empirical findings. We provide managerial recommendations for information platform designers, including for our partnering platform, on identifying the target markets and whether to implement full or partial transparency.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by Stanford King Center on Global Development, Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), and Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01617 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the role of vertical incentives between upstream issuers and downstream brokers in the retail bond market when there exist agency problems. Although arms-length transaction regulations require that vertical incentives not influence their activities, I show that both upstream issuers and downstream brokers are sensitive to vertical incentives. I then present a structural model in order to measure the degree of vertical incentives for downstream brokers, controlling for the extent of agency problems. The structural estimates show that brokers are willing to give up one dollar of their own profit if their vertically integrated issuer’s profit goes up by 1.25 dollars.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03572 .</content>

    <title>The Consequences to Directors for Deploying Poison Pills</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using director-specific, within-firm variation in poison pills, we find that pill-adopting nonexecutive directors experience a decrease in shareholder votes, an increase in termination rates across all their directorships, and a decrease in the likelihood of new board appointments. These consequences are not because of poor firm performance, active bid resistance, or hedge fund activism, and accrue especially when the adopted pill is relatively costly to the firm. Firms have positive stock price reactions when pill-associated directors die unexpectedly, compared with negative returns for other directors. We conclude that pill-adopting directors experience a decrease in the value of their services.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03558 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how relationship lending affects the transmission of bankruptcy reforms on credit terms and bank enforcement mechanisms, using a unique database containing the universe of credits of a large Italian bank. Lower creditor rights lead the bank to reduce expected recovery rates, worsen credit terms, and tighten bank enforcement actions. Bank-borrower power dampens the terms’ impact at the cost of tougher borrower renegotiations. Older and more credit-dependent borrowers receive less unfavorable terms but see larger increases in credit suspensions and legal actions. Results suggest that policies curbing credit enforcement weaken the role of bank power in dampening economic shocks.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers often face the challenge of protecting parent brand equity when launching brand extensions into low–fit categories. This article recommends that managers can minimize any negative impact of low fit extensions by using a unique segmentation strategy as well as framing the extension fit in terms of brand personality. Specifically, this research introduces person–thing orientation as a framework in the brand extension context to effectively segment consumers based on their environmental orientation. Person-oriented individuals selectively examine the environment and direct their attention towards people and social relationships. Thing-oriented individuals primarily focus on objects and their functionality. We demonstrate that thing-oriented consumers are less likely to exhibit negative feedback effects. Person-oriented consumers respond positively when low–fit extensions align with the parent brand’s personality. Importantly, we demonstrate that person thing orientation can be leveraged managerially through observable proxies (e.g., college major, media context). These findings offer actionable insights for tailoring brand extension strategies to target the right audience, frame extensions effectively, and minimize parent brand dilution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper establishes that mutual funds strategically time their trades in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) stocks around disclosure dates to inflate their sustainability ratings. This claim is supported by three empirical findings. First, we show that funds' ESG betas increase shortly before disclosure and decrease shortly afterwards. Second, we document that post‐disclosure fund returns are higher but have lower ESG exposure than disclosed portfolios. Third, we provide evidence that ESG stock prices temporarily rise before disclosure and decline afterwards. Overall, we establish that green window dressing positively impacts fund sustainability ratings, performance, and flows.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study exchange rate expectations in surveys of financial professionals and find that they successfully forecast currency appreciation at the two‐year horizon, both in and out of sample. Exchange rate expectations are also interpretable, in the sense that three macro‐finance variables—the risk‐neutral covariance between the exchange rate and equity market, the real exchange rate, and the current account relative to GDP—explain most of their variation. There is no “secret sauce,” however, in expectations: After controlling for the three macro‐finance variables, the residual information in survey expectations does not forecast currency appreciation in our sample.</content>

    <title>Market Transition and Entrepreneurial Beliefs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how societal-level institutional changes, specifically market transition in emerging economies such as China, shape entrepreneurial beliefs. While market transition is typically expected to foster rationalization and professionalism, thus diminishing traditional beliefs such as familism and nepotism, real-world observations suggest an opposite trend. To address this puzzle, we argue that, while market transition can facilitate the development of formal institutions, it also has unanticipated consequences, that is, a decline in social trust and an increase in psychological uncertainty, thus prompting entrepreneurs to adhere to traditional beliefs rather than adopt modern ones. In addition, we contend that entrepreneurs’ social origins moderate the impact of market transition on their beliefs because, as a key stratification mechanism, they can shape entrepreneurs’ vulnerability to declining social trust and heightened psychological uncertainty. Our analysis of national survey data on Chinese private entrepreneurs supports these arguments, thus offering a more nuanced understanding of how market transition influences entrepreneurial cognition and behavior and explaining the persistence of traditional beliefs despite market reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This methodological brief explains why and how family business research should account for public/private ownership to better understand how family control and influence affect firm outcomes. To support our arguments, we review the methodologies used in family business studies and identify four methodological pitfalls that obscure heterogeneity in family firm private/public ownership. We propose practical solutions to address those pitfalls and apply them to a recent study, showing how accounting for private/public ownership alters its empirical findings. The implication of our brief is that more fine-grained methodological attention to public/private family firm ownership will enhance family business research.</content>

    <title>The Surrogate Index: Combining Short-Term Proxies to Estimate Long-Term Treatment Effects more Rapidly and Precisely</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common challenge in estimating the impact of interventions (e.g., job training programs, educational programs) is that many outcomes of interest (e.g., lifetime earnings or other labor market outcomes) are observed with a long delay. In biomedical settings this is often addressed by using short-term outcomes as so-called “surrogates” for the outcome of interest, e.g., tumor size as a surrogate for mortality in cancer studies. We build on this literature by combining multiple, possibly qualitatively distinct, short-term outcomes (e.g., short-run earnings and employment indicators) systematically into a “surrogate index.” Under the Prentice surrogacy assumption, which requires that the primary outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogates, we show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome. We also relate the surrogacy assumption to a set of structural, causal assumptions. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of each of the key assumptions, and we provide simple methods to validate these assumptions using additional observed outcomes. We apply our method to analyze the long-term impacts of a multi-site job training experiment in California. Rather than waiting a full nine years to directly observe the long-term impact, we show that it is possible to use short-term (the first six quarters) outcomes as surrogates. One could have estimated the program’s long-term impacts on mean employment rates using the employment rates observed in the first six quarters, with a 35% reduction in standard errors.</content>

    <title>Reskilling the Workforce for AI: Domain Expertise and Algorithmic Literacy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides evidence that AI and algorithms act as complements to domain expertise, creating the greatest value when algorithmic literacy is broadly diffused among workers. Unlike earlier business technologies that concentrated expertise in IT specialists, AI and algorithms are most effective when domain experts themselves can interpret and apply them. Using two workforce datasets, I show that demand for algorithmic skills is rising among domain experts, frontier firms diffuse these skills broadly, and markets reward firms’ AI and algorithmic investments more when such capabilities are dispersed. The spread of no-code and natural language tools accelerates this shift by lowering barriers to use and allowing domain experts to integrate algorithms into their decision-making processes. These patterns underscore the importance of workforce training and organizational design in realizing productivity gains from AI adoption.This paper has been accepted by D. J.

    <title>Optimal Interventions for Increasing Healthy Food Consumption Among Low-Income Populations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than $60 billion per year in the United States is spent on policies aimed to increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption among low-income households. Many of these policy interventions are either monetary (e.g., financial incentives) or education related. The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of these interventions through a more strategic and personalized allocation of funds. This paper introduces a consumer behavioral model for grocery shopping decisions, which is nested into the policymaker’s upper-level optimization problem. The policymaker’s goal is to ensure that the FV spending of all consumers in a given population exceeds a specified threshold by utilizing a small strategic set of different intervention bundles—combinations of monetary and education-related interventions. Although an exact solution to the upper-level problem is intractable, we provide an analytical upper bound on the number of intervention bundles needed to achieve the policymaker’s goal, as well as a method for constructing these intervention bundles and assigning them to individuals based on their characteristics. We demonstrate the practicality of the model and approach using the low-income households in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s FoodAPS data set.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, management science.Funding: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under [Grant 1745302].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02324 .</content>

    <title>Long Goodbyes: How Do Private Equity Funds Manage Sell-Downs After Initial Public Offerings?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how private equity funds (general partners (GPs)) sell down their stakes in companies they take public. GPs earn private equity management fees and carried interest on public equity holdings. The average duration of post–initial public offering (IPO) holdings is three years, whereas lockups expire after six months. Private equity–backed IPOs perform well during the lockup, but we find no evidence that GPs add value for investors through the timing of their aftermarket sell-down strategies. GPs appear reluctant to sell losers, consistent with behavioral biases and agency effects. Long goodbyes are more likely when the fund is performing better, resulting in higher payments to GPs.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivanisha, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02043 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we move beyond the prevailing view of artificial intelligence (AI) as an independent entity within organizations, which, we argue, risks obscuring potential explanations of the effects of AI on organizing. Drawing on posthumanism, we propose an ontological shift in conceptualizing AI. We theorize that, instead of residing within algorithmic actors, AI arises from the relations among human and algorithmic actors as an organizing capability. This capability is characterized by connectivity, codependence, and emergence as core properties, and contributes to organizational analysing, learning, and acting in pursuit of organizational goals. The shift from the entity view to the organizing capability view of AI has significant implications for understanding its organizational effects and opens new avenues for research in human‐algorithm collaboration, algorithmic management, and organizational intelligence, while counterbalancing tendencies to treat AI as autonomous agents.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Short‐sale costs eliminate the abnormal returns on asset pricing anomaly portfolios. While many anomalies persist out‐of‐sample before accounting for short‐sale costs, they cannot be exploited with long‐short strategies due to stock borrow fees. Using a comprehensive sample of 162 anomalies, the average long‐short portfolio return is a significant 0.14% per month before short‐sale costs, and the returns are due to the short leg. However, the average is −0.01% once returns are adjusted for borrow fees. Moreover, anomalies are not profitable even before fees if the high‐fee observations, representing 12% of stock dates, are excluded from the analysis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the expected consequences of negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news on firms' future profits. After learning about negative ESG news, analysts significantly downgrade their forecasts at short and longer horizons. Negative ESG news affects forecasts more strongly at longer horizons than other types of negative corporate news. The negative revisions of earnings forecasts following negative ESG news largely reflect expectations of lower future sales, rather than higher future costs. Quantitatively, forecast revisions can explain most of the negative impacts of ESG news on firm value. Analysts are correct to revise forecasts downward following negative ESG news.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows that investors acquire and process less firm‐specific information on days when many firms announce earnings (hereafter earnings clusters). We show that investors gather moremacroeconomicinformation during earnings clusters, that this behavior is amplified during negative economic shocks and concurrent macroeconomic announcements, and that these information acquisition patterns have implications for equity valuations. Our findings are consistent with the benefit of extracting macroeconomic information from earnings announcements increasing during earnings clusters, which we confirm empirically. Thus, our results help explain why investors focus less on individual firm news during earnings clusters: They rationally redirect their attention to the most beneficial information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study plaintiff law firms in corporate litigation, focusing on “star” firms that dominate settlement outcomes. Stars are associated with larger settlements; however, much of this effect is predicted by the defendant's litigation insurance coverage, suggesting assortative matching of stars with lawsuits that have ex ante larger expected payoffs. Moreover, stars charge higher fees for a given settlement size. Additional tests suggest that visibility and information asymmetry vis‐à‐vis less sophisticated plaintiffs help sustain the stars’ market share. These findings advance our understanding of corporate litigation and the agency relationship between plaintiff law firms and their clients.</content>
