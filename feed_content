    <title>Are less hierarchical firms organized around stronger cultures? Evidence from big data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are less hierarchical firms organized around stronger cultures instead? We analyze 1.5 million employee reviews on Glassdoor.com from 23,000 US‐based firms, alongside data on managerial hierarchy estimated from 42 million professional social media profiles. Our findings confirm a negative association between managerial hierarchy and organizational culture strength. We explore two potential explanations for this association: Functional equivalence between the two, and culture fragmentation caused by managerial hierarchy. Multiple correlational tests show support for functional equivalence as a plausible explanation for the observed negative correlation. Our findings enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between organizational structure and culture utilizing Big Data methods.Managerial SummaryCan strong cultures, i.e., systems of widely shared beliefs and values converging on a few organizational dimensions, be an alternative to managerial hierarchy to align the work of employees? Our analysis of 1.5 million Glassdoor employee reviews and 42 million professional profiles from 23,000 U.S. firms shows  that organizations with stronger cultures do indeed have a lower fraction of managers to total employees. This suggests that attempts to “flatten” hierarchies by eliminating layers of managers is more likely to succeed if accompanied by efforts to build strong cultures, through mechanisms such as careful selection and socialization of workers.</content>

    <title>Banning Unsolicited Store Flyers: Does Helping the Environment Hurt Retailing?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a ban on unsolicited store flyers in seven Dutch municipalities that shifted from an opt-out to an opt-in policy between 2018 and 2020. Despite a 50% drop in flyer distribution, household grocery shopping behavior remained largely unchanged. The findings suggest that reducing flyer waste may be possible without substantially disrupting shopping behavior.</content>

    <title>On Greedy-Like Policies in Online Matching with Reusable Network Resources and Decaying Rewards</title>
    <updated>2025-10-20T13:38:57+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>David Simchi-Levi, Zeyu Zheng, Feng Zhu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a unified modeling framework for classical online matching problems and emerging online matching problems with three additional practical features: reusable resources, network resources, and decaying rewards. For online matching problems in the unified framework, we provide a unified performance analysis tool for the greedy policy and its simple variants, which we refer to as greedy-like policies. We prove that greedy-like policies can achieve near-optimal performances for online matching problems in the unified framework, where the policy performance is measured by competitive ratios under adversarial environments. We then analyze several representative special classes of online matching problems, which incorporate additional realistic structural assumptions on top of the unified framework. Specifically, we consider online matching problems with each of the following three additional structures: (i) singleton resources with time-decaying rewards; (ii) network resources with accept/reject decisions; and (iii) network resources with interval-type bundles. We show that for these special classes of online matching problems, slight modifications to greedy-like policies can successfully utilize additional structural information to further enhance policy performances. This work may suggest that the greedy policy and its variants, despite its simplicity, can achieve reliable performances for a number of emerging online matching problems.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>How Do Domestic and Foreign Firms Respond to a Reduction in Competition from the Public Sector? Evidence from Vaccine Markets in India</title>
    <updated>2025-10-20T13:38:57+00:00</updated>

      <name>Arzi Adbi, Anant Mishra, Chirantan Chatterjee</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how domestic and foreign firms in the private sector respond to a reduction in competition from the public sector. Our analysis exploits the sudden suspension of production licenses of vaccine-manufacturing public sector units (PSUs) in January 2008 in India, home to more than 1.2 billion people at that time. Although the suspension presented a window of opportunity for private sector firms, the opportunity was laden with high uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we find that the suspension was associated with revenue gains driven by new product introductions and that these gains persist even after the supply suspension revocation in February 2010. Importantly, unlike domestic firms, foreign firms gain little. We explore potential mechanisms and find evidence consistent with one of them being the major reason for the differing impact: Domestic firms better navigate the challenges arising from political pluralism, an institutional feature characterized by a lack of political alignment between national and subnational governments. In the presence of political alignment, domestic firms do not have a comparative advantage over foreign firms. Our evidence thus highlights that even an uncertain and transitory window of opportunity arising from a controversial reduction in competition from the public sector can lead to a fundamental market restructuring in ways that can diverge from the intended policy objective. In particular, domestic firms’ ability to manage political pluralism is a core mechanism explaining their comparative advantage over foreign firms in the wake of a national crisis.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Start-Up Research Grant A-0003843-00-00], the University of Minnesota [Summer Research Grant], and the Indian School of Business [Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06174 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of On-the-Job Experience on Base-Rate Neglect: Evidence from Medical Professionals</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect.This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Lehigh University [FRG Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05461 .</content>

    <title>The Effects of MiFID II on Voluntary Disclosure</title>
    <updated>2025-10-20T13:38:57+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II’s controversial unbundling provision on corporate voluntary disclosure. Although prior research has largely focused on changes in sell-side research post-MiFID II, changes in voluntary disclosure and their effects on the information environment are less known. We find that European Union (EU) firms significantly increased the propensity and frequency of management earnings guidance issuance after MiFID II enactment. This effect is more pronounced among firms experiencing a decline in the quantity of sell-side research or a reduction in the consumption and dissemination of analyst reports and is more muted among firms witnessing improvements in research quality. Furthermore, we find that post-MiFID earnings guidance by EU firms becomes more thorough and elicits stronger market reactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the increased guidance effectively alleviates the negative liquidity effects of MiFID II. Collectively, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the efficacy of MiFID II’s unbundling provision by providing evidence that voluntary disclosure plays a key role in mitigating the unintended net negative consequences on the information environment following the regulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: Financial support from the New York University Stern School of Business, Seoul National University, the Baruch College Zicklin School of Business, and George Washington University is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Can Socially Minded Governance Control the Artificial General Intelligence Beast?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealized conditions that presume that the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI, even if this does not maximize profits. It is demonstrated that a socially minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimize harm from AGI that unrestricted products released by for-profit firms might create. The reason is that a socially minded entity can only minimize the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms at a prohibitive financial cost and so, does not preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine data (MD), that is, data generated by machines, are increasingly gaining importance, potentially surpassing the value of the extensively discussed personal data. We present a theoretical analysis of the MD market, addressing challenges such as data fragmentation, ambiguous property rights, and the public-good nature of MD. We consider machine users producing data and data aggregators providing MD analytics services (e.g., with digital twins for real-time simulation and optimization). By analyzing machine learning algorithms, we identify critical properties for the value of MD analytics, Scale, Scope, and Synergy. We leverage these properties to explore market scenarios, including anonymous and secret contracting, competition among MD producers, and multiple competing aggregators. We identify significant inefficiencies and market failures, highlighting the need for nuanced policy interventions.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00674 .</content>

    <title>Limits of Disclosure Regulation in the Municipal Bond Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effectiveness of recent federal disclosure regulation aiming to improve transparency in the $4 trillion municipal bond market. Governments fail to disclose material private placements 50%–60% of the time and, conditional on disclosure, filings often omit contract details essential for bond pricing. Noncompliant issuers are significantly riskier than compliers, with disclosure decreasing in the potential of privately placed debt to adversely affect bondholders. We show that disclosure reveals positive news and is especially informative to investors in low-rated bonds or during market crises. Overall, privately placed debt continues to pose significant risks to municipal bond investors.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: T.

Some lease the add-on, whereas others sell it through intertemporal price discrimination or bundled pricing. Motivated by these practices, we examine whether a monopolistic firm should lease or sell the add-on when offering both durables. The literature suggests that leasing is preferable for a single durable good as it avoids the time inconsistency problem associated with selling. However, because leasing lacks an intertemporal link, it is less efficient than selling in balancing surplus extraction across consumers, leading to what we call the intraperiod imbalance problem. When the firm sells the base good, this can resolve the time inconsistency of add-on selling but perpetuate the intraperiod imbalance of add-on leasing. Thus, selling the add-on can be more profitable than leasing it. When the firm can choose between selling or leasing the base good, selling both the base good and the add-on can be more profitable than leasing both.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the unique institutional feature that the Israeli government bond market operates on an exchange rather than over-the-counter to analyze whether and why having an exchange affects market liquidity during a crisis. We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets, such as the Israeli government bond market, with markets lacking an exchange. Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02344 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newly released music is never assessed in isolation by audiences, who tend to compare objective (sonic attributes) and subjective (genre affiliations) elements of its identity with the previous musical catalog of the corresponding artist, his or her musically proximal peers, and the most successful releases in the market. In this paper, we provide a general framework that disentangles the objective and subjective identities of new musical releases and evaluates how differentiation affects audience reactions. We posit that radio stations, who seek commercial success, have different preferences toward differentiation in comparison with critics, who grant cultural legitimacy in the industry. Combining play numbers, reviews, and music description data from different sources, we find that radio stations prefer consistency in the musical style of successive releases by the focal artist and especially favor albums that sound similar to chart toppers. Critics, however, exhibit opposite preferences, preferring novelty compared with past works of the artist, while remaining uninfluenced by contemporaneous music dynamics. Our moderation checks reveal that decisions around genre affiliations and scheduling of new releases aid music producers to effectively manage audience expectations. This suggests that data-driven decision support systems can help artists to strategically release new products that cater to heterogeneous tastes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03319 .</content>

    <title>Auditing with a Chance of Whistleblowing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of promoting whistleblowing on audit quality and the efficiency of detecting misstatements. On the one hand, whistleblowing alerts the enforcer to the possibility of a misstatement and intensifies the regulatory effort, thereby incentivizing the auditor to improve audit quality. On the other hand, promoting whistleblowing reduces the enforcer’s investigative effort when there is no whistleblowing allegation, which in turn dampens the auditor’s incentive to enhance audit quality. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, encouraging more whistleblowing can impair audit quality and reduce detection efficiency. We also examine the socially optimal whistleblowing program, and our analysis implies that the optimal whistleblowing intensity is increasing in investment cost and the quality of the whistleblower’s information.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit within-firm variations in plant-level toxic releases to examine the effect of managerial hometown preference on corporate environmental policies. We find that pollution levels are about 30% lower for plants located near chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) hometowns. This reduction is achieved through resource-intensive pollution control efforts, including source reduction and waste management activities. Analyses using CEO turnover provide causal inferences. Local residents benefit from CEO hometown pollution reduction as localities hosting more hometown plants experience improved environmental conditions and better residential health outcomes. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that CEOs’ hometown preference is related to agency frictions. Overall, our findings reveal the impact of CEOs’ personal motivations on corporate pollution dynamics and their consequential effects on the well-being of local communities.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Q.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel 15-year data set on surgeon adoption of a complex surgical innovation in the English National Health Service and an identification strategy based on surgeon mobility, this paper disentangles three channels of coworker influence on innovation diffusion: (1) peer network size, (2) influential “key players,” and (3) cumulative peer adoption. We find that a one standard deviation in peer connections boost innovation by 16%. Key players can either amplify or dampen diffusion, and peer adoption has a greater impact on less experienced individuals. These results highlight the value of targeting training to high impact network members to speed up diffusion. This work advances our understanding of how professional networks shape innovation diffusion, with implications for technology implementation.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the European Research Council (ANR-17-EURE-0010, POEMH, Advanced Investigator Award HealthCareLabour REP-SCI-788529), the Australian Research Council (Discovery Project DP220101043) and the Health Foundation (Efficiency Research Programme).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00496 .</content>

    <title>A Preregistered Falsification Test of the Decision by Sampling Model and Rank-Order Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was funded by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation [Grant MAW 2016.0132] and the Swedish Research School of Management and IT.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03611 .</content>

    <title>Antisocial Responses to the “Coal to Gas” Regulation: An Unintended Consequence of a Residential Energy Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policies geared toward environmental and economic improvement could unexpectedly lead to negative consequences in other dimensions. Such cases raise a red flag to economists and policymakers who aim to deliver comprehensive and sensible policy evaluations. This article investigates antisocial behaviors in response to the Clean Winter Heating Policy (CWHP), which seeks to improve outdoor air quality. Our results show that participating villagers are more likely to violate laws to burn agricultural waste and exhibit lower prosociality in incentivized dictator games and public goods games. We further explore treatment heterogeneities and find that two channels are likely to play a part. First, the CWHP was perceived as a negative income shock. Therefore, the villagers would want to reduce their expenditure on straw disposal and behave less generously in the incentivized games. Second, the CWHP could trigger discontent and directly affect social preference. Additional evidence suggests that the antisocial (less prosocial) responses could have been avoided by granting larger upfront subsidies.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the demand for online freelancers using a large data set from a leading global freelancing platform. We identify the types of jobs that are more affected by generative AI and quantify the magnitude of the heterogeneous impact. Our findings indicate a 21% decrease in the number of job posts for automation-prone jobs related to writing and coding compared with jobs requiring manual-intensive skills within eight months after the introduction of ChatGPT. We show that the reduction in the number of job posts increases competition among freelancers, whereas the remaining automation-prone jobs are of greater complexity and offer higher pay. We also find that the introduction of image-generating AI technologies led to a 17% decrease in the number of job posts related to image creation. We use Google Trends to show that the more pronounced decline in the demand for freelancers within automation-prone jobs correlates with their higher public awareness of ChatGPT’s substitutability.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05420 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Gale-Shapley algorithm is one of the most popular college allocation mechanisms around the world. A crucial policy question in its setting is designing admission priorities for students, understanding how they disadvantage certain demographic groups, and whether these differences relate to differences in college performance potential. Studying a policy change in Spain, we find a negative effect of increasing the weight of standardized high-stakes exams on female college admission grades, driven by students expected to be at the top. The impact on admission grades does not affect enrollment, but the percentage of female students in the most selective degrees declines, along with their career prospects. Using data on the college performance of prereform cohorts, we find that female students most likely to lose from the reform tend to do better in college than male students expected to benefit from the reform. The results show that rewarding high-stakes performance in selection processes may come along with gender differences unrelated to the determinants of subsequent performance.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: A.

    <title>Evaluating Mortgage Renegotiation Strategies: A Data-Driven Framework for Investors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper offers a novel framework to quantify the expected gains from renegotiating delinquent loans. The framework accounts for important trade-offs between concessions to borrowers, postdelinquency loan performance, and expected collateral values. The framework’s parameters are calibrated using data on renegotiated 30-year residential fixed-rate mortgages that went delinquent during the Great Recession. Our model-implied expected gains increase during the 2007–2009 period coinciding with an increase in the rate of loan renegotiation. Counterfactual analyses show that larger expected gains can be generated from employing principal forbearance and extensions of the term to maturity compared with principal write-downs and interest-rate reductions. On the other hand, principal write-downs can be a powerful tool when borrowers are deeply underwater. Our analyses illustrate how lenders or policymakers might deploy this framework when faced with another delinquency crisis.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The author thanks the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Investors and Financial Markets at the University of Virginia for funding for this paper.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02672 .</content>

    <title>Do Institutional Investors Stabilize Equity Markets in Crisis Periods? Evidence from COVID-19</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the COVID-19 stock market crash, U.S. stocks with higher institutional ownership (IO) performed worse than those with lower IO. By studying firm-level changes, we identify two mechanisms behind this effect: a sudden downscaling of institutional capital in the equity market and a collective attempt by institutions to reposition their equity portfolios toward more COVID-resilient stocks. The stock price effects of their “portfolio downscaling” trades quickly reversed in the market’s recovery phase, whereas those of their “portfolio repositioning” trades lingered. The institutional rush for firm resilience also caused price pressures, with retail investors providing liquidity to stocks sold by institutional investors, both during the crisis and afterward. Overall, our results indicate that when a tail risk is realized, institutional investors amplify price crashes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S. Glossner and P.

    <title>Combining Ad Targeting Techniques: Evidence from a Field Experiment in the Auto Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retargeted advertising that tries to entice potential customers back to a website is widely used by advertisers and has often replaced more traditional forms of targeting, such as contextual targeting that tries to match ads to website content. However, existing research has not investigated the extent to which these different targeting techniques compete with or complement each other. To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale field experiment with an automobile manufacturer to investigate how retargeting meshes with more traditional techniques of contextual targeting online and in turn how that should affect ad content. We investigate this using three different measures of online advertising effectiveness: website visits, engagement, and soft conversions. We find that combining contextual targeting and retargeting is more effective for all three measures. However, to unleash this effectiveness, marketers have to pay attention to the ad content in their retargeted ads. We find that when combining retargeted advertising with contextual targeting, ads that prompt users to customize an offering are the most effective. Last, we provide empirical evidence for understanding the underlying mechanism associated with our findings and replicate those findings with a laboratory experiment.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02310 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective management of a firm’s operating cash flow is essential for supporting growth, servicing debt, and maintaining overall financial health. Mismanagement of cash flows can result in severe liquidity challenges and even business failure. However, managing operating cash flow is complex because of its intricate, endogenous relationships with operational variables, like sales, operating costs, inventory, payables, and the impact of exogenous macroeconomic factors on a firm. In this paper, we present a structural model of operating cash flow that untangles this endogeneity, allows us to estimate causal relationships among these variables, and provides a valuable tool for evaluating cash flow management policies. Applying our model to quarterly financial data from S&amp;P’s Compustat database spanning from 1990 to 2020 along with macroeconomic indicators, we provide empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of cash flow with other operational variables. We then showcase the practical value of our model by (i) identifying the characteristics of structural shocks and the new equilibria they induce within the system; (ii) offering a tool for evaluating alternative managerial actions or policy decisions to counteract these shocks; (iii) predicting the impacts of macroeconomic events, such as global recessions and fluctuations in economic sentiment, on firm performance; and (iv) demonstrating superior forecasting performance compared with traditional univariate models. In summary, our structural model of operating cash flow enhances our understanding of its dynamics, enabling better-informed decision making and more effective cash flow management in firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03790 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the problem of sharing the revenues raised from subscriptions to music streaming platforms among content providers. We provide direct, axiomatic, and game-theoretical foundations for two focal (and somewhat polar) methods widely used in practice: pro rata and user centric. The former rewards artists proportionally to their number of total streams. With the latter, each user’s subscription fee is proportionally divided among the artists streamed by that user. We also provide foundations for two families of methods addressing the rising concern in the music industry to explore new streaming models that better align the interests of artists, fans, and streaming services. One of the families offers a natural compromise between the pro rata and user-centric methods. The other family generalizes the user-centric method while capturing various formalizations of incentives for artists and users.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Xunta de Galicia [Grant ED431B2022/03] and MCIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and FSE+ [Grants PID2020-113440GBI00, PID2020-115011GB-I00, and PID2023-146364NB-I00].</content>

    <title>Revealed Wisdom of the Crowd: Bids Predict Loan Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the popularity of the phrase “wisdom of the crowd,” not all crowds are wise because not everyone in them acts in an informed, rational manner. Identifying informative actions, therefore, can help to isolate the truly wise part of a crowd. Motivated by this idea, we evaluate the informational value of investors’ bids using data from online, debt-based crowdfunding, in which we were able to track both investment decisions and ultimate repayment statuses for individual loans. We propose several easily scalable variables derived from the heterogeneity of investors’ bids in terms of size and timing. We first show that loans funded with larger bids relative to the typical bid amount in the market or to the bidder’s historical baseline, particularly early in the bidding period, are less likely to default. More importantly, we perform theory-driven feature engineering and find that these variables improve the predictive performance of state-of-the-art models that have been proposed in this context. Even during the fundraising process, these variables improve predictions of both funding likelihood and loan quality. We discuss the implications of these variables, including loan pricing in secondary markets, crowd wisdom in different market mechanisms, and financial inclusion. Crowdfunding platforms can easily implement these variables to improve market efficiency without compromising investor privacy.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Business Analytics Center in the Scheller College of Business and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02575 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is more competition the key to mitigating dominance by large tech platforms? Could regulation of such markets be a better alternative? We study the effects of competition and interoperability regulation in platform markets. To do so, we propose an approach of competition in net fees, which is well-suited to situations in which users pay additional charges, after joining, for on-platform interactions. Compared with existing approaches, the net fee model expands the tractable scope to allow variable total demand, platform asymmetry, and merger analysis. Regarding competition, we find that adding more platforms to the market may lead to the emergence of a dominant firm. In contrast, we find that interoperability can play a key role in reducing market dominance and lowering prices. Broadly speaking, our results favor policy interventions that assure the formidability of the competition that dominant platforms face.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that losses constrain short sellers but not the transmission of information to prices. Using unique data on U.S. equity lending, we document a negative impact of the mark-to-market losses of a stock’s short sellers, but no impact of their gains, on the future shorting of the stock. Consistent with funding and institutional constraints limiting short selling, we further show that the effect is highly asymmetric across different loss levels and stronger among stocks facing higher margin requirements. However, loss-making short selling has no impact on price efficiency or predictive power for returns, suggesting that these constraints affect mostly uninformed shorting activity.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the University of Melbourne [Faculty Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01356 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a measure of local long-run growth prospects, I uncover a novel link between economic fundamentals and house prices. Whereas excess housing returns are positively associated with economic growth prospects, housing valuations are negatively associated with shocks to growth prospects. I document an explanation in metro-area consumption: housing consumption is asymmetrically exposed to economic prospects in that it expands more quickly when prospects are strong than it contracts when prospects are poor. I explain these findings through the lens of an asset pricing model that focuses on a trade-off between nonseparable committed housing and nonhousing consumption.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: Data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01996 .</content>

    <title>Sampling-Based Approximation for Series Inventory Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study inventory management of an infinite-horizon, series system with multiple stages. Each stage orders from its immediate upstream stage, and the most upstream stage orders from an external supplier. Random demand with unknown distribution occurs at the most downstream stage. Each stage incurs inventory holding cost while the most downstream stage also incurs demand backlogging cost when it experiences inventory shortage. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over the planning horizon. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to obtain a heuristic policy (SAA policy) using the empirical distribution function constructed from a demand sample (of the underlying demand distribution). We derive an upper bound of sample size (viz., distribution-free bound) that guarantees that the performance of the SAA policy be close (i.e., with arbitrarily small relative error) to the optimal policy under known demand distribution with high probability. This result is obtained by first deriving a separable and tight cost upper bound of the whole system that depends on (given) echelon base-stock levels and then showing that the cost difference between the SAA and optimal policies can be measured by the distance between the empirical and the underlying demand distribution functions. We also provide a lower bound of sample size that matches the upper bound (in the order of relative error). Furthermore, when the demand distribution is continuous and has an increasing failure rate (IFR), we derive a tighter sample size upper bound (viz., distribution-dependent bound). Both distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the newsvendor problem, a special case of our series system, improve the previous results. In addition, we show that both bounds increase polynomially as the number of stages increases. The performance of SAA policy and the sample size bounds are illustrated numerically. Finally, we extend the results to finite-horizon series systems.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: K.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the first adaptively priced iterative combinatorial auction design, which gradually extends price expressiveness as the rounds progress. This mechanism achieves both high efficiency and fast convergence across a wide range of valuation domains. We implement our auction design using polynomial prices, show how to detect when the current price structure is insufficient to clear the market, and show how to correctly expand the polynomial structure to guarantee progress. An experimental evaluation confirms that our auction is competitive with bundle-price auctions in domains where these excel, namely multiminded valuations, but also performs well in domains favorable to linear prices, such as valuations with pairwise synergy.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4993 .</content>

    <title>Economics of Social Media Fake Accounts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid the rise of the influencer economy, fake social media accounts have become prevalent on many social media platforms. Yet the problem of fake accounts is still poorly understood, and so is the effectiveness of coping strategies. This research models the ecosystem of fake accounts in an influencer economy and obtains insights on fake account purchasing behaviors, the impact of antifake efforts, and the roles of various contextual factors. We show that as the antifake effort increases, the equilibrium may transition from a “pooling” equilibrium, where a low-quality influencer buys fake accounts to mimic a high-quality one, to a “costly separating” equilibrium, where a high-quality influencer may buy fake accounts to prevent mimicry from a low-quality influencer, and to a “naturally separating” equilibrium where low- and high-quality influencers are separated without buying fake accounts. We find that increasing antifake efforts and increasing social media literacy may sometimes result in more fake accounts. A purely profit-driven platform always prefers a pooling equilibrium with zero antifake effort. As a platform puts more weight on consumer welfare, it may exert a positive effort to induce a separating equilibrium, but the platform’s preferred antifake effort tends to be lower than that of consumers. We also find that the platform sometimes prefers a lower social media literacy and a lower fake account base price, whereas consumers prefer the opposite. In contrast, improving the antifake technology level can benefit both the platform and consumers. Our main insights are applicable to scenarios with more influencer types and repeated interactions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Retention or Acquisition? Behavior-Based Quality Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms frequently extend their brand by introducing products in new categories and offering free samples or demonstrations for customers to learn about the quality of the new products before purchasing. When introducing new products based on customers’ purchase behavior in the former category, firms face two customer segments: their own customers and the competitor’s customers. Firms can practice behavior-based pricing (BBP) by charging different prices in the two segments. Moreover, firms can practice behavior-based quality disclosure (BBD) by disclosing quality information to the two customer segments differently. In this paper, we examine how firms practice BBD in addition to BBP. We find that in contrast to the acquisition-focused BBP, firms perform retention-focused BBD by increasing quality disclosure to their own customers and decreasing it to the competitor’s customers. Unlike BBP, which decreases second-period profit and increases first-period profit, BBD increases second-period profit but decreases first-period profit when the disclosure cost is low. We also show that when firms endogenously choose BBD, the equilibrium is a prisoner’s dilemma when the disclosure cost is low and a win-win outcome when the disclosure cost is high.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72171103] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01081 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One may reasonably think that cultural homophily, defined as the tendency to associate with others of similar culture, affects collaboration in multinational teams in general but not in superstar teams of professionals at the top of their industry. The analysis of an exhaustive data set on the passes made by professional European football players in the top five men’s leagues reveals that on the contrary, cultural homophily is persistent, pervasive, and consequential, even in superstar multinational teams of very-high-skill individuals with clear common objectives and aligned incentives who are involved in interactive tasks that are well defined and not particularly culture intensive.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: G.

    <title>Managing Channel Profits with Positive Demand Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demand externalities arise when past sales stimulate future demand. They pervade many consumer markets. To penetrate such markets, how should manufacturers contract with retailers? We formulate the problem as a dynamic game, wherein the retailer can privately observe and control evolving market conditions, and consumers can act either myopically or strategically. Our contribution is threefold. (i) We characterize the optimal contract: It resolves a dynamic tradeoff between exploiting demand externalities, screening new information, and optimizing channel efficiency; moreover, it has a simple implementation of quantity discount. (ii) We characterize the dual role of demand externalities. Although demand externalities can improve channel surplus by expanding market size, they can also exacerbate information friction by enhancing the retailer’s ability to manipulate the market. Ignoring the dark side of the agency cost, previous studies may have overestimated the benefit of demand externalities. (iii) We provide new practical guidance. We show private information per se need not hurt channel efficiency: The manufacturer can use recursive advance selling to extract new information for free. Our results also shed light on when and why manufacturers should moderate demand externalities and prefer long-term contracts. By highlighting the dual role of demand externalities in long-run channel performance, this study sharpens our understanding of channel theory and practice.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: L.

    <title>To Ask or Not to Ask: The Effects of Broadly and Narrowly Adopted Peer-Recognition Systems on Help Seeking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many companies now use peer-recognition systems that allow employees to publicly recognize their peers for positive behaviors. Practitioners have touted the potential for these systems to increase helping among employees. However, the extent to which employees actually use these systems to recognize their peers varies across organizations; some are used broadly by many employees across all functional, specialty, geographic, and hierarchical subgroups of the organization, whereas others are only narrowly used by some, but not all, subgroups. Across three experiments, we examine how peer-recognition systems impact employees’ propensity to ask others for help (i.e., help seeking) based on whether the system is broadly used by all subgroups or only narrowly used by specific subgroups. We predict and find that a peer-recognition system broadly used by all subgroups strengthens employees’ perception of a help-seeking norm. This perception increases employees’ propensity to seek help directly through norm conformity and indirectly by reducing the perceived psychological costs of help seeking. We also predict and find that the effect of peer-recognition systems that are narrowly used by specific subgroups is moderated by whether employees belong to the subgroups using the system; whereas it increases help-seeking propensity for members of the subgroups using the system, it decreases help-seeking propensity for nonmembers relative to when there is no peer-recognition system. Our theory and results suggest that peer-recognition systems can increase help seeking, but these same systems could decrease help seeking for employees belonging to subgroups that do not use the system.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Supported by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00318 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a measure of the speed of firm-level information diffusion, study how it is affected by limited attention, and examine its effect on real corporate decisions. Using local flu epidemics as exogenous attention shocks, we show that inattention from dual-covering analysts and cross-holding institutions reduces the speed of information diffusion from customer to supplier stock prices. We find that the speed of information diffusion along the supply chain affects the price feedback effect for corporate investment decisions and facilitates coordination between customers and suppliers. Our findings demonstrate that coattention from key market participants affects information efficiency and generates real economic outcomes.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: L.

    <title>Secondary Market Monetization and Willingness to Share Personal Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People are often unaware that their personal data can serve as valuable inputs for economic activities in secondary data markets. However, whether secondary monetization of personal data determines privacy preferences remains unclear. I examine whether privacy decisions are motivated by the data recipient’s ability to benefit from trading individuals’ data with a third party. A large online laboratory experiment involving personally identifiable psychometric data is implemented with real data-sharing consequences and monetary benefits. I find that individuals decrease their willingness to share data—both in terms of their likelihood of participating in the data market and the prices demanded for such participation—when the recipient’s ability to monetize the data through secondary trade is salient. Strategic responses to updated beliefs about the recipient’s gain from the trade are ruled out via the chosen price elicitation. I find that increased data exposure (to more recipients) does not explain the significant revealed disutility from secondary monetization. These findings are also robust to controlling for the risk exposure differences between data recipients and third parties.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This project was funded in part by the Institute for the Social Sciences, Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03423 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collaborative customization is common in many markets. Sellers and customers can collectively discover the value of the product’s basic design. Customers’ willingness to pay can also be increased by being engaged to improve the product design. We study how a seller can design the information structure of collective learning about the product’s basic value to induce costly customer engagement. We consider a setting in which the parties’ expected payoffs are determined endogenously through the strategic interaction between seller pricing and customer engagement and purchase. The customer tends to be engaged in equilibrium, as the uncertainty on the product’s basic value becomes higher to dilute the responsiveness of the optimal price to customer engagement. Therefore, the seller seeks to maximize the probability of generating an intermediate posterior belief. Thus, the optimal information design involves either exaggerating or downplaying the product’s basic value when the prior is low or high, respectively. We show that considering restrictive information structures can generate qualitatively different implications. We also examine how the unobservability of engagement may influence the parties’ strategic interaction, their expected payoffs, and the seller-optimal information design. Interestingly, unobservability may lead to lower equilibrium engagement, hurt the seller, render the customer’s equilibrium expected payoff to increase as customer engagement becomes less important or more costly, and yield more or less information provision.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <title>Consumer Privacy in Online Retail Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploitation of consumer data allows online retailers to enhance services provided to consumers but at the risk of causing unintended privacy issues. There has been debate about whether to devise regulation policies to restrict data collection and usage by online retailers. This paper studies the implications of newly adopted privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for an online retail supply chain comprising a retailer and a supplier. We find that despite the GDPR’s intention to safeguard consumer privacy, it may inadvertently hurt consumer surplus while benefiting the retailer. In fact, the GDPR may lead to an outcome detrimental to all parties involved, including the retailer, supplier, and consumers, thereby resulting in a triple-lose situation. Our results hold significant implications for consumers, supply chain firms, and policymakers alike, contributing to the existing literature on evaluating the impact of privacy regulations on technology innovation and adoption.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01819 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How competition affects manipulation by firms of information about important attributes of their products and how such information manipulation impacts firms’ short-term and long-term performance are open empirical questions. We use a setting that is especially suitable for answering these questions—centralized crypto exchanges, on which information manipulation takes the form of inflated trading volume. We find that static and dynamic competition measures are positively associated with volume inflation, indicating that competition may lead to increased information manipulation. Exchanges that manipulate volume obtain short-run benefits but are punished in the long run, consistent with the trade-off between short-lived increases in rents and future losses because of damaged reputation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 2225/21], the Coller School of Management Blockchain Research Institute, the Henry Crown Institute for Business Research in Israel, and the Cornell Fintech Initiative for financial support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02903 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teams are formed because input from different people is needed. Providing incentives to team members, however, can be difficult. According to received wisdom, declaring all members responsible fails because real responsibility for team output “diffuses.” But why? Also, why and when does formally declaring one member “responsible” mean that this member can be attributed real responsibility? We offer a model that answers these questions. We identify when jointly declaring a team responsible results in reputation free riding. We show that declaring one person responsible can overcome this problem but only if all other team members are protected from being sanctioned.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study short-term and medium-term changes in bank risk-taking as a result of supervision and the associated real effects. For identification, we exploit the European Central Bank’s asset-quality-review (AQR) in conjunction with security and credit registers. After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit supply, with the greatest effect on riskiest securities. We find negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit availability. Moreover, nonbanks with higher exposure to reviewed banks acquire the shed risk. After the AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities but not riskier credit, resulting in negative medium-term firm-level real effects. These effects are especially strong for firms with high ex ante credit risk. Among these nonsafe firms, even those with high ex ante productivity, experience negative real effects. Our findings suggest that banks’ liquid assets help them to mask risk from supervisors and risk adjustments banks make in response to supervision have persistent corporate real effects.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: J.-L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relationship between a firm’s successful protest of a government agency’s conduct or terms of a procurement contract and the amount of business the firm conducts with the government going forward. We find firms receive fewer and less valuable government contracts, face more contract cancellations, and experience significant reductions in sales growth and employee growth. Despite widespread belief, successful bid protesters do not delay government procurement because of lengthy dispute resolutions. Overall, we provide the first analysis of corporate interactions with the United States government bid protest system.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02055 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The supply and the demand for data analytics are growing rapidly. Recent years have seen a surge in the availability of massive consumer data and in the emergence of data sellers (e.g., brokers and intermediaries). Unlike standard products, the value of data analytics for marketers depends on how their business decisions can be enabled and improved. In this paper, we investigate how a monopoly seller can offer a menu of data-based service plans to screen heterogenous marketers that can decide whether to take an action (e.g., direct selling, targeting, lending) with uncertain value and privately known cost. We characterize how, and for which marketers, the provision of information may be distorted in the optimal design. We present conditions under which optimally supplied information can be socially excessive or insufficient. It is shown that selling data appends may yield double reversals in the optimal service plans, in comparison with those when the seller’s offerings serve as marketing lists (i.e., the action is infeasible under the marketers’ outside option). We articulate how these results are coherently driven by the same underlying mechanism regarding how the marginal value of information is endogenously derived from the improvement in the marketers’ decision making over their default action. We also examine how our results can be enriched in alternative settings on the production and the costs of information.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <title>The Value of Specific Knowledge: Evidence from Disruptions to the Patient–Physician Relationship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a member of a work team leaves, some knowledge is lost to the organization. Exploiting quasi-random turnover among military physicians because of deployments, I estimate the effects of turnover on patients and other providers in the same care team. I find that a discontinuity in primary care leads to a 3%–5% increase in costs driven primarily by an increase in the use and intensity of specialty care with no observable benefit to the patient as measured by potential reductions in hospitalization rates and emergency department usage. This indicates that the full cost of turnover includes a reduction in access to knowledge among remaining members of the team.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03884 .</content>

    <title>Long Lags and Large Returns: Experimental Evidence from Advertising to Businesses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a multiyear experiment, we show that advertising to businesses can generate very different responses than has been observed for consumers. First, we estimate larger advertising returns than typically found for consumers: a return on ad spend of 12.0 (95% CI: 4.8–24.5). Second, we estimate longer lags between ad delivery and purchase: 1–5 months for first-time purchases and 5–12 months or longer for repeat purchases. Third, we find that existing business customers are responsible for most of the revenue lift from advertising, though this appears to be driven by existing business customers purchasing new parts. Additionally, our results demonstrate that geography-based switchback experiments that randomize the time between treatments can provide an effective means of estimating lagged effects. For this study we randomized the delivery of digital display ads for electronic components offered by a semiconductor manufacturer; nearly all electronic products require such components.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: M.

    <title>Market Ambiguity Attitude Restores the Risk-Return Trade-Off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A positive relation between the conditional mean and conditional volatility of aggregate stock returns, although viewed as a fundamental law of finance, has been challenging to find empirically. We consider a representative agent asset pricing model with Knightian uncertainty and demonstrate that this risk-return trade-off depends on the agent’s ambiguity attitude (reflecting the agent’s degree of optimism or pessimism). The model predicts that the conditional equity premium is increasing in market volatility, but its slope flattens as market optimism rises. We develop a methodology to extract the representative agent’s ambiguity attitude from our asset pricing model. Results validate our model predictions. We document the significant in-sample and out-of-sample explanatory power of ambiguity attitude in explaining the risk-return trade-off. In our sample, market volatility is not significant in forecasting returns. However, including the market ambiguity attitude leads to a significant positive relationship between volatility and future returns. Hence, our model and results identify market ambiguity attitude as a missing state variable that can explain why the literature has found it difficult to empirically validate the risk-return trade-off.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03595 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 4,000 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests across 600 U.S. counties from 2014 to 2021, we examine how BLM activism shapes corporate diversity at different organizational levels. We develop an approach integrating OpenAI's GPT‐4 with Chain‐of‐Thought prompting to classify race and ethnicity. In our validation tests, this method achieves higher accuracy than several tested open‐source algorithms. Our main findings are as follows. First, although firms headquartered in protest‐affected counties add more Black directors, particularly in larger protests, this gain appears to largely offset the representation of other non‐Black minority directors. Second, these board‐level shifts do not consistently extend to executives or the general workforce. In contrast, a gap may emerge between a firm's workforce composition and local labor‐market demographics, particularly in the representation of Black employees. This pattern is consistent with diversity tokenism, which suggests firms may prioritize high‐visibility board appointments and potentially downplay broader, transformative change. Our findings indicate that although board‐level diversity gains are highly visible and attract notable public attention, they may not be accompanied by an organization's transformative commitment to company‐wide diversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct the first large-scale study of how different stakeholder groups assess corporate culture and quantify the economic implications of those differences. We employ generative AI to analyze analyst reports, call transcripts, and employee reviews, and organize the extracted information into a knowledge graph that links a culture type to its perceived causes and effects. We demonstrate that the divergence in different stakeholder groups’ assessment of culture aligns with their distinct roles and economic incentives. Moreover, we show that analysts’ culture analyses are incorporated into stock recommendations and target prices, and investors react to divergence in stakeholders’ assessment of culture.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are allowed to use aggregate data on market salaries to set pay, a practice known as salary benchmarking. Using national payroll data, we study firms that gain access to a tool that reveals market benchmarks for each job title. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the benchmark information reduces salary dispersion by 25\\%. Thus, salary dispersion must stem partly from aggregate uncertainty about the salaries offered by other firms. Our model formalizes how salary dispersion can arise even in competitive labor markets for identical workers when such uncertainty exists, and we discuss implications for an ongoing policy debate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess the relationship between the racial diversity of medical providers and racial health disparities in the use of preventive care and in patient outcomes. We use unique data from the Military Health System, where we observe providers as patients so that we can identify their race, and where moves across bases change exposure to provider race in a plausibly exogenous fashion. We consider patients with four chronic, deadly, but manageable illnesses, where the relationship with the provider may have the most direct impact on health. We find striking evidence that provider racial diversity leads to reduced disparities in maintenance of preventive care and mortality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper cuPDLP.jl: A GPU Implementation of Restarted Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient for Linear Programming in Julia, by Haihao Lu and Jinwen Yang, addresses a fundamental question in large-scale optimization: Can modern GPUs be effectively leveraged for linear programming? The authors introduce cuPDLP.jl, a GPU-based solver implementing a restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method entirely in Julia. Through extensive benchmarking on standard LP test sets, including MIPLIB relaxations and Mittelmann’s benchmarks, the study demonstrates that cuPDLP.jl achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art commercial solvers such as Gurobi. Notably, the GPU implementation exhibits significant speedups on large-scale instances, highlighting the potential of first-order methods and GPU architectures for scalable optimization. The results mark a notable step toward high-performance LP solvers designed for modern hardware.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Price Caps on Advertising to Physicians: Evidence from the 340b Drug Pricing Program</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of price caps on the provision of costly effort by pharmaceutical firms using variation in drug discounts generated by a price regulation program that allows eligible hospitals to purchase outpatient drugs at steep discounts. These discounts directly affect drug manufacturers’ markups and may change firms’ incentives to exert promotional effort targeted toward physicians at these hospitals. We find that the effects of price regulation on pharmaceutical firm effort depend crucially on the design of the regulations and the multiproduct nature of pharmaceutical firms. Using detailed data on marketing payments from pharmaceutical firms to physicians, we observe that physicians receive 13% fewer promotional payments after their hospitals take up the program. The design of the price caps implies that discounts tend to increase with a drug’s age. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that pharmaceutical firms shift promotional payments away from older drugs and toward newer drugs, which are less affected by the price caps. For some drugs, this shift results in an increase in payments to physicians despite the price caps. Understanding these strategic, nonprice adjustments is important for policymakers seeking to design effective regulations targeting specific products.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by The Morrison Center for Marketing and Data Analytics and the National Science Foundation [Grant SES-1919040].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05073 .</content>

    <title>Engaging Customers with AI in Online Chats: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how artificial intelligence (AI) affected the productivity of customer service agents and customer sentiment in online interactions. Collaborating with a meal delivery company, we conducted a randomized field experiment that exploited exogenous variation in giving agents access to AI-generated suggestions. We found that AI improved both the efficiency and effectiveness of the interactions: AI-assisted agents responded faster, engaged customers more deeply, and achieved greater improvements in customer sentiment. The benefits were most pronounced for less-experienced agents. However, AI’s impact varied by conversation type: It improved efficiency and customer sentiment in subscription cancellation requests but was the least effective in repeat complaint scenarios because of systemic issues beyond the AI’s capability. A text analysis of agent messages suggests that improved customer sentiment was explained by AI-assisted agents exhibiting higher levels of key response characteristics: empathy, information, and solution. Furthermore, we exploit a unique data feature: Customers first chatted with an automated chatbot without any human intervention before they were transferred to human agents (who may or may not have had AI assistance). We found that if customers who had experienced chatbot comprehension failures were then connected to AI-assisted human agents, the involvement of AI negatively affected customer sentiment. This is because unusually rapid responses in the latter scenario led customers to believe they were still communicating with a chatbot only, suggesting a spillover from their initial negative chatbot experiences. Companies should understand the conversation contexts, such as customer intent and chatbot interactions, when integrating AI into their customer support strategies.This paper has been accepted by Catherine Tucker for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This research was supported by funding provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03920 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mandatory disclosure is a primary source of public information available to acquirers, yet little is known about how potential target managers respond to takeover threats by avoiding mandatory disclosure. This study focuses on redactions in material contracts as a setting of mandatory disclosure avoidance. We find that managers facing takeover threats are more likely to redact material contracts than other managers. To better differentiate the motives for redactions, we classify redacted contracts into nine different categories and examine managers’ redaction decisions on the three most prominently redacted types. We find managers facing takeover threats redact research and development contracts more heavily when firms possess trade secrecy, as a strategy to thwart technological acquisitions aiming at innovation combinations. By contrast, managers redact purchase and sales contracts and license and royalty contracts more heavily when they have greater private control benefits. Overall, our results highlight new tactics that managers use when they face takeover threats, especially under threats of technological acquisitions.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: L.

    <title>Cyberbullying Victimization, Mental Distress, and Adolescent Substance Use: The Role of Cyber Features</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research Spotlight: Cyberbullying, Mental Health, and Substance Use in AdolescentsCyberbullying victimization elevates adolescent substance use by intensifying mental distress. Analyzing over 500,000 survey responses, interviews, and experiments, we find that cyber features critically moderate this pathway: publicity (being observed/joined by an audience) aggravates distress, whereas separation (temporal/spatial distance) mitigates it. For policymakers, these findings underscore the need for legislation that mandates platform accountability and supports school-based mental health initiatives. Technology designers should deploy AI-driven systems to detect and deamplify harmful content while implementing built-in tools that enhance user control—such as delayed message delivery and reduced visibility features—to foster separation. Schools and parents must promote digital literacy, teach healthy coping strategies (e.g., sports, social support), and provide accessible counseling. A multistakeholder approach is essential to reduce the mental health burden of cyberbullying and prevent subsequent substance use.</content>

    <title>Why Is the Grass Always Greener on the Other Side? Tourist Bias in Online Restaurant Ratings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important assumption underlying online ratings’ helpfulness is that rating valence can serve as a good proxy for the quality of a product or service. However, consumers with different backgrounds may have different quality perceptions of the same product or service. As one of the most common types of reviews, restaurant reviews can come from two very different groups of customers: locals and tourists. Merely showing the average rating of a restaurant by pooling all ratings may not be helpful for consumers who wish to determine whether a given restaurant is a good match for them. We find that traveler consumers are much more likely than local consumers to provide higher restaurant ratings, and they tend to attach more pictures, write shorter reviews, and use fewer cognitive words. Individuals’ changes in focus and changes in evaluation processes induce such a tourist bias in ratings. Meanwhile, travel destination, restaurant cuisine authenticity, and consumers’ consumption pattern changes are not responsible for the bias. Our study demonstrates the necessity of differentiating travelers’ and locals’ ratings/reviews and identifies possible reasons behind the tourist bias, which can help retailers, consumers, and platforms better understand, utilize, and manage digital word-of-mouth in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the Tutoring Online Program (TOP), where tutoring is entirely online and tutors are volunteer university students matched with underprivileged middle school students. We leverage random assignment to estimate effects during and after the pandemic (2020 and 2022), investigating channels of impact. Three hours of individual tutoring per week increased math performance by 0.22 SD in 2020 and 0.20 SD in 2022. Higher dosage yielded stronger effects, while group tutoring smaller effects. TOP enhanced students’ aspirations, socioemotional skills, and psychological well-being, but only during school closures. We also estimate the impact of TOP on tutors, finding an increase in empathy.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a monetary quasi–experiment in Sweden from 2010–2011, when the Riksbank raised the interest rate substantially. We argue that this increase was beyond what labor market conditions warranted, driven instead by new concerns about financial stability. Using a battery of specifications that rule out domestic or international confounders, we show that this monetary tightening led to a substantial economic contraction, raising unemployment by 1–2 percentage points. Using administrative microdata, we find that sectors with nominal wage rigidity drove much of the response and that the monetary contraction was more regressive than the typical business cycle.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adverse selection benefits firms able to identify talent. An informed intermediary expropriates agents’ ability by threatening to fire and expose them to undervaluation of their skill. An agent’s track record gradually reduces intermediary’s information advantage. In response, the intermediary starts churning well-performing agents she knows are less skilled. The accelerated reduction in information advantage boosts profits, as retained agents accept below-reservation wages to build reputation faster. Agents prefer starting their careers working for an intermediary, as benefits from building reputation faster more than offset expropriation costs. Our analysis applies to professions where talent is essential and performance is publicly observable. (JEL D21, D82, J23, J24, J31, J63, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a linear GMM estimator of the discrete-time mixed proportional hazard (MPH) model of duration with an arbitrary distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. We allow for competing risks, observable characteristics, and censoring. We prove our estimator is consistent and apply it to the duration of price spells. We find substantial unobserved heterogeneity with economically meaningful implications for the response of output to a monetary policy shock in a model with time-dependent pricing rules and for the degree of state dependence in a model of price plans.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Did credit drive the 2000s housing cycle? The existing literature’s findings range from credit having no effect to credit explaining most of the cycle. We show that these disparate results hinge on the extent to which landlords absorb credit-driven demand, which depends on the degree of housing market segmentation. We develop a model that nests cases between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically considered, estimate an elasticity that pins down the degree of segmentation, and use it to calibrate our model. We find credit standards played an important role, explaining 32 percent to 53 percent of the boom. (JEL E32, E44, G51, R21, R31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;International migrants may facilitate the transmission of ideas across countries. We examine the impact of migrant exposure to reproductive health policies on origin-country fertility in the Philippines. We exploit temporal variation in destination-country reproductive health policies combined with spatial variation across Philippine provinces in their migration intensity and historical composition of migrant destinations. Migrant exposure to more liberalized reproductive health policies reduces origin-community fertility. This reduction is driven by increased adoption of modern contraceptives. Visible policy changes, such as commercial advertising of contraceptives, lead to this change in behavior. Firmly established family planning values moderate the fertility response.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal income taxation in a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous locational preferences, labor supply decisions, and competitive housing and labor markets. Expressions characterizing the optimal tax schedule in each community are provided that capture the fiscal externalities associated with migration and the effects of redistribution between households and landlords. Correlation between skill and locational preferences yields optimal transfers to poor areas, while sorting based on comparative advantage can motivate transfers in either direction. A calibration to areas targeted by the US Empowerment Zone program yields sizable optimal spatial transfers that are sensitive to assumed levels of migration responsiveness.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy-relevant treatment effect estimation in a marketplace setting requires assessing both the direct treatment benefit and spillovers induced by changes to the market equilibrium. We show how to identify and estimate policy-relevant treatment effects using a unit-randomized trial run within a single large market. A Bernoulli-randomized trial allows consistent estimation of direct effects and of treatment-heterogeneity measures that enable welfare-improving targeting. Estimating spillovers—and providing confidence intervals for the direct effect—requires estimates of price elasticities, which we provide using an augmented experimental design. We illustrate our results using a simulation calibrated to a conditional cash-transfer experiment in the Philippines. (JEL C21, C51, I32, I38, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Software is one of the most important assets that needs to be priced in the digital economy. It has emerged as a disruptive technology, with companies primarily valued for their software offerings growing from 2 percent to 13 percent of market share between 1996 and 2023. We document persistent anomalies in growth forecasts and stock returns for software companies, indicating significant deviations from rational expectations over multiple decades. Our findings are consistent with Bayesian investors gradually learning about software’s growing importance, highlighting how markets can be very slow to discern fundamental shifts from transient shocks in noisy data.

We first show that business owners are considerably more likely to employ copartisan workers. This phenomenon is in part driven by the overlapping of political and social networks. Multiple tests—surveys, event studies, analyses of wage premia and promotions within the firm, and a field experiment—further highlight how business owners’ political preferences directly influence firms’ employment decisions. A channel of political discrimination appears more relevant than one of political quid pro quo between firms and politicians. (JEL C93, D22, D72, J23, M51, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how passive investing affects asset prices. Flows into passive funds disproportionately raise the stock prices of the economy’s largest firms, especially those large firms in high demand by noise traders. Because of this effect, the aggregate market can rise even when flows are entirely due to investors switching from active to passive funds. Intuitively, passive flows increase the idiosyncratic risk of large firms in high demand, which discourages investors from correcting the flows’ effects on prices. Consistent with our theory, prices and idiosyncratic volatilities of the largest S&amp;P500 firms rise the most following flows into that index. (JEL G12, G23, E44)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;U sing lenders who become members of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as an exogenous shock, we examine whether and how lenders’ commitment to transparent climate-related disclosures affects borrowers’ environmental performance. We find that borrowers of TCFD-member lenders, relative to control firms, significantly improve their environmental performance after the TCFD launch. Lenders’ disclosure commitments influence borrowers through credit rationing and monitoring. Specifically, polluting borrowers face higher borrowing costs, reduced access to credit, and greater incorporation of environmental action covenants in loan agreements. Additionally, polluting borrowers of TCFD-member lenders experience heightened financial constraints. Finally, borrowers of TCFD-member lenders are more likely to adopt the TCFD framework for climate-related disclosure after the TCFD establishment. Together, these findings illuminate the role of lenders in driving corporate environmental performance improvement through their commitment to transparent climate-related disclosures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct the first annual market rent and home sales price series for American cities over the 20th century using 2.7 million newspaper real estate listings. Our findings revise several stylized facts about U.S. housing markets. Real market rents did not fall during the postwar period in most cities and rose nationally by 60% from 1890 to 2006. We also document higher sales price growth between 1953 and 1987 relative to previous series. Real prices reached almost 4 times their 1890 level by 2006. Prices grew most in metros with high demand and low levels of construction. We find that the rent-to-price ratio fell from about 8% in the early 20th century to 3% by 2006, consistent with declines in the cost of owning housing relative to renting. For the typical year in our period, the annual return to owning housing was 9%, driven mostly by rental returns of 7.7%, with capital gains contributing only 1.3%. While capital gains were close to zero from 1890 to 1940, they grew to nearly a third of total returns from 1970 to 2006.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Boosting Profits of Trade-in Programs Through Smarter PricingAs electronics trade-in programs expand worldwide, firms face complex pricing challenges: quoting offers instantly while managing vast product varieties and uncertain demand. In the article “Dynamic pricing for a multiproduct consumer electronics trade-in program” in Operations Research, the authors address this challenge and present effective solutions. The study develops pricing policies that determine both trade-in offers and resale prices over time to maximize profits. It first introduces a static pricing approach and proves that it performs nearly optimally; then, it further proposes a dynamic “batched-adjustment” policy that adapts to demand uncertainty and delivers an improved profit performance. Numerical experiments confirm the advantages of these methods. By demonstrating simple yet powerful strategies with provable effectiveness, the research offers firms actionable tools to increase profitability in trade-in operations.</content>

    <title>Correlation Improves Group Testing: Modeling Concentration-Dependent Test Errors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Population-wide screening is a powerful tool for controlling infectious diseases. Group testing can enable such screening despite limited resources. Viral concentration of pooled samples are often positively correlated, either because prevalence and sample collection are influenced by location, or through intentional enhancement via pooling samples according to risk or household. Such correlation is known to improve efficiency when test sensitivity is fixed. However, in reality, a test’s sensitivity depends on the concentration of the analyte (e.g., viral RNA), as in the so-called dilution effect, where sensitivity decreases for larger pools. We show that concentration-dependent test error alters correlation’s effect under the most widely used group testing procedure, the two-stage Dorfman procedure. We prove that when test sensitivity increases with concentration: pooling correlated samples together (correlated pooling) achieves asymptotically higher sensitivity than independently pooling the samples (naive pooling). In contrast, in the concentration-independent case, correlation does not affect sensitivity. Moreover, with concentration-dependent errors, correlation can degrade test efficiency compared with naive pooling, whereas under concentration-independent errors, correlation always improves efficiency. We propose an alternative measure of test resource usage, the number of positives found per test consumed, which we argue is better aligned with infection control, and show that correlated pooling outperforms naive pooling on this measure. In simulation, we show that the effect of correlation under realistic concentration-dependent test error is meaningfully different from correlation’s effect assuming fixed sensitivity. Our findings underscore the importance for policy makers of using models that incorporate naturally occurring correlation and of considering ways of strengthening this correlation.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Provost’s Office of Cornell University, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [Grant FA9550-19-1-0283], and the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences [Grant DMS2230023].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04217 .</content>

    <title>No Gifts Returned: Surprise Bonuses Reduce Productivity in a Natural Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gift exchange hypothesis posits that workers reciprocate above-market wages with increased productivity. This paper tests this hypothesis in a natural field experiment where one or both workers in a pair received a discretionary bonus after an initial round of data entry tasks. Bonuses were assigned based on one of three criteria: (i) relative productivity in the initial round, (ii) economic need, or (iii) an arbitrary decision. Two conditions where neither or both workers received a bonus served as the baseline. Contrary to the gift exchange hypothesis, we found a significant decline in postbonus productivity, especially when both workers received the bonus. This result suggests that workers interpreted the bonus as a signal of employer contentment, allowing them to reduce their effort. We conjectured that the postbonus productivity decline may result from either (a) a lower perceived risk of repercussions from slacking, such as early dismissal, or (b) a reduced sense of obligation to reciprocate the employer’s kindness. A follow-up experiment replicated the primary result, providing moderate evidence for the explanation based on reduced fear of dismissal. The main effect of bonuses on productivity was substantial, with effort reductions of 15.1% in the first experiment and 8.4% in the follow-up relative to baseline. In cases where only one worker received a bonus, nonrecipients’ inequality aversion appeared to decrease productivity markedly in the economic need treatment, whereas status-seeking behavior slightly increased productivity by bonus recipients in the productivity treatment.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a parsimonious set of factors from a large pool of candidates for explaining hedge fund returns, ranging from equity market, anomaly, and trend-following factors to macroeconomic factors. The resulting 9-factor model, including five anomaly factors, outperforms existing hedge fund models both in sample and out of sample, with a significant reduction in alphas while showing substantial cross sectional performance heterogeneity. Further analysis based on fund holdings confirms the model’s ability to capture returns from arbitrage trading. Overall, the anomaly factors help quantify hedge fund strategies and risk exposures and improve fund performance evaluation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the factor structure in delta-hedged equity option returns. A sparse latent factor model generates a correlation of 0.90 or higher between average and predicted option returns. A comparable performance is achieved with a characteristic-based model containing four factors: the equally weighted option portfolio, a factor based on the difference between historical and implied volatilities, a factor based on the ratio of corporate cash holdings to the total value of the firm’s assets, and a factor based on volatility of volatility. Traditional stock return factors cannot explain these option factors.</content>

    <title>Non‐Market Strategy and Deglobalization: Firm–State Relations and the Historical Microfoundations of Corporate Political Activity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines deglobalization through the lens of non‐market strategy (NMS), focusing on the antecedents and microfoundations of corporate political activity (CPA) in the global aluminium industry. Drawing on archival research and historical analysis, we challenge the prevailing view of deglobalization as a state‐driven reversal of globalization. Instead, we reconceptualize it as a co‐evolving process of firm–state relations, where multinational enterprises (MNEs) and governments jointly construct institutional arrangements. Our analysis demonstrates how MNEs leverage ideological alignments, elite networks, and long‐term political capabilities to influence protectionist policies, trade governance, and national development agendas. We identify the microfoundations of CPA – ideological affinity, embedded agency, and networked trust – as critical to shaping institutional and policy outcomes with macroeconomic and geopolitical consequences. By tracing firm–state interactions across a century of global change, we demonstrate how CPA functions as a historically constituted practice through which firms exercise both ideological and political agency. In reframing deglobalization as not merely an external constraint but a strategic outcome co‐produced by business and state actors, this study extends non‐market strategy theory. We highlight how deglobalization and globalization are not sequential opposites but intertwined processes, co‐constructed through the persistent deployment of NMS and CPA.</content>

    <title>Design-Mediated Morality: The Transformative Potential of Aesthetic Objects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Art and artisanal objects carry the potential for moral transformations. Although consumer research suggests a relationship between aesthetic taste and morality, scholars have not deeply considered the role of material design in shaping consumers’ moral self. We address this missing link by theorizing the formative process of design-mediated morality: defined as the transmission of moral values into design objects through manifestos and design scripts, which allow consumers to experience morality in direct material engagements. We draw on a longitudinal ethnography of the New Nordic Food movement and its iconic flagship restaurant, noma, to demonstrate the influence of manifestos in streamlining moral virtues with aesthetic expressions. We identify three distinct scripting strategies (simulation, estrangement and sensitization) that steer consumers’ sensory and affective engagement with design objects. Our findings also explain that consumers’ moral awakening is tied to direct material engagement (or 'thinging’) with said objects. By highlighting the embodied dimensions of moralization, our work connects and advances research streams on market-mediated moralization, taste formation and experiential marketing. We conclude with critical reflections on the role of artisanal movements and design in affecting moral transformations, as well as outline avenues for future research on design-mediated morality in everyday consumption contexts.</content>

    <title>Don't calm down! How affective climate emerges in start‐ups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Different types of affective climates—norms related to the experience, expression, use, and regulation of emotions—have been shown to impact organizational outcomes. However, we know less about how these climates emerge. This study investigates the emergence of affective climates through a 22‐month longitudinal multiple‐case study of five early‐stage start‐ups. Our analysis revealed that an affective climate of high authenticity emerged in start‐ups through three key mechanisms: the interaction between positive and negative emotions, constructive meta‐emotions, and interpersonal emotion regulation characterized by emotional validation and problem‐solving. Our findings contribute to the understanding of affective climate emergence and offer nuanced insights into how founders, managers, and teams can cultivate constructive emotional dynamics in highly uncertain, fast‐paced environments.Managerial SummaryWe explore how affective climate emerges through a longitudinal case study of five start‐ups. Affective climate describes norms and assumptions concerning the experience, expression, use, and regulation of emotions. Research suggests that an affective climate of high authenticity—meaning that members feel free to express their actual emotions—contributes to creativity and performance while reducing burnout. However, prior research offers few insights into how and why different affective climates emerge in start‐ups. We find that managers and founders may shape their organization's affective climate toward high authenticity by fostering positive emotions, through an accepting attitude toward their own negative emotions, and by validating employees' emotions. By doing so, managers and founders can foster healthy emotional dynamics in their start‐ups.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the increased use of data technologies, like machine learning, by financial intermediaries affect the allocation of capital towards innovation? I study this question in the context of startup financing by venture capitalists (VCs). While VCs adopting data technologies become better at screening startups similar to those in historical data, they tilt their investments towards this pool and become concurrently less likely to finance innovative startups that achieve rare major success. Plausibly exogenous variations in VCs’ screening automation suggest that these effects are causal. These findings highlight how investors’ adoption of data technologies can have real effects through innovation financing. (JEL G24, L26, O30)</content>

    <title>Teams in Crisis: The Effect of Team Familiarity on Performance Under Conditions of Crisis and Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on fluid teams has consistently found a positive relationship between team familiarity and performance, but little empirical research has investigated whether these benefits of familiarity extend to times of crisis and uncertainty. This study examines how team familiarity influences provider decision times in the emergency department, focusing on how its effects vary across different crisis and uncertainty contexts. Using patient and provider assignment data from a large, multisite emergency department, we construct care team familiarity networks and analyze familiarity’s impact on decision-making speed during both low-uncertainty crises (high-acuity patient surges) and high-uncertainty crises (early COVID-19 pandemic), as well as under conditions of patient-level task uncertainty. We find that team familiarity consistently reduces provider decision times; familiarity is particularly beneficial during crises. However, across both crisis and noncrisis situations, we find that the positive effects of familiarity are significantly weakened under conditions of high uncertainty. These findings underscore the conditional nature of familiarity’s benefits, suggesting that in highly uncertain or novel situations, teams cannot rely solely on past shared experience to maintain performance. Implications for staffing strategies in healthcare and other high-stakes environments highlight the need for organizations to balance the benefits of familiarity with adaptability in the face of uncertainty.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2025.20912 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present an experimental study of investors’ willingness to pay for socially responsible assets. In our initial public offering experiment, various assets share identical financial risk-return profiles but differ in the intensity and timing of societal benefits, represented by charitable donations. We find that subjects value societal benefits positively and prefer a positive correlation between financial returns and these societal benefits. We offer implications for the design of corporate social responsibility policies and for the pricing of responsible assets.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Chair on Sustainable Finance at Toulouse School of Economics.

    <title>Motivator or Depletor? Unraveling the Double‐Edged Effects of Peer Monitoring on Employee Job Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer monitoring, as a type of organizational control, is increasingly important in managing employee performance. However, extant research primarily focuses on the benefits of peer monitoring on job performance, while largely ignoring its potential negative consequences. We advance the literature to theorize and test the double‐edged effects of peer monitoring on job performance by examining its self‐regulatory consequences. Specifically, we propose that peer monitoring can simultaneously increase both work engagement and ego depletion, which in turn exert positive and negative impacts on job performance, respectively. Furthermore, we theorize that trait self‐control is a critical contingent factor that moderates both the positive and negative pathways from peer monitoring to job performance. We test our model through a two‐wave, multisource field survey study involving 203 employees and their 49 direct supervisors in China, as well as through an experimental study with 149 full‐time working employees in the United States. We find consistent evidence for the negative consequences of peer monitoring on job performance via ego depletion, while the positive pathway through work engagement is only supported by the field survey study. Furthermore, both studies show that there is a positive indirect effect of peer monitoring on job performance via work engagement when employees have lower trait self‐control and a negative indirect effect via ego depletion when employees have higher trait self‐control. Such examination helps elucidate the positive and negative effects of peer monitoring on job performance and has important theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that socially responsible investors can have a negative impact by slowing the pace of firm reform. Investors with broad prosocial preferences value acquiring dirty firms with high negative production externalities because they can reform these firms. The anticipation of trading gains for dirty firms decreases the incentive of current firm owners to reduce externalities proactively, potentially causing delay in reform. The presence of financial investors—alongside socially responsible investors—can exacerbate delay. Investment mandates through which socially responsible investors commit to paying a premium for green firms can incentivize reform in a timely manner. (JEL G11, G23, G24, G34, H41, M14)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Auction models are convenient abstractions of informal price-formation processes that arise in markets for assets or services. These processes involve frictions like bidder recruitment costs for sellers, participation costs for bidders, and limitations on sellers’ commitment abilities. This paper develops an auction model that captures such frictions. We derive novel insights, notably that outcomes are often inefficient, that markets sometimes unravel, and that the observability of competition may have a large effect.</content>

    <title>Scandal, Associative Stigma, and Sorting in Labor Markets: Archival and Experimental Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stigma stemming from managerial scandals often spreads beyond the implicated transgressor and contaminates other actors via stigma by association. We study how associative stigma resulting from scandals involving managerial misconduct affects subordinate worker careers. We extend prior work by distinguishing between managerial misconduct in the professional domain from managerial misconduct in the personal domain and theorize that this distinction will affect the severity of associative stigma, audience evaluations, and associated workers’ labor market outcomes. Our multimethod empirical approach combines archival analysis of administrative employment records with a series of preregistered, randomized vignette experiments. Our archival analysis demonstrates that workers associated with managers who engage in misconduct sort into organizations with a history of managerial misconduct. The magnitude of this effect is amplified when associative stigma arises from managerial misconduct in the personal domain, a pattern driven by the fact that associative stigma arising from managerial misconduct in the professional domain tends to carry a relatively stronger labor market penalty and increased likelihood of worker exit from the industry. Our experimental studies, which measure employment intentions of workers and hiring intentions of employers, suggest that the psychological mechanism of stigma apprehension plays a role in facilitating the sorting that we observe, a result consistent with the interpretation that sorting emerges from greater tolerance of actors stigmatized by association rather than a taste for misconduct and thus, affirmative assortative matching. These findings contribute to the stigma literature by showing how stigma by association effects vary across audiences and linking this variation to sorting outcomes.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funded: The authors thank the Blake Family Fund for Ethics, Leadership, and Governance at Purdue University for supporting this research.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00075 .</content>

    <title>Textual Factors: A Scalable, Interpretable, and Data-Driven Approach to Analyzing Unstructured Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a general approach for analyzing large-scale text-based data, combining the strengths of neural network language processing and generative statistical modeling to create a factor structure of unstructured data for downstream regressions typically used in social sciences. We generate textual factors by (i) representing texts using vector word embedding, (ii) clustering the vectors using locality-sensitive hashing to generate supports of topics, and (iii) identifying relatively interpretable spanning clusters (i.e., textual factors) through topic modeling. Our data-driven approach captures complex linguistic structures while ensuring computational scalability and economic interpretability, plausibly attaining certain advantages over and complementing other unstructured data analytics used by researchers, including emergent large language models. We conduct initial validation tests of the framework and discuss three types of its applications: (i) enhancing prediction and inference with texts, (ii) interpreting (non–text-based) models, and (iii) constructing new text-based metrics and explanatory variables. We illustrate each of these applications using examples in finance and economics such as macroeconomic forecasting from news articles, interpreting multifactor asset pricing models from corporate filings, and measuring theme-based technology breakthroughs from patents.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study employee mental health to assess the long-term nonmonetary consequences of mergers. Using employer-employee level data linked to individual health records, we document that the incidences of stress, anxiety, depression, and psychiatric medication usage increase following mergers. These effects are prevalent among employees from both targets and acquirers, in weak and in growing profitable firms. Employees who experience negative career developments within the merging firms, ‘blue-collar’ workers, and employees with lower skills are most affected. Mergers that generate more mental illness among employees perform worse after the transaction. A variety of tests address endogeneity concerns.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: Funding from the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (Misum) and the Nasdaq Nordic Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04277 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study supply‐and‐demand effects in the U.S. Treasury bill market by comparing the returns on T‐bills to the policy rate on the Federal Reserve's reverse repurchase (RRP) facility. We develop and test a simple model where the RRP‐bill spread is policed both by heterogeneously elastic money funds and by corporate treasurers who derive collateral benefits from holding T‐bills. In response to shifts in T‐bill supply, money funds act as front‐line arbitrageurs. However, when T‐bills become extremely scarce, less elastic corporate treasurers become the marginal investors and supply shifts have a larger effect on T‐bill rates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances the understanding of innovation across generations in family businesses by revealing how imprinting and self-determination shape innovation trajectories following succession. Through a case study of 16 Dutch family Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry, we identified four innovation trajectories—Inherited, Ancillary, Synergistic, and Detached Innovation. We disentangle the effect of structural imprinting and behavioral imprinting on the successor and examine how successor self-determination mediates imprinting forces. We rebalance the emphasis on incumbent-centric family business studies and explain the heterogeneity of post-succession innovation outcomes. These insights offer new theoretical tools for understanding and managing innovation during critical transition periods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some research has suggested that investors prefer pitches made by men rather than women entrepreneurs, and physically attractive men entrepreneurs are even more successful than their physically unattractive counterparts. However, empirical evidence remains limited. We re-examine these findings using a large archival dataset with 9,285 entrepreneurs across 13 industries and 105 countries between the years of 2014 to 2018. Our results replicate the female penalty effect—women raised 12.9% less funds compared to men. However, we found that the physical attractiveness of the entrepreneurs has a negative main effect on startups’ success, and that this effect is only significant for men entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study intermediation in the housing market. Using data from an online platform utilized by real estate agents to generate leads, we identify exogenous intermediary attention arising from the quasi-randomized ordering of potential listings. Greater intermediary attention leads to an increased probability of listing with an agent and selling quickly, and a higher transaction price. The listing and transaction probabilities of neighboring properties decrease in intermediary attention. These results contrast sharply with endogenous correlations and provide causal evidence that intermediaries resolve property-level frictions deriving from search, information, or behavioral considerations but do not mitigate neighborhood-level information asymmetries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Developing countries face massive urbanization and slum upgrading is a popular policy to improve shelter for many. Yet, preserving slums at the expense of formal developments can raise concerns of misallocation of land. We estimate causal, long-term impacts of the 1969-1984 KIP program, which provided basic upgrades to 5 million residents covering 25% of land in Jakarta, Indonesia. We assemble high-resolution data on program boundaries and 2015 outcomes and address program selection bias through localized comparisons. On average, KIP areas today have lower land values, shorter buildings, and are more informal, per a photographs-based slum index. The negative effects are concentrated within 5km of the CBD. We develop a spatial equilibrium model to characterize the welfare implications of KIP. Counterfactuals suggest that 79% of the welfare effects stem from removing KIP in the center and highlight how to mitigate losses to displaced residents.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Competitive Collection in Closed-Loop Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recycling and remanufacturing have gained significance and popularity in response to growing environmental concerns and economic pressures. Although previous studies have extensively examined the competitive collection in a closed-loop supply chain, they ignored the pricing decisions in both the forward and reverse channels. In this paper, we develop a two-period analytical framework that considers pricing decisions in both the forward and reverse channels to explore the impacts of competitive collection on optimal prices and profits within a closed-loop supply chain. This study focuses on three distinct used-product collection models: (1) the manufacturer collects used products directly from consumers; (2) the manufacturer outsources the collection activity to a third-party collector (TPC); and (3) the manufacturer and TPC engage in a competitive collection. Our analysis uncovers several intriguing insights. First, competitive collection does not necessarily increase the collecting price for consumers as the TPC prefers to increase its collecting price while the manufacturer prefers to reduce its collecting price. Second, the TPC’s increased collecting price does not force the manufacturer to increase his transfer price for the TPC. Third, competitive collection will benefit those consumers who buy the remanufactured product as the price of this product decreases. Fourth, the manufacturer and retailer may be better off directly or through revenue-sharing mechanisms in competitive collection. In addition, the competitive collection could also achieve a win–win situation in terms of financial performance and environmental sustainability. Lastly, when the competitive collection is between the manufacturer and retailer, the manufacturer benefits from the competition but the retailer does not. This paper also discusses the intuition behind these findings and their managerial implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Forced displacement crises have become a pressing humanitarian concern. Refugee movements expose individuals to dire living conditions with severe inaccessibility to essential resources. Humanitarian organizations play a vital role in alleviating these hardships through relief aid interventions. This study aims to optimize the fulfillment of recurring needs for geographically dispersed refugee groups en route to safe destinations. Here, capacitated mobile facilities are tasked with delivering relief aid to refugee groups periodically to ensure equitable service frequency. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process with multinomial state-transition distributions, shaped by external migration pull factors such as safety conditions, road accessibility, and spatial proximity. The objective is to minimize the relocation and replenishment costs of mobile facilities, along with the deprivation costs faced by underserved refugees. We develop an approximate dynamic programming algorithm featuring a novel policy replication routine. To complement this offline method, we introduce a state-dependent variable threshold policy that enables high-quality, real-time relief provision. Using instances inspired by the Syrian refugee crisis, our results demonstrate the substantial value of stochastic modeling, yielding a 25% reduction in expected total costs compared to deterministic baselines and up to 12% savings through coordinated planning among humanitarian actors. The proposed methods remain effective under dispersed and cohesive refugee group dynamics and multi-destination migration scenarios. Furthermore, we uncover high-frequency traversal and service hotspots along migration paths to provide tactical insights for parameter calibration and resource prepositioning. Collectively, our findings offer practical insights for managing ongoing and future refugee migration crises.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Refining Data-driven Upfront Reservation Discount Pricing via Inverse Inferring Newsvendor Transactions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the supplier’s pricing problem under upfront reservation discount (URD) contracts where the buyer reserves products in advance and then adjusts the purchase quantity based on realized end-market demand. A key challenge is that the supplier typically has limited data to estimate the demand distribution and possesses inferior information compared to the buyer. To address the challenges of distributional ambiguity and information asymmetry, we develop a Refined Distributionally Robust Optimization (RDRO) model for the supplier’s URD pricing to maximize her worst-case profit. To better infer true demand patterns, beyond the conventional reliance on historical demand data, our approach leverages past transaction records involving supplier-buyer interactions through the inverse optimization underlying the first-order conditions of the buyer’s newsvendor behavior. Then, a general Wassersteinp-distance minimization problem forp≥1 is developed to generate a Refined Empirical Distribution (RED) in the enhanced set. We prove that the RED provides a superior estimation of the true demand distribution compared to the classical empirical distribution when the buyer holds an informational advantage. Although identifying the RED leads to an intractable semi-infinite program, we show that the RED admits a closed-form solution. To obtain the supplier’s worst-case profit involving a non-convex distributionally optimistic optimization problem with a decision-dependent uncertainty set, we exploit the monotone transport structure between univariate distributions to truncate the distributions and convert the decision-dependent quantile constraints, which results in a finite-dimensional convex model that can be efficiently solved. Moreover, we extend the model to accommodate data noise, volatile market prices, evolving market conditions, and multi-item settings. Numerical experiments based on a virtual machine reservation problem in the cloud service market demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crises are accompanied by resource shortages, operational challenges, and shifts in demand for resources. During crises, non-profit organizations have historically played a crucial role in mitigating these challenges, with crowdfunding platforms emerging as a new solution for resource mobilization. In this study, we examine how individual and institutional donors respond to the sudden shifts in demand that accompany a global crisis. We analyze rich, granular data from multiple sources, including donation data from a leading education crowdfunding platform, before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and find notable contrasts between individual and institutional responses. While there was a significant increase in institutional donations during the pandemic, individual donations remained relatively stable overall. Adopting a motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, we center donor heterogeneity in our approach, deriving nuanced insights. Donations from individuals in economically disadvantaged communities, which were the worst impacted by the crisis, decreased; however, these communities prioritized immediate and time-sensitive needs. Small and local institutions played a pivotal role in supporting high-need schools during the crisis. These findings make meaningful contributions to the operations literature on crowdfunding and have practical implications for platform designers. By distinguishing between individual and institutional donors and identifying the factors that drive their behavior, our study offers important implications for platform designers to improve crisis-time resource mobilization through more targeted engagement strategies.</content>

    <title>Good Lessons Despite Bad Feelings: How Boundary-Spanning Teams Learn from Collaboration Failure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To stay competitive, organizations set up boundary-spanning teams (BSTs) to learn from external partners. However, collaborating across boundaries is challenging and BSTs often face collaboration failure, defined as divergence from desired or expected collaboration goals. Given the costs associated with such failures, they usually evoke negative emotions which often lead to blaming the external partner and a collaboration breakdown, undermining joint learning from failure. This raises the question of how BSTs can learn from collaboration failure despite negative emotions. Our inductive study on drug discovery teams provides a silver lining: certain emotive-cognitive conditions can give rise to learning interactions that allow BSTs to either neutralize or transform their negative emotions into positive ones. Averting collaboration breakdown, these interactions allow BSTs to both create and integrate explicit knowledge after collaboration failure and change their collaboration dynamics in order to prevent failure in the future and improve their way of collaborating. Our study brings forward an emotive perspective on learning from collaboration failure and expands the literature on BSTs and emotions in groups. It further informs management practices on how to overcome negative emotions and beliefs so that BSTs sustain fruitful collaborations, enabling critical innovations such as treatments for diseases to be further developed.</content>

    <title>Culture as a Toolkit for Robust Action: Tackling Grand Challenges with Cultural Entrepreneurship</title>
    <updated>2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Logan Crace</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A new grand challenges paradigm has emerged in organization theory that has reoriented scholarly attention toward how society can effectively tackle a broad array of complex, uncertain, and evaluative matters of concern including climate change, forcible displacement, poverty, authoritarianism, child malnutrition, commercial sex exploitation, and many more. In this paper, I argue that the literature has tended toward a view of culture as a constraining force that inhibits tackling grand challenges and renders them remarkably intractable. Yet, alternative views of culture also purport that it can serve not merely as a constraining force that prevents action but also as a toolkit or repertoire of resources that actors use to solve problems and thus an enabling force for progress. The substantial literature on cultural entrepreneurship provides several powerful theoretical affordances that are uniquely useful in overcoming known obstacles to addressing grand challenges. I draw on the intellectual resources of this literature to augment the robust action model—one of the premiere theoretical frameworks for tackling grand challenges—by expanding each of the three robust action strategies through an integration with cultural entrepreneurship. This theoretical elaboration advances our understanding of the early moments of initiation of robust action strategies when they are merely uncertain future possibilities, as well as the culturally informed ensuing dynamics by which robust action continues in perpetuity. I conclude by discussing a new generative dialogue at the interstice of these two domains which has substantial synergies for future scholarship.</content>

    <title>Unsettling Settled Knowing: Reconciling Differences in Expert Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Occupational subgroups with similar training often develop differing work practices within their local settings. These differences may create inconsistencies when organizational change brings subgroups together to work alongside each other. Based on a two-year qualitative study of a hospital merger combining two neonatal intensive care units, we consider how differing expert practices may be challenged, preserved, or reconciled when subgroups are brought together. We find that reconciliation processes are unexpectedly triggered by novice newcomers who struggle to socialize into a consistent way of working. Comparing five expert practices over time, we also find that when groups are able to converge around the type of knowledge that should apply to expert practices (abstract versus experiential knowledge), a form of reconciliation is possible, but when there is divergence around the type of knowledge that is relevant to the situation, reconciliation fails. Converging on experiential knowledge implies a simplified process of reconciliation that preserves expert autonomy while masking residual differences. Converging on abstract knowledge involves a complex, multilayered process in which expert subgroups need to revert in part to mechanisms resembling those that underpinned their initial socialization into the discipline. These mechanisms include mobilizing evidence to update abstract knowledge, situated mentoring with respected experts, and authoritative reinforcing via interventions from high-status professionals. Our study highlights the challenges of changing expert practices that are rooted in ingrained experiential knowledge. It reveals that abstract knowledge alone is insufficient and that reconciliation invariably involves settlements and agreements on what form of knowledge matters.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entropy-Regularized Wasserstein Distributionally Robust OptimizationUncertainty in data poses a central challenge in operations research. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) offers a principled framework for addressing this challenge by producing solutions resilient to distributional variations. Among various DRO approaches, the Wasserstein DRO has received significant attention though its computational efficiency relies on stringent assumptions, and its worst case distributions are typically discrete. In “Sinkhorn Distributionally Robust Optimization,” Wang, Gao, and Xie leverage the Sinkhorn distance—an entropy-regularized variant of the Wasserstein distance—to more realistically model uncertainty, enhancing computational efficiency. The authors establish a strong duality reformulation and propose a first order stochastic mirror descent algorithm with provable complexity guarantees for general loss functions. Unlike Wasserstein DRO, Sinkhorn DRO yields continuous worst case distributions, offering a more flexible representation of practical uncertainties. Extensive experiments in the newsvendor problem, portfolio optimization, and adversarial classification demonstrate its superior performance in both out-of-sample performance and efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pricing and Resource Allocation Made Simple for Service SystemsLarge-scale service systems—from drone delivery to cloud computing—face the dual challenge of balancing customer delays with revenue maximization. In “Near-Optimal Pricing and Resource Allocation in a Large-Scale Service System,” Wu, Liu, and Sun propose a dual-based pricing and resource allocation policy that is both simple and theoretically powerful. This greedy, one-step heuristic delivers performance guarantees matching the theoretical lower bound.Beyond the stylized model that illustrates its core idea, the study shows the value of dynamic pricing through an insensitivity result: any work-conserving rule can stabilize the system. The policy also proves robust under realistic conditions, including heterogeneous server pools and nonexponential service environments.Perhaps most striking, the authors uncover a “compensation effect”: near-optimal pricing curves need not rise monotonically with congestion. Instead, they may offset customers’ delay disutility to sustain revenue. These insights offer a practical, theory-backed framework for modern service operations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large-scale online platforms launch hundreds of randomized experiments (also known as A/B tests) every day to iterate their operations and marketing strategies. The combinations of these treatments are typically not exhaustively tested, which triggers an important question of both academic and practical interest. Without observing the outcomes of all treatment combinations, how does one estimate the causal effect of any treatment combination and identify the optimal treatment combination? We develop a novel framework combining deep learning and doubly robust estimation to estimate the causal effect of any treatment combination for each user on the platform when observing only a small subset of treatment combinations. Our proposed framework (called debiased deep learning ( DeDL )) exploits Neyman orthogonality and combines interpretable and flexible structural layers in deep learning. We show theoretically that this framework yields efficient, consistent, and asymptotically normal estimators under mild assumptions, thus allowing for identifying the best treatment combination when observing only a few combinations. To empirically validate our method, we collaborated with a large-scale video-sharing platform and implemented our framework for three experiments involving three treatments, where each combination of treatments is tested. When observing only a subset of treatment combinations, our DeDL approach significantly outperforms other benchmarks to accurately estimate and infer the average treatment effect of any treatment combination and to identify the optimal treatment combination.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans will see significant changes in the future of work as collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) will become commonplace. This work explores the benefits of AI in the setting of judgment tasks when it replaces humans (automation) and when it works with humans (augmentation). Through an analytical modeling framework, we show that the optimal use of AI for automation or augmentation depends on different types of human-AI complementarity. Our analysis demonstrates that the use of automation increases with higher levels of between-task complementarity. In contrast, the use of augmentation increases with higher levels of within-task complementarity. We integrate both automation and augmentation roles into our task allocation framework, where an AI and humans work on a set of judgment tasks to optimize performance with a given level of available human resources. We validate our framework with an empirical study based on experimental data in which humans classify images with and without AI support. When between-task complementarity and within-task complementarity exist, we see a consistent distribution of work pattern for optimal work configurations; AI automates relatively easy tasks, AI augments humans on tasks with similar human and AI performance, and humans work without AI on relatively difficult tasks. Our work provides several contributions to theory and practice. The findings on the effects of complementarity provide a nuanced view regarding the benefits of automation and augmentation. Our task allocation framework highlights potential job designs for the future of work, especially by considering the often-ignored, critical role of human resource reallocation in improving organizational performance.This paper has been accepted by D.

    <title>EXPRESS: The Weekend Effect in Online Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper finds that online reviews submitted during the weekend tend to have lower rating scores than reviews submitted during the week. Analyzing 400 million reviews across 33 e-commerce, hospitality, entertainment, and employer platforms, the authors find that weekend reviews have a 3% lower relative share of 5-star ratings and a 6% higher relative share of 1-, 2-, or 3-star ratings compared to weekday reviews. The pattern emerges even when controlling for quality of reviewed items. This weekend effect is surprising given that studies usually report higher happiness levels and a better mood on weekends. The authors discuss several explanations related towherethe review is submitted (platform characteristics),whatthe review is about (listing characteristics), andwhosubmits the review (reviewer characteristics). They present evidence that temporal self-selection of reviewers is a dominant driver of the weekend effect. During the weekend, a different set of users—those more prone to write negative reviews—is more likely to select to leave a review. These findings complement extant research on review self-selection by adding a temporal layer to the self-selection processes inherent in online reviews. This paper also highlights managerial implications by demonstrating that solicitations sent during the weekend (versus weekday solicitation) lead to collecting more negative reviews.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Real‐world contracts are typically private, observed only by their direct signatories, so agents working together are vulnerable to the principal opportunistically reducing other agents' incentives. The principal can mitigate this commitment problem by giving the most skilled agent a budget and delegating authority to write other agents' contracts. This endogenous hierarchy, never optimal with public contracts, raises effort, output, and compensation but allows rent extraction. The principal prefers it when contracts are opaque enough, skill is sufficiently heterogeneous across agents, and joint output is sensitive enough to effort. Our model provides novel predictions for the structure of banking syndicates.</content>

    <title>Attention or Sentiment: How Social Media React to ESG?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the increasing attention associated with ESG investing, a natural yet overlooked question is how investors would react to the ESG performance of firms, given that investors’ activities can ultimately impact firm performance. Utilizing data from multiple sources, we empirically find that ESG performance positively predicts future social media attention, but it has no predictive ability for future social media sentiment. Furthermore, the significant positive association between ESG and social media attention holds for both ESG downgrade events and ESG upgrade events. Moreover, the positive association between ESG and social media attention is driven by the environmental and social factors, whereas the uncorrelation between ESG and social media sentiment is determined by the social and governance factors. These findings urge managers to pay close attention to keeping and improving their firms’ ESG advantage. They help managers shed light on the picture of the return of their firms’ investment in ESG by taking investor behavior into account. Besides, ESG’s inability in predicting social media sentiment also indicates retail investors’ limited awareness of the importance of ESG currently. Therefore, it is pressing for regulators to take actions to boost the function of sustainable investing and ESG values.</content>

    <title>When Gig Workers No Longer Gig: The Impact of California Assembly Bill 5 on the Online Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid growth of the gig economy has intensified debates over how to classify workers. California’s Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) reclassifies many independent contractors as employees, yet its practical effects on gig workers remain unclear. Using data from a major online labor platform and a difference-in-differences design, we provide one of the first empirical assessments of AB5’s impact on workers’ earnings. We find that California gig workers’ monthly earnings rose relative to workers in other states, but this increase was driven by longer working hours, offsetting a drop in hourly pay. These results highlight the complex trade-offs of reclassification: although workers may gain access to employee benefits, they may also experience reduced hourly rates and increased workloads. For policymakers, our findings offer evidence to guide similar initiatives under consideration in other states and underscore the need for nuanced, context-sensitive regulation. For platform managers, the results suggest opportunities to align platform design and worker education with evolving labor laws to support compliance and sustainable growth. Together, these insights inform future policy and platform strategies aimed at balancing worker protection with flexibility in the gig economy.</content>

    <title>Programming Tasks Impact Responses to Moral Dilemmas for Novice Programmers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid diffusion of programming skills across education and industry may impact how individuals consider moral dilemmas. Across a series of experiments, we show that performing even simple programming tasks shifts novice programmers’ evaluation of the classic trolley problem toward utilitarian responses. After solving a programming problem, respondents are more willing to sacrifice one life to save many. This effect arises because programming induces a deliberative, rule-based cognitive style. However, the effect diminishes with greater programming experience and can be mitigated through interventions, such as time delays or moral nudges. These findings highlight that organizations training employees in coding should be aware that programming tasks may temporarily alter moral reasoning, potentially influencing judgments in ethically charged contexts (e.g., product design, risk management, or AI development). Incorporating reflective cooling-off periods or explicit ethical reinforcement may reduce bias toward utilitarian reasoning. As programming becomes a baseline skill across the workforce, its cognitive spillovers could shape societal attitudes toward contested moral dilemmas. These include ethical trade-offs in settings such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems.</content>

    <title>Common purpose advantage: Reviving a managerial theory of the firm?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the most effective way to distribute organizational objectives across managers? While prior work suggests managers should each focus on a single objective, we draw on Barnard's original insights on corporate purpose to identify conditions when managers pursuing the full set of objectives is advantageous. Using a computational model, we find that moderate strategic diversity amongst managers enables practice sharing to generate sufficiently valuable distant search to offset the additional complexity incurred during local search, creating a “common purpose advantage.” The advantage is stronger with fewer objectives, moderate objective correlation, less diversification, and moderate turbulence. Under other conditions, it dissipates or reverses. This work unifies scattered findings on multi‐objective firms, contributes to diversification research, and revives interest in the Managerial Theory of the Firm.Managerial SummaryHow should a firm distribute its objectives across its managers? Should each manager focus on a single objective, or should all collectively pursue the full set? Our research identifies the conditions for a “common purpose advantage,” where all managers pursuing the full set of objectives is superior. Using a computational model, we demonstrate this advantage arises when moderate strategic diversity amongst managers enables the sharing of valuable practices, which generates performance gains that offset the complexity of handling multiple goals. This advantage is strongest with fewer objectives, moderate environmental turbulence, and in less diversified firms. Under other conditions—such as high turbulence, many objectives, or high diversification—this advantage dissipates or reverses, making each manager focusing on a single objective more effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional and shadow banks interacted in similar ways in the 2007 and COVID-19 crises, when both assets and liabilities flew out of shadow banks and into traditional banks. We explain these facts in a model of the coexistence of traditional and shadow banks in which liabilities and assets flow from the former to the latter in good times, avoiding regulation, and move the other way in a crisis, alleviating fire sales. The model sheds light on how regulations for traditional banks have (unintended) consequences on the shadow banking sector. (JEL G01, G21, G23, G38)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper derives ex-ante confidence intervals for stock risk premium forecasts that are based on a wide range of linear and machine learning models. Exploiting the cross-sectional variation in the precision of risk premium forecasts, I provide improved investment strategies. The confident-high-low strategies that take long-short positions exclusively on stocks with precise risk premium forecasts outperform traditional high-low strategies in delivering superior out-of-sample returns and Sharpe ratios across all models. The outperformance increases (decreases) with the model complexity (bias). The confident-high-low strategies are economically interpretable as trading strategies of ambiguity-averse investors who account for confidence intervals around risk premium forecasts.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that high productivity-based macroeconomic uncertainty is associated with greater accumulation of physical capital despite a reduction in investment and valuations. To reconcile this puzzling evidence, we show that uncertainty predicts lower aggregate depreciation of existing capital, which dominates the investment slowdown. We explain these findings by developing a quantitative production-based model in which firms implement precautionary savings through reducing utilization rather than raising investment. Through this novel intensive-margin mechanism, uncertainty shocks command a quarter of the equity premium in general equilibrium. Flexibility in utilization adjustments also helps explain uncertainty risk exposures in the cross-section of industry returns. (JEL G12, E32, D81, D50)</content>

    <title>The Quantity-Quality Tradeoff: How Incentives and Monitoring Shape Gender Differences at Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do women and men approach the same work differently? Prior research across occupations shows that men tend to emphasize quantity and produce more, whereas women prioritize quality. Researchers have attributed these differences to individual-level factors, such as gender-specific preferences, caregiving responsibilities, and evaluator biases. We propose that organizational practices, specifically production incentives and quality monitoring, also influence these patterns. Using data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we conceptualize the quantity-quality tradeoff using examiner leniency and leverage discontinuities in incentives and monitoring to assess their effects. We theorize and find that stronger production incentives lead men to be more lenient than women, prioritizing quantity. Under heightened monitoring, women are less lenient than men, emphasizing quality. Further, monitoring moderates the relationship between incentives and gender differences in leniency such that the largest gender gap occurs under strong incentives and weak monitoring. Our study demonstrates that organizational practices interact with worker gender to shape the quantity-quality tradeoff, indicating that incentive and monitoring systems—though not designed to affect gender inequality—produce distinct and unintended effects that are essential to understanding and addressing workplace disparities.Funding: We greatly appreciate funding support from the Gender &amp; Work Initiative at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17754 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;E-commerce retailers often need to make inventory decisions for new products under high uncertainty. We study a new business practice of using crowdvoting, wherein a retailer first seeks input from customers on the desirability of the product and then bases the purchasing decision on their votes. We collaborated with a subscription-based apparel rental platform and obtained a proprietary data set comprising the platform’s products and users. We leverage the staggered introduction of crowdvoting in different product categories to identify whether and, if so, by how much the adoption of crowdvoting improves business performance. We find that, after the adoption, both short- and long-term rental outcomes increase. We also uncover several mechanisms that drive this improvement. We find that the platform uses the wisdom of the crowd to make better inventory depth decisions, and the products are inherently a better match with users’ tastes. Moreover, we find that brands bought through crowdvoting are more likely to be newer brands compared with items that are bought solely through expert input. In other words, the diversity of the brands carried on the platform also improves. We also find that voters become more engaged with the platform: they post more reviews and are less likely to cancel their subscription after participating in crowdvoting. Our results have important implications for retailers who may be considering similar crowd-based strategies to improve their decision making.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01928 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than three decades after Oviatt and McDougall’s pioneering 1994 paper ‘Towards a theory of international new ventures’, the study of early internationalizing firms continues to captivate international business scholars. The research questions we address involve the antecedents of early internationalization, the dimensions of this phenomenon and its performance outcomes. In the present study, we include all three issues in a comprehensive meta‐analysis, thereby gaining a more complete understanding of the early internationalization process while building upon the various partial pathways identified in extant research. We use meta‐analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) and build upon 426 samples from 378 empirical studies. We distinguish between the effects of individual‐level and firm‐level antecedents on the main dimensions of early internationalization – speed, scope, and intensity – and we assess the impact thereof on post‐entry performance. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of the constructs used in prior research, thereby laying the foundation for future empirical studies on early internationalization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns about excessive mobile phone use among youth are mounting. We present estimates of both behavioral and contextual peer effects, along with comprehensive evidence on how students’ own and their peers’ app usage affect academic performance, physical health, and labor market outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data from a Chinese university covering three student cohorts over four years. We exploit random roommate assignments, differential exposure to a policy shock (gaming restrictions for minors), and differential exposure to a discrete event (the introduction of a blockbuster video game) for identification. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own usage by 5.8%. High app usage is harmful across all measured outcomes. A one s.d. increase in app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage reduces a student’s GPAs and wages through both disruptions and behavioral spillovers, generating a total negative effect that exceeds half the magnitude of the impact from the student’s own app usage. Extending China’s three-hour-per-week gaming restriction for minors to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.9%. High-frequency GPS and app usage data show that heavy app users spend less time in study halls, are more frequently late or absent from class, and get less sleep.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, many firms have prioritized both pay equity (i.e., closing pay gaps associated with target groups such as women and racial minorities) and equitable representation (i.e., ensuring these target groups are fairly represented across a firm’s hierarchy). We use formal modeling and simulations to show how efforts to close pay gaps across multiple groups can undermine equitable representation. Specifically, our analysis suggests that pressure for pay equity creates a cost-based financial incentive to enact a subtle form of tokenism: A firm may minimize the cost of closing pay gaps if it maintains a workforce with a small number of minority women whom it pays well in order to compensate for underpaying larger numbers of majority women and minority men who resemble each other in terms of job attributes and personal qualifications. A firm can avoid these outcomes if it focuses on ensuring that employees from target groups are equitably rewarded for job attributes and personal qualifications rather than minimizing cost. But an equitable-rewards approach can be substantially more expensive than a cost-minimization approach, especially if pay gaps are larger in high-wage jobs or if there are many target groups. We conclude by offering testable empirical predictions and recommending a practical solution, namely to include terms for intersectional categories (e.g., minority women) in the regressions used to estimate pay gaps.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18306 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recordkeepers in defined contribution (DC) pension plans are often paid indirectly in the form of revenue sharing from third-party funds on the menu. We show that these arrangements affect the investment menu of 401(k) plans. Revenue-sharing funds are more likely to be added to the menu and are less likely to be deleted. Overall, revenue-sharing plans are more expensive, as higher expense ratios are not offset by lower direct fees or by superior performance. Rebates increase with the market power of the recordkeeper, suggesting that third-party funds may share revenues to gain access to retirement assets.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: The research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the TIAA-CREF Institute through the Pension Research Council/Boettner Center (PRC) of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01560 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Offline Demand Learning and Pricing with Separable Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper, inspired by a collaboration with a leading consumer electronics retailer in the Middle East, explores the challenge of demand learning and pricing using separable demand models. The data scarcity issue, characterized by limited price changes and low sales volumes, renders traditional models ineffective in deriving reasonable price elasticity. To address this issue, we advocate a separable model that leverages two submodels to distinctly capture the effects of price and contextual information. The separable structure enables us to invest special emphasis on the role of price and impose specific structural assumptions on the submodel for pricing effects, such as the monotone decreasing property. Theoretical analysis sheds light on the statistical complexity of demand learning with the separable structure, highlighting its capacity to reduce the necessary sample size to achieve a desired level of accuracy. We also introduce a computationally efficient iterative algorithm for deriving submodels from offline datasets, complete with convergence guarantees. In an empirical context, we demonstrate how our method can yield meaningful price elasticity estimations and revenue increase based on real sales data from the retailer.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Political Heterogeneity and Societal Polarization Impair Individual Performance: Evidence from Random Assignment in Professional Golf</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how political heterogeneity in groups affects individual performance in settings where people work alongside others. Leveraging the random assignment of golfers to groups in Professional Golfers’ Association Tour tournaments, we find that golfers score 0.2 strokes better per round when playing in politically homogeneous versus heterogeneous groups. This corresponds to a five-rank improvement before the tournament cut and an additional $13,000–$23,400 in tournament earnings. The effect intensifies during periods of high societal political polarization and diminishes when polarization is low. We propose that politically heterogeneous groups create a more stressful and less psychologically safe environment, reducing focus and leading to reduced performance. Consistent with this mechanism, analyses of shot-level data reveal that this effect is strongest during driving and putting shots when players are in close physical proximity. Our study contributes to the understanding of how political heterogeneity in groups affects individual performance in competitive settings, with implications for managing ideological differences in organizations.This paper was accepted by Sameer Srivastava, organizations.Funding: The authors appreciate financial help from Yale University and Fox International [fellowship].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01798 .</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Information Exchange Within Groups: The Role of Voting Protocols in U.S. Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complex and important decisions are often made with advice from a committee of experts. But how do a committee’s “rules of engagement” affect the way individuals discuss, how they vote, and ultimately the quality of their collective recommendation? Compiling verbatim transcripts from U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meetings, we study how a 2007 switch from sequential to simultaneous voting procedures changed discussions, information exchange, and decision making. Consistent with past findings, we show that, compared with a sequential voting protocol, simultaneous voting led to a reduction in the likelihood of unanimous votes. Importantly, we show novel evidence that the majority of this reduction in unanimity was mediated by changes in discussion patterns—specifically, by the increased diversity of information surfaced during discussions. We also find evidence of behavioral and linguistic changes that support our theory that voting protocols changed the incentives for members to elicit more diverse information from each other: under simultaneous voting, members exhibited greater equality in talking time, directed a greater proportion of questions to each other, and adopted language that was more positive, authentic, and equal in projecting status and confidence. Finally, we show that recommendations under simultaneous voting were more likely to be accurate, as drugs recommended and approved were less likely to encounter safety-related postmarket events. In sum, voting protocols affect the incentives for individuals to engage in robust discussions, leading to marked improvements in how information is exchanged between individuals, and in the process by which groups of experts arrive at joint recommendations.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03649 .</content>

    <title>The Competitive Ratio of Threshold Policies for Online Unit-Density Knapsack Problems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a wholesale supply chain ordering problem. In this problem, the supplier has an initial stock and faces an unpredictable stream of incoming orders, making real-time decisions on whether to accept or reject each order. What makes this wholesale supply chain ordering problem special is its knapsack constraint; that is, we do not allow partially accepting an order or splitting an order. The objective is to maximize the utilized stock. We model this wholesale supply chain ordering problem as an online unit-density knapsack problem. We study randomized threshold algorithms that accept an item as long as its size exceeds the threshold. We derive two optimal threshold distributions, the first is 0.4324-competitive relative to the optimal off-line integral packing, and the second is 0.4285-competitive relative to the optimal off-line fractional packing. Both results require optimizing the cumulative distribution function of the random threshold, which are challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problems. We also consider the generalization to multiple knapsacks, in which an arriving item has a different size in each knapsack. We derive a 0.2142-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem cannot be more than 0.4605-competitive. This is the first upper bound strictly less than 0.5, which implies the intrinsic challenge of the knapsack constraint. We show how to naturally implement our optimal threshold distributions in the warehouses of a Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on its order data that demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology–Accenture Alliance for Business Analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01577 .</content>

    <title>Appearing Authentic: How Dress Formality Influences Perceived Authenticity in Investment Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article explores the important but understudied topic of authenticity in investment evaluations. Building on research in authenticity and signaling theory, we theorize how visual first impressions, such as clothing, can generate perceptions of authenticity that lead investors to overlook later quality signals, including a lack of prior experience. We found support for our theory in two field studies and a randomized experiment: investors tend to perceive entrepreneurs who are casually dressed as more authentic than those formally dressed, which is associated with higher investor evaluations. Moreover, perceptions of authenticity generated by casual clothes crowd out later signals: Casually dressed entrepreneurs are evaluated highly regardless of their entrepreneurial experience, but formally dressed entrepreneurs are penalized for perceived inexperience. We discuss the implications of our findings for authenticity research, the temporal order of signals, and early-stage investments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents new stylized facts about returns and cashflow growth rates on stocks and housing over decade‐long holding periods. While cashflow growth rates on the two assets comove positively, their returns comove negatively until the Global Financial Crisis and positively thereafter. These facts present a puzzle for representative‐agent models that imply positive return comovement for assets with similar cashflows. I consider a heterogeneous‐agent model with segmented stock and housing markets connected through credit. News about the aggregate economy generates negative return comovement. Recent shifts such as wealthier homebuyers and institutional housing purchases reduce the importance of credit and segmentation.</content>

    <title>To Own or to Rent? The Effects of Transaction Taxes on Housing Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using sales and leasing data, this paper finds three novel effects of a higher property transaction tax: higher buy-to-rent transactions alongside lower buy-to-own transactions despite both being taxed, a lower sales-to-leases ratio, and a lower price-to-rent ratio. This paper explains these facts by developing a search model with entry of investors and households, households choosing to own or rent in the presence of credit frictions, and homeowners deciding when to move house. A higher transaction tax reduces homeowners’ mobility and increases demand for rental properties, which explains the empirical facts and leads to a lower homeownership rate. The deadweight loss is large at 111% of tax revenue, with more than half of this due to distorting decisions to own or rent.</content>

    <title>Conceptual and Theoretical Perspectives on the Human Resource Management–Leadership–Well‐Being Link: Reviewing 20 Years of Empirical Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) practices and leadership (LS) both impact the functioning and experiences of employees at work, or, in other words, their well‐being (WB). Over the last two decades, the body of empirical research on employee WB that considers aspects of HRM and LS has been growing. There is a myriad of theoretical perspectives, such as job resource theories, social exchange theory, and HRM theories, that can serve as the foundation for empirical inquiry. In addition, the interplay between HRM and LS in impacting employee WB can be conceptualized in many different ways, for example, parallel effects, moderation, and mediation. This literature review takes stock of two decades of empirical HRM–LS–WB research, examines its theoretical and conceptual assumptions, and its temporal developments. We find that the field views the link between HRM, LS, and WB predominantly as an exchange between employee and employer, has a strong tendency to combine social exchange theory with other theoretical frameworks, and is shifting to theories that place the employees at the center of inquiry (e.g., motivational theories). In terms of the interplay between HRM, LS, and WB, we observe a shift toward conceptualizations that focus on the enabling potential of LS and HRM for each other as well as models that focus on the indirect—rather than direct—effects of HRM and LS on WB. We discuss the findings and implications for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leadership research has evolved towards increasing conceptual and methodological precision, yielding refined constructs and robust empirical insights. However, this editorial argues that a singular focus on precision risks fragmenting the field and distancing scholarship from the complex realities of organizational life. Drawing on contributions fromJMS, this thematic collection illustrates how leadership is a dynamic, contextually embedded phenomenon shaped by interdependent forces. By ‘zooming out’, scholarship can better reflect the messy, adaptive nature of leadership and offer more actionable insights for leaders navigating today’s organizational challenges. We propose a multidimensional framework – breadth, depth, and height – to reintroduce complexity into leadership studies. Breadth captures the diversity of leadership styles and disciplinary perspectives; depth explores the psychological, symbolic, and relational undercurrents of those diverse perspectives; and height examines how diverse perspectives play out differently across hierarchical levels and systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While increasing evidence supports the workplace benefits of green human resource management (HRM) practices, this research explores how and when employees' experiences with these practices influence their green behaviors at home. Drawing on the work‐home resource model, this study examines the dual mechanisms of green job demands and resources while also exploring the moderating role of proactive vitality management. Study 1, a four‐wave time‐lagged survey, revealed that experienced green HRM practices were associated with both green job demands and green job resources. On the one hand, green job demands led to increased green job fatigue, which in turn reduced green behaviors at home. On the other hand, green job resources fostered green self‐efficacy, which subsequently enhanced green behaviors at home. Importantly, the negative indirect relationship between green HRM practices and green behaviors at home via green job demands and green job fatigue was stronger when employees' proactive vitality management was low, whereas the positive indirect relationship via green job resources and green self‐efficacy was stronger when proactive vitality management was high. Study 2, a four‐wave cross‐lagged survey, replicated the findings of Study 1 and further clarified the causal direction of these relationships. This research contributes to the literature on green HRM practices by uncovering their cross‐domain implications and highlighting both their benefits and costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can organizations establish collaboration between their established members and a newly hired member? We address this question by studying firms undergoing scaling using a multiple‐case study. We find that widely involving the new hire into the established managers' activities backfires. Such extensive involvement is intended to build the same kind of strong, personal relationships with the new hire that the established managers share amongst themselves and, in doing so, establish collaboration. But the established managers' relationships turn out to beirreplicable. Being extensively involved without possessing the same kind of relationships, the new hire becomes perceived as anintruder. In contrast, involving the new hire more selectively led to the new hire becoming respected as a relationally distant but professionally appreciated “stranger,” which engendered effective collaboration.Managerial SummaryCollaboration between a company's newly hired and established managers is necessary for it to scale but difficult to establish. Many firms mistakenly attempt to involve a new hire in the established managers' activities as much as possible, hoping to build strong personal bonds quickly. We show that this strategy often backfires. The kind of relationships that the established managers have is not easy to replicate, and widely involving the new hire in the absence of such relationships can spur the established managers to perceive the new hire as an intruder. Instead, limiting the new hire's involvement to only the activities directly linked to his or her job may result in the new hire becoming respected as a professional “stranger.” Doing so avoids the discomfort of forced closeness and facilitates effective collaboration.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Value of Blending - Managing Ameliorating Inventory Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stocks of some food products, such as whiskey, cheese, or port wine, ameliorate during storage, facilitating product differentiation according to age. This induces a trade-off between immediate revenues and further maturation. Inventory management decisions include purchasing volumes of agricultural produce and production volumes for age-differentiated products. Because products can be blended from stocks of different ages, issuance decisions offer operational flexibility. However, whereas some industries (port wine, sherry) only request that the product labels refer to the average age of issued stocks, others (whiskey, rum) have stricter blending regulations, requiring that the product labels represent the minimum age of all components. Further, producers must deal with multiple uncertainties. Purchase prices of agricultural commodities depend on volatile climate-dependent harvest seasons, stocks decay during maturation, and sales market conditions fluctuate. We solve this inventory management problem using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with three key innovations: (i) a novel actor pipeline that decomposes the action space and flexibly partitions decision dimensions between a neural network and a lookahead optimization model, (ii) an algorithm explicitly maximizing average rewards, and (iii) reward-handling techniques that exploit structural problem insights. Our approach yields near-optimal policies that consistently outperform benchmark heuristics. Beyond the algorithmic contributions, our results offer new managerial insights into the value of blending under uncertainty. Minimum-age blending substantially enhances the profits of firms as compared to no blending because companies can adjust their purchasing policy in response to price fluctuations. The more flexible average-age regime further improves profits by 8.7% on average, suggesting that whiskey and rum regulators may wish to reconsider their strict blending rules. We mine black-box policies from deep reinforcement learning using supervised machine learning and Shapley values to analyze near-optimal decision drivers. Exploiting the value of blending requires producers to install sufficient processing capacity, especially when dealing with large variations in harvest seasons. Additionally, blending entails increased planning complexity because the inventory management decisions are driven by a large number of factors.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Unveiling the Human Touch: Enhancing Customer Satisfaction through Personal Profiles of Social Media Customer Service Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are rapidly adopting social media platforms to optimize their customer service operations. Given the central role of social media as a primary point of contact with customers and the critical importance of maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction, it is imperative to craft positive experiences during service interactions. To enhance customer interaction with a personal touch, U.S. telecom giant T-Mobile replaced standardized profiles with personal profiles for its social media customer service agents on Twitter. Leveraging this exogenous change, we investigate how these personal profiles affect customer behaviors within service operations. We adopt a Difference-in-Differences empirical strategy in this research. The results show that implementing personal profiles for customer service agents increases positive sentiment in customer tweets, reduces the likelihood of complaints, and improves overall satisfaction. Further analyses suggest that the effects vary across customer groups, with greater impact among verified Twitter users and female customers. While personalized agent profiles can enhance satisfaction, they also heighten expectations for timely responses, making delays more detrimental than with standardized profiles. To explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an online randomized experiment. In addition to reinforcing the causal inference from our secondary data analysis, causal mediation analysis of the experimental data shows that personal agent profiles influence satisfaction and the likelihood of customers expressing gratitude through the perceived warmth and perceived competence of the agents. Interestingly, while the effect on gratitude is mediated by humanization, we do not find a similar mediation effect on satisfaction. This suggests distinct pathways through which humanization shapes different aspects of the customer experience.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Conformity or Differentiation? How Consumers Respond to the (In)consistency between Product Ratings and Review Sentiments in the US and China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates the joint impact of numeric ratings and review sentiments in prior product reviews on consumers’ product evaluations and how this impact varies between individualist and collectivist cultures. Using data on 115,231 consumer reviews of 167 American movies released both in the US and China, the authors find that the joint impact of movie ratings and review sentiments varies with the consistency between the two information sources, as well as their valence. Furthermore, their analysis reveals that the joint impact differs between the two cultures. The authors suggest that these findings may arise because consumers’ perception of information credibility varies depending on the information consistency and their cultural background. The findings offer important implications for firms in managing UGC platforms for consumers’ product reviews and social media across global markets.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Beyond Cookies: Evidence about Team Coproduction and Engagement Retention from Girl Scouts Cookie Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retention is a critical challenge for organizations, especially nonprofits, which often face higher turnover than for-profit firms. Unlike many for-profits, nonprofits have fewer financial resources to retain participants, so continued participation depends more on team climate and opportunities to learn by working together. We study these dynamics in the Girl Scouts Cookie Program. We collect sales and troop membership information between 2016 and 2018 from a local Girl Scout council consisting of approximately 30,000 members. We examine the effects of a group of three team diversity features: disparity, variety, and separation, on a Girl Scout’s decision to return to sell cookies the following year. Our results suggest that a more evenly distributed sales performance within the troop (i.e., low sales disparity) is associated with higher retention, with larger gains for lower sellers. In addition, greater grade level (i.e., age) variety is associated with higher retention for both younger and older participants. Furthermore, mixing newcomers with returnees (i.e., high return-status separation) has asymmetric dual effects: high return-status separation tends to discourage new girls from returning while encouraging returning girls to stay. Finally, we find that returning participants tend to sell more in subsequent years, consistent with learning-by-doing. These empirical results have implications for the GSUSA and other similar NPOs to compose teams and organize collaboration activities to improve engagement and enhance learning.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: No News about Climate Action Is Good News for Low-Polluting Firms</title>
    <updated>2025-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception of firms, significantly impacting their operations and performance. Firms often attempt to influence media channels to showcase their climate action initiatives, aiming to enhance their public image, reputation, and stakeholder trust. While firms cannot directly control their media coverage, intentional or unintentional dissemination of their climate action efforts can thrust them into the media spotlight. The implications of this media spotlight remain uncertain. While firms may anticipate positive public relations benefits from such exposure, it may also raise environmental expectations for the firm and risk highlighting less favorable aspects of their environmental practices. Despite previous research on the impact of media exposure on firms’ financial outcomes, a notable gap exists in understanding how the media spotlight on firms’ climate actions affects their operational and financial performance. A clear hurdle is the lack of a systematic and objective measurement of such a spotlight. Our study addresses this research gap by developing a machine learning-based framework to derive a climate action vocabulary as a novel information artifact. The vocabulary is subsequently used to measure the intensity of media attention on a firm’s climate actions. Our research reveals that an increased media spotlight on climate actions, regardless of their sentiment, has an adverse effect on firms’ financial performance, primarily due to the rise in operational costs. Furthermore, we find that the impact of media spotlight is heterogeneous. Low-polluting firms experience negative financial consequences as the downside of the heightened media spotlight. In contrast, high-polluting firms and those operating in polluting industries may witness an overall positive financial impact. We also find that firms’ market orientation (B2B vs. B2C), durability classification, index constituency (i.e., S&amp;P 500), and greenwashing status significantly moderate the relationship. Our research highlights key considerations for corporate leaders with respect to the drawbacks for low-polluting firms in seeking media attention for their climate actions. Given that the media captures society’s limited attention, our research suggests that firms should refrain from promoting superficial narratives about climate change that distract society from more impactful sustainability conversations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing School Seat Allocation to Improve Access and FairnessA growing shortage of public school seats in Chile has left thousands of students unassigned each year. In their forthcoming Operations Research paper, “Capacity Planning in Stable Matching,” Bobbio et al. (2025) develop a novel framework that jointly determines where to expand school capacities and computes a student-optimal stable assignment in the enlarged market. The study develops exact and heuristic methods that make this theoretically complex problem tractable in practice. Using rich administrative data from the Chilean school choice system, the framework demonstrates how adding a limited number of seats can trigger improvement chains benefiting multiple students, also revealing diminishing marginal returns to capacity expansion. Beyond the Chilean context, the framework provides a versatile toolkit that can be adapted to other constrained allocation problems, offering a rigorous foundation for data-driven policy design in education and beyond.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving the Discriminant Validation of Multi-Item Scales</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discriminant validation examines to what extent constructs measured with multi-item scales, which are hypothesized to be conceptually distinct, are empirically distinct. A literature review of published scale development studies shows that a variety of criteria and approaches to assess discriminant validity are in use. However, the requirements for an appropriate criterion have not been spelled out, which has led to the use of problematic criteria. The present research introduces three requirements that an appropriate discriminant validation criterion should satisfy, concerning the correlation, comparison standard, and comparison method. It shows that the common Fornell and Larcker criterion is based on an inappropriate comparison standard and method and that alternative criteria have weaknesses as well. The authors therefore propose an improved comparison standard, congeneric reliability (CR), and develop a systematic discriminant validation procedure based on CR and an existing criterion (Phi), both of which satisfy the three requirements. The procedure provides continuous measures of support for discriminant validity and accounts for measurement and sampling error. A detailed case study and reanalyses of seven published scale development articles demonstrate the application and strengths of the procedure. Example code and an online application facilitate its implementation.</content>

    <title>The Double-Edged Roles of Generative AI in the Creative Process: Experiments on Design Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative AI (GenAI) promises to revolutionize creative work, but its value is not universal. Using controlled lab settings with students and real-world tests with professional designers, our research shows that GenAI is a double-edged tool. In the initial brainstorming (ideation) stage, GenAI reliably boosts creativity for all users. However, in the execution (implementation) stage, whereas novice designers continue to benefit from GenAI’s assistance, expert designers encounter inefficiencies—spending significantly more time without improving creativity, because GenAI’s methods conflict with experts’ well-established routines. For firms, this means adoption strategies must be nuanced. GenAI delivers the greatest value when applied to brainstorming, early concept development, and work by less-experienced employees. In contrast, deploying GenAI in later-stage production tasks, especially with seasoned professionals, may reduce efficiency. Managers and tool designers should avoid blanket promotion of GenAI across all tasks and instead develop targeted adoption strategies that align with employees’ expertise and the stage of the creative process. By tailoring GenAI use, organizations can harness its creative potential while minimizing risks of counterproductive outcomes.</content>

    <title>Family‐Friendly Work Systems: A Systematic Review, Critical Assessment, and Future Research Agenda of the Work‐Life Benefits Literature</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing awareness and use of family‐friendly work activities (FFWAs), also known as work‐life benefits, highlights their importance for both employees and organizations. Despite the importance of these activities for both employees and organizations, the existing literature is fragmented, lacking a clear consensus on their conceptualization and measurement. In this review, we content analyze conceptual and methodological aspects of the FFWA literature. Specifically, applying the systems perspective from the strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature, we introduce and conceptualize family‐friendly work systems (FFWS), define their key domains, specify the FFWAs within them, and clarify their hierarchical structure (i.e., policies, practices, and processes). Building on the FFWS model, we evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity in current research. By identifying inconsistencies as well as strengths and weaknesses in the existing literature, this review provides a timely contribution that can guide future research and offer practical recommendations for policymakers and organizations striving to create more family‐friendly workplaces.</content>

    <title>Bridging Moral Aspirations and the Mundane Reality: A Grounded Study of the Process of Radical Purpose Adaptation in a Business School</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In previous research, scholars have often highlighted the important role of leaders in defending and protecting a historical organizational purpose. However, adopting such a ‘backward‐looking’ perspective, researchers have devoted much less attention to understanding how an organizational purpose can be deliberately changed and leveraged to justify novel moral commitments, thereby bridging the moral and the mundane. We theorize these activities as a process of radical purpose adaptation, whereby an established organization deliberately and radically changes its purpose to align with its commitment to society. We draw on a single, longitudinal case study of a business school as it engaged in the process of changing its organizational purpose. Adopting a social‐symbolic work lens, we conceptualize purpose as a social‐symbolic object and theorize purpose work, which captures leaders’ efforts to establish new organizational aspirations. We find that proactive purpose work leads to the unintended emergence of self‐reinforcing, competing demands that threaten the new purpose, which are tackled through reactive purpose work. Thus, a recursive process emerges in which proactive and reactive purpose work operate in tandem: proactive work generates novel aspirations and tensions, while reactive work contains and redirects them, enabling organizations to stabilize new commitments without abandoning their transformative intent.</content>

    <title>Concentration in cross‐border research collaborations and &lt;scp&gt;MNCs&lt;/scp&gt;' knowledge creation in a host country</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study elucidates the previously underexplored structural heterogeneity inherent in multinational corporations' (MNCs) internal linkages by examining the concentration of cross‐border collaborations among inventors within host countries. Building on the boundary spanning literature, we develop a two‐stage framework identifying the knowledge distortion mechanism arising from this concentration: information overload in the cross‐country knowledge absorption stage and long transmission paths and knowledge hoarding in the within‐country diffusion stage. Both hinder local knowledge creation. We further propose that cross‐country and within‐country network structures serve as contingencies moderating this relationship. The negative effects of collaboration concentration are exacerbated by structural holes in cross‐country networks but attenuated by the reach and density of within‐country networks. Empirical results based on American pharmaceutical MNCs from 1980 to 2008 support our hypotheses.Managerial SummaryEffectively structuring internal cross‐border R&amp;D collaborations is crucial for MNCs seeking to enhance local innovation outcomes. Although many firms focus on increasing cross‐border linkages, this study highlights that overlooking how collaborations are distributed among inventors can obscure key drivers of innovation performance. This research shows that given the number of cross‐border linkages, their concentration in the hands of a few inventors within a host country hinders local knowledge creation. The negative effect is amplified when the host country spans many structural holes in the cross‐country network. A well‐structured within‐country network with high reach or high density can help mitigate the effect by facilitating knowledge diffusion. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the structural and geographic configuration of internal MNC networks in global R&amp;D strategy.</content>

    <title>An Analysis of Laparoscopic and Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgeries: Surgeon Experience, Learning, and Task Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study examines the transfer of learning in the context of different surgical methods used to complete surgical procedures. Surgeons' total experience is characterized by the procedure (i.e., focal or different) and the surgical technology or method used (i.e., laparoscopic‐assisted minimally invasive surgery [LAS] or robot‐assisted minimally invasive surgery [RAS]). Using data from a large US university hospital with specialized surgical departments, and drawing on task‐technology fit and fit appropriation model theories, we propose three novel hypotheses that focus on different facets of how learning transfers across methods and tasks for individuals. The findings contribute to research on individual learning by distinguishing between method learning (how the task is performed) and task learning (the knowledge of the task itself). We find the following key findings. First, the experience from the RAS (LAS) method has a significant (no) effect in reducing LAS (RAS) duration for the same procedure. Second, learning from other procedures is contingent on the method used to complete the task. Specifically, the experience from other procedures completed using the LAS (RAS) method increases (decreases) the LAS (RAS) duration. Overall, the results indicate that the transfer of learning from RAS to LAS is greater than from LAS to RAS. This suggests that learning transfer across technologies is asymmetrical and requires careful consideration regarding how accumulated surgical experience from various technologies impacts task performance. From a task‐technology fit and fit appropriation model theory perspective, our study highlights the importance of technologies' capabilities in knowledge transfer across methods.</content>

    <title>Internal venturing as a signal: How entrepreneurial employees gain career benefits in organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do employees benefit from acting entrepreneurially in a corporate environment? Drawing on signaling theory, we propose that entrepreneurial behaviors lead to tangible career benefits through the creation of new internal ventures, which serve as a credible signal of an employee's leadership potential. Using a time‐lagged design with a sample of 643 employees, we found in Study 1 that employees engaging in higher levels of entrepreneurial behaviors are more likely to create new internal ventures, which subsequently lead to more promotions and—in larger organizations—higher compensation. Study 2 employed a within‐subjects design to directly evaluate the signaling value of new internal venture creation. Together, our findings highlight internal venturing as a key mechanism through which entrepreneurial employees can gain career benefits within established organizations.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurial employees are often seen as organizational misfits. Yet, our research shows that acting entrepreneurially in a corporate environment can enhance employees' career success through new internal venture creation. In two studies, we find that employees engaging in higher levels of entrepreneurial behaviors—asking questions to challenge the status quo, observing with fresh perspectives, exchanging ideas across diverse networks, and experimenting with new approaches—are more likely to launch new internal corporate ventures. The act of new internal venture creation, in turn, leads to more promotions and—in larger organizations—higher compensation, because it sends a positive signal of an employee's leadership potential. Our findings offer practical insights for both entrepreneurial employees and organizations seeking to foster entrepreneurial spirit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We educate investors about the benefits of dividend reinvestment and costs of misperceiving dividends as free income. The intervention increases planned dividend reinvestment in survey responses. Using trading records, we observe a causal increase in dividend reinvestment in the field of roughly 50 cents for every euro received. This holds relative to investors’ prior behavior and various control samples. Investors who learned the most from the intervention update their trading the most. The results suggest the free dividends fallacy is a significant source of dividend demand. Our study demonstrates that simple, targeted, and focused educational interventions can affect investment behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of introducing junior unsecured loans (i.e., FinTech loans) into the small business lending market. Using French administrative data, we find that firms experience a 13% increase in bank credit after receiving a FinTech loan. We use propensity score matching procedures and a shift-share instrument to account for credit demand. The credit increase only occurs when FinTech borrowers invest in new assets, and Fintech borrowers are subsequently more likely to pledge collateral to banks. This suggests that firms use FinTech loans to acquire assets that they then pledge to banks, thereby increasing total borrowing capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit information in patent applications to construct an instrumental variable for the identification of technology news shocks that relaxes all the identifying assumptions traditionally used in the literature. The instrument recovers news shocks that have no effect on aggregate productivity in the short-run, but are a significant driver of its trend component. The shock prompts a broad-based expansion in anticipation of the future increase in total factor productivity (TFP), with output, consumption, and investment all rising well before any material increase in TFP is recorded. Despite the positive conditional comovements, the shock only accounts for a modest share of fluctuations of macroeconomic aggregates at business cycle frequencies. Financial markets price-in news shocks on impact, while most of the macro aggregates respond with some delay.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Environmental externalities – uncompensated damages imposed on others – lie at the root of climate change, pollution, deforestation and biodiversity loss. Empirical evidence is limited, however, as to how externalities drive private decision making. We study one such behavior, illegal tropical forest fires, using 15 years of daily satellite data covering over 107,000 fires across Indonesia. Weather-induced variation in fire spread risk and variation in who owns surrounding land allow us to identify how far externalities influence the decision to use fire. Relative to when all spread risks are internalized, we find that firms overuse fire when surrounded by unleased government lands where property rights are weak. In contrast, and consistent with the Coase Theorem, firms treat risks to nearby private concessions similarly to risks to their own land. Government sanctions, concentrated on fires spreading to populated areas, also deter fires, consistent with Pigouvian deterrence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the consequences of “regime-induced” exchange rate depreciations by comparing outcomes for peggers versus floaters to the U.S. dollar in response to a dollar depreciation. Pegger currencies depreciate relative to floater currencies and these depreciations are strongly expansionary. The boom is associated with a fall in net exports, and (if anything) an increase in interest rates in the pegger countries. This suggests that expenditure switching and domestic monetary policy are not the main drivers of the boom. We show that a large class of existing models cannot match our estimated responses and develop a model with imperfect financial openness that can. Following a depreciation, uncovered interest parity deviations lower the costs of borrowing from abroad and stimulate the economy, as in the data. The model is consistent with (unconditional) exchange rate disconnect and the Mussa fact, even though exchange rates have large effects on the economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a California field experiment, I investigated the impact of a Facebook outreach campaign aimed at increasing enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The campaign used a promising marketing strategy known as “retargeting,” where ads were delivered to a randomly selected subset of over 16,000 eligible nonparticipants who had nearly completed the SNAP application process, while a control group remained unaffected. Despite leveraging ad content developed in collaboration with nonprofit and government partners, the campaign did not produce statistically or economically significant increases in enrollment, even when considering the extreme values of estimated confidence intervals.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by Code for America and the National Institute on Aging [Grant T32-AG000186].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06312 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While artificial intelligence (AI)‐based conversational technologies offer exciting prospects in healthcare, the lack of transparency and elevated privacy concerns in using such technologies remain a challenge and make much‐needed information difficult to obtain while administering patient care. Approaches that emphasize transparency and interpretability of AI systems provide a promising avenue to address these concerns. In this study, we explore the role of transparency‐enhancing explanations as a way for caregivers to elicit truthful disclosure of otherwise private information from patients. Specifically, we explore how automated explanations provisioned by conversational technologies can help reduce the user's privacy concerns and bring about self‐disclosure, thus helping to improve key outcomes such as accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Through an online experiment with 556 participants in a healthcare context, we uncover the mediating effects of two critical factors, informational justice and perceived relevance, on privacy concerns. We find that explanations foster perceptions of informational justice and perceived relevance in the user, which help reduce privacy concerns and bring about self‐disclosure. The study's findings have implications for researchers as well as practitioners who leverage conversational technologies in healthcare and other service contexts.</content>

    <title>Subtle Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the concept ofsubtle discrimination—biased acts that cannot be objectively ascertained as discriminatory. When candidates compete for promotions by investing in skills, firms' subtle biases induce discriminated candidates to overinvest when promotions are low‐stakes (to distinguish themselves from favored candidates) but underinvest in high‐stakes settings (anticipating low promotion probabilities). This asymmetry implies that subtle discrimination raises profits in low‐productivity firms but lowers them in high‐productivity firms. Although subtle biases are small, they generate large gaps in skills and promotion outcomes. We derive further predictions in contexts such as equity analysis, lending, fund flows, banking careers, and entrepreneurial finance.</content>

    <title>Going for Broke: Bank Reputation and the Performance of Opaque Securities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can banks’ reputational concerns improve the quality of opaque, off‐balance sheet securities, such as mortgage‐backed securities? We study this question in a uniquely parsimonious setting. In the 1760s, Dutch banking partnerships securitized West‐Indian plantation mortgages that were risky and opaque. High‐reputation banks originated better mortgages and issued securities that, on average, retained 17.5% more of their value during a market collapse. Reputational effects are attenuated when the managing partners were married into wealth or received a large share of profits in the short term, suggesting that bank reputation only works if bankers are personally exposed to (long‐run) reputational losses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using confidential supervisory risk ratings, we document that banks increase risk after going public compared to a control group of banks that filed to go public but withdrew their filings for plausibly exogenous reasons. The increase in risk improves short‐term performance at the expense of long‐term performance. We argue that the increase in risk stems from pressure to maximize short‐term stock prices and earnings once the bank is publicly traded. After going public, banks owned by investors that place greater value on short‐term performance increase risk more, and those managed by CEOs with more short‐term compensation also increase risk more.</content>

    <title>Unveiling the Strategic Impacts of Extending Membership-Based Free Shipping Programs Beyond the Online Marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online marketplaces are increasingly extending their membership-based free shipping (MFS) programs to include external sellers, transforming logistics capabilities into a “logistics-as-a-service” (LaaS) model. This study uses a game-theoretic approach to analyze the implications of such extensions, with Amazon as a leading example. Contrary to the widespread belief that LaaS is a stand-alone profit center, our findings reveal that the primary value of extended MFS lies in enhancing the marketplace’s core business. By attracting member consumers and optimizing fulfillment operations, marketplaces can increase commission revenues and reduce per-order logistics costs—even if LaaS itself operates at a loss. Importantly, this strategy can benefit the broader marketplace ecosystem, including both internal and external sellers and member consumers, while potentially disadvantaging nonmembers. For practitioners and policymakers, these results underscore the need to rethink competitive dynamics and pricing strategies in digital platforms. Rather than viewing extended MFS solely as a logistics monetization tool, it should be seen as a strategic lever for shaping marketplace structure, seller participation, and consumer behavior.</content>

    <title>Anti‐labor environments and employee entrepreneurship: Evidence from right‐to‐work laws</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how changes in labor unions and related labor environments affect employees' likelihood of starting a new business. We suggest that the enactment of stringent anti‐union laws reduces incentives for employees to stay with their respective workplaces and increases the attractiveness of becoming self‐employed. Using the adoption of right‐to‐work (RTW) laws in Michigan and Indiana as a quasi‐natural experiment, we find that the likelihood of employees becoming self‐employed increased by 53% compared with that of states without RTW laws. Moreover, this tendency is more pronounced for blue‐collar and low‐wage workers who start unincorporated businesses. These findings offer novel insights on the relationship between anti‐labor environments and necessity‐driven entrepreneurship by focusing on individual‐level incentives in non‐knowledge‐intensive sectors.Managerial SummaryChanges in employment conditions influence employees to consider starting their own businesses, yet our understanding of how these changes drive individuals toward entrepreneurship remains limited. This study explores how weakened labor union power affects workers' engagement in entrepreneurial activities, with a focus on the types of employees impacted and the businesses that they start. By examining the adoption of RTW laws in Michigan and Indiana, we find that weakened labor union power disproportionately affects blue‐collar and low‐wage workers, increasing their likelihood of starting unincorporated businesses. These results suggest that managers and policymakers should consider the challenges faced by these workers and how changes in employment conditions may shape their career choices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines CEO pay at nonprofits. Using compensation data for 14,111 nonprofits, we find that CEO pay dropped by 2% after legislation in New York reduced CEOs’ ability to influence their own pay. Despite lower pay, CEOs exerted more effort, and nonprofit performance improved. The effects were stronger at commercial nonprofits than at charities and for male CEOs than female CEOs. These findings are consistent with a model where some nonprofit CEOs derive meaning from their work and compensation can be rigged. Overall, our results suggest that regulation that targets the pay-setting process can improve organizational outcomes at nonprofits. (JEL G30, G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stocks expected to be sold by distressed mega hedge funds (MHFs) face anticipatory institutional selling and increased short interest. However, no evidence of anticipatory trading is found in stocks held by nondistressed MHFs, distressed non-MHFs, or stocks confidentially held by distressed MHFs, suggesting that public portfolio disclosure by large and closely followed distressed investors, and not common investment signals, drives anticipatory trading. Distressed MHFs with greater exposure to such anticipatory trading suffer 2.21% lower style-adjusted returns. Stocks subject to anticipatory trading experience negative abnormal returns followed by reversals, indicating the price destabilizing effect of anticipatory trading. (JEL G12, G20, G23)</content>

    <title>What Do Policies Value?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a policy prioritizes one person over another, is it because they benefit more, or because they are preferred? This paper develops a method to uncover the values consistent with observed allocation decisions. We estimate how much each individual benefits from an intervention, and then reconcile the allocation with (i) the welfare weights assigned to different people; (ii) heterogeneous treatment edects of the intervention; and (iii) weights on different outcomes. We demonstrate this approach by analyzing Mexico’s PROGRESA anti-poverty program. The analysis reveals that while the program prioritized certain subgroups — such as indigenous households — the fact that those groups benefited more implies that the program did not actually assign them a higher welfare weight. We also find evidence that the policy valued outcomes differently from households. The PROGRESA case illustrates how the method makes it possible to audit existing policies, and to design future policies that better align with values.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent studies suggest monitoring increases during economic downturns. In this study, we test whether firms’ abnormal investment activity changes across the business cycle. Focusing on recessions, we find that firms not only curtail overinvestment but also reduce underinvestment, with the combined effect representing a significant 9% of average investment. Employing various proxies for monitoring intensity, we demonstrate that stronger governance mechanisms are associated with more pronounced reductions in abnormal investment. Importantly, the influence of governance on abnormal investment is magnified during recessions relative to other periods. These results are robust to a wide array of control variables, methodologies, and potential endogeneity concerns. Our findings underscore the time-varying benefits of corporate monitoring and highlight the periods when governance mechanisms may be most effective.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04350 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess the long‐term effects of managerial stress on aging and mortality. Using a difference‐in‐differences design, we apply neural network–based machine‐learning techniques to CEOs' facial images and show that exposure to industry distress shocks during the Great Recession produces visible signs of aging. We estimate a one‐year increase in “apparent” age. Moreover, using data on CEOs since the mid‐1970s, we estimate a 1.1‐year decrease in life expectancy after an industry distress shock, but a two‐year increase when antitakeover laws insulate CEOs from market discipline. The estimated health costs are significant, both in absolute terms and relative to other health risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Young firms' contribution to aggregate employment has been underwhelming. We show that a similar trend is not apparent, however, in their contribution to aggregate sales or stock market capitalization, implying that these firms have exhibited a high average‐to‐marginal revenue product of labor. We study the implications of a gradual shift in the average‐to‐marginal revenue product of labor within a model of dynamic firm heterogeneity. We show that this shift provides (i) a unified explanation for several aspects of the decline in dynamism and (ii) a possible explanation for why large declines in young‐firm employment may have only a moderate effect on aggregate output and consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that incorporating defined benefit pension funds in an incomplete markets asset pricing model improves its ability to match the historical equity premium and riskless rate and has important risk‐sharing implications. We document the importance of the pension fund's size and asset demands, and a new risk channel arising from fluctuations in the fund's returns. We use our calibrated model to study the implications of a shift to an economy with defined contribution plans. The new steady state is characterized by a higher riskless rate and a lower equity premium. Consumption volatility increases for retirees but decreases for workers.</content>

    <title>Beyond Pairwise Network Interactions: Implications for Information Centrality</title>

    <author>
      <name>Sandro Claudio Lera, Yan Leng</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations and policymakers increasingly rely on network metrics to decide whom to inform, monitor, or support. Yet most networks treat interactions as pairs, even when the underlying activity occurs in groups—project teams, chat channels, meetings, or news articles that mention multiple firms. Collapsing groups into one-to-one links can misidentify who matters. We propose a practical alternative: Model group interactions directly as a hypergraph and compute centrality from a two-step diffusion process that captures how information moves across and within groups. The approach provides a transparent way to incorporate domain knowledge (e.g., whether people enter large or small groups first) and produces testable interpretable rankings. We evaluate the method in three settings—open-source software, a high school interaction study, and financial comentions—and find that hypergraph-based, theory-informed centrality better explains outcomes such as project success, student popularity, and same-day returns than standard graph centralities. For practice and policy, this yields more effective targeting, earlier warning signals, and improved allocation of attention and resources in collaborative work, public health, and market surveillance. We release an open-source Python package (HyperCentral) to support adoption.</content>

    <title>Tight, Loose, or Denied Holding: How Interpersonal Holding Shapes Innovators’ Responses to Innovation Obstacles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovating at work often requires persistence through distressing obstacles and failures. When innovators experience such distress, they may engage colleagues for interpersonal holding—a process in which the colleague (i.e., “holder”) helps contain the innovator’s distress and provides new ways of understanding the obstacle that incited that distress. Prior research has made great strides in explaining what holding processes share in common across different individuals and in different contexts. However, through an inductive study based on 91 semistructured interviews with 74 innovators in a large hospital system, we find significant variation in the dynamics of interpersonal holding. Our analysis uncovered three distinct “interpersonal holding trajectories”—tight holding, loose holding, and denied holding trajectories. At the heart of these trajectories are distinct interpersonal holding episodes. Each episode varies by how holders engage with the innovators’ distress and the obstacles that caused the distress. These distinct episodes uniquely reinforced (or not) our informants’ innovator identities, ultimately influencing divergent responses to the obstacles that they faced. By building theory from the perspective of those who seek holding, our findings highlight important divergences in how interpersonal holding may unfold and identify important implications for innovators and their organizations.Funding: This work was supported by Globoforce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new model of monetary policy implementation to account for two key developments: (i) the introduction of intraday liquidity requirements and (ii) the decreasing relevance of the federal funds market in favor of repurchase agreement (repo) markets with nonbank participants. Our paper studies how liquidity requirements prevent banks from arbitraging between the fed funds and repo markets and generate large repo spikes. We propose a simple measure of excess intraday reserves. Consistent with our theory, this metric is close to zero in 2019Q2, when U.S. repo markets experienced a spike of 400 basis points.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04037 .</content>

    <title>Overcoming Deceptive Evasions in Earnings Calls: The Role of Investor Suspicion</title>
    <updated>2025-10-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Leonardo P. Barcellos</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Evasive responses enable managers to escape difficult questions in earnings calls without lying. Although such tactics are common in corporate communication and other important settings, we still know little about how investors and other listeners can avoid being misled by them. Drawing on theories from multiple disciplines, I predict that a common type of nonanswer leads to equivocal interpretations, whereas artful dodges escape detection in earnings calls. However, when investors adopt a suspicious state of mind—characterized by suspended judgment, balanced information search, and consideration of plausible rival possibilities—they are better able to distinguish potentially deceptive evasive tactics from proper responses. My experimental results support these predictions, showing that suspicious thinking allows investors to overcome nonanswers and dodges without punishing adequate responses. I also provide evidence that nonanswers and dodges are unique evasive strategies and that simple interventions aligned with the context of earnings calls can prompt suspicion. These findings contribute to research on the informational role of earnings calls and offer new insights into how suspicion influences deception judgments and into previous research on evasive responses in earnings calls.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The author acknowledges financial support from the Deloitte Foundation, the Roberto C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first comprehensive analysis of directors’ shareholderism: their principled stance toward shareholders and stakeholders in forming strategy. We develop an analytical framework that links shareholderism to individual and institutional factors and test our theoretical predictions using a sample of more than 900 directors originating from 55 countries and serving in 23 countries. Directors’ shareholderism varies according to their individual values; their cultural heritage of egalitarianism, harmony, and embeddedness; and their status as expatriate directors. Directors’ shareholderism does not appear to depend on the distinction between common and civil law. Instrumental variable regressions that address the endogeneity of directors’ expatriate status suggest that expatriates’ and local directors’ shareholderism reflect different cultural emphases. To be effective, current approaches to ensuring corporations do the “right” thing through legal injunctions may need to be mindful of the stability and resilience of individual values and culture.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, business strategy.Funding: A.

    <title>Painful Prices: The Moral Harm Model of Price Fairness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ responses to seller’s prices, including perceptions of price fairness (PPF) and unfairness, are a crucial aspect of the marketplace. Although past literature has uncovered a variety of factors that influence PPF, the lack of an overarching conceptual framework has constrained understanding of when and why consumers are more likely to perceive prices as fair or unfair. The authors develop a conceptual model of PPF as moral judgments and propose that these moral PPF arise from consumer inferences of potential harm from a price. The conceptualization suggests that inferred harm—and thereby, PPF—is influenced by consumer vulnerability, product welfare impact and firm price strategy (e.g., costs and prices, differential pricing, and price promotions). The authors also propose that consumer political orientation and inferred firm self-defense motives moderate the relationship between inferred harm and PPF and that inferred firm motives for prices influence PPF. Eight studies test this conceptualization. The results support the moral harm model and provide novel insights, showing when unchanged prices, price increases, and price decreases are likely to be perceived as more unfair and when differential prices (including paying more than others) are likely to be perceived as fairer than equal prices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds have heterogeneous incentives to engage with portfolio firms. If funds view ESG as a value driver, then these incentives will affect funds’ behavior and thus their impact on firms. We compare ESG funds with similar levels of ESG investments but different incentives to engage. Funds with higher incentives to engage, that is, committed ESG funds, conduct more ESG-related information acquisition, pursue longer term investment strategies, engage more intensely on ESG issues, and have greater real impacts. Moreover, committed ESG funds have outperformed other ESG funds within subportfolios with higher and more effective ESG engagement.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reducing Hospital Procurement Costs through Vendor Contract Optimization: A Decision-Support Framework for GPOs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) play a crucial intermediary role in the U.S. healthcare supply chain by consolidating purchasing power across multiple healthcare providers. However, increasing competition from peer organizations and hospitals’ insourcing efforts has placed significant pressure on GPOs to enhance their value propositions. This study presents a data-driven framework designed to help GPOs reduce medical supply costs for hospitals by addressing inefficiencies in vendor tier contracts, a complex form of quantity discount based on market share rather than absolute quantity. The framework consists of reference matrices that define feasible adjustment spaces for tier prices and thresholds, followed by mixed-integer programming models designed to optimize contract parameters. It enables GPOs to (1) identify misalignments between vendor contracts and hospital operational realities, (2) guide vendors in improving their tier contracts to lower procurement costs for hospitals while supporting their own financial interests, and (3) evaluate the potential for tailoring contracts to individual health systems within existing tier structures to achieve additional savings. Applied to four health systems within a Midwest-based GPO, the model demonstrates up to 50% potential savings compared to current IDN spend and 14% savings relative to the optimal spend under existing tier thresholds. In addition, while prior studies suggest hospital-direct contracts fail to deliver net savings due to high transaction costs, our research shows that some hospitals could potentially benefit from GPO-managed custom contracts.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Bonus Competition in the Gig Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of a gig platform is crucially driven by its ability to compete for labor supply. However, gig workers are independent contractors whose working schedules are not fully controlled by the platform. To overcome this challenge, gig platforms have commonly relied on bonus strategies to drive the participation of gig workers. We study the impact of bonus strategies on gig platforms and their welfare implications. We consider two types of bonus strategies used by gig platforms: 1) fixed bonus that is paid in addition to commissions as long as a service provider participates, and 2) contingent bonus that is paid only if a service provider participates consistently over time. We develop a game theory model to study platform competition with bonus strategies. Our analysis shows that the two types of bonuses will arise in equilibrium under different market conditions. First, when labor supply is thick, fixed bonus will be offered. In this case, fixed bonus improves platform profit by eliminating a prisoner’s dilemma that arises when the platforms compete only on commissions. However, social welfare will be reduced because the utilization of the labor supply is reduced due to the softened platform competition. Second, when labor supply is thin, contingent bonus will be offered. In this case, contingent bonus reduces platform profit because it intensifies platform competition and traps the platforms in a prisoner’s dilemma where they are forced to offer too much bonus. It further causes inefficiency in matching labor supply with demand and hence reduces social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly powerful, but with that power comes greater complexity and opacity. As these models become more sophisticated, they become increasingly difficult to understand—and, crucially, harder to anticipate when and how they might fail. This makes it essential to incorporate their predictions in ways that remain robust to errors. In “Single-Leg Revenue Management with Advice,” S. Balseiro, C. Kroer, and R. Kumar develop an algorithm for the classical single-leg revenue management problem that robustly incorporates predictions. They uncover a fundamental tradeoff: Placing greater trust in predictive models can yield high performance when predictions are accurate but also makes algorithms vulnerable when predictions are off. The proposed algorithm achieves the optimal tradeoff between these goals, allowing decision makers to leverage machine learning predictions while guarding against their potential inaccuracies. By doing so, this work provides a principled approach to integrating powerful yet imperfect forecasts into real-world decision making.</content>

    <title>Residential Battery Storage—Reshaping the Way We Do Electricity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Household investments in renewable energy technologies like rooftop solar and battery storage can be driven by motivations beyond mere financial returns. In “Residential Battery Storage— Reshaping the Way We Do Electricity,” Christian Kaps and Serguei Netessine develop a structural estimation model that separates observed electricity demand from underlying consumption preferences, enabling the estimation of a nonfinancial utility that households derive from using more self-generated solar power rather than grid-procured electricity. The authors call this utility nonmarket valuation; provide evidence that it is driven by sustainability and autarky desires; and link it to the early adoption of residential storage. Applying their model to a novel data set of German households with solar and storage installations, they find that the median household has a nonmarket valuation of 0.29 euros per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that residential storage can have unexpected effects. They show a “rebound effect,” whereby households with storage increase their overall electricity consumption by 4%. Counterintuitively, under Germany’s observed grid mix, residential storage on average increases carbon emissions. However, they also find that demand from the grid decreases by 38% for the average household equipped with solar and storage.</content>

    <title>The Role of Networks in Loan Syndicate Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Several large, well-connected banks jointly underwrite the vast majority of syndicated loans. Although syndication reduces risk by spreading large loans across multiple banks and may benefit borrowers, the process may also facilitate collusive pricing. Disentangling these two effects requires a network view of loan syndicates as traditional measures of market concentration do not capture the collaborative nature of syndication. We find that well-connected banks offer 5- to 15-basis-point-lower loan rates. Well-connected lenders leverage their network position to structure larger, more dispersed syndicates with fewer coarrangers, allowing them to earn higher fee income and reduce their loan risk exposure. We address potential selection biases by exploiting the stickiness in firm-bank relationships and the transfer of credit relationships around forced mergers during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. Using new supervisory data on borrowers’ loan repayment and on-site inspections, we find little evidence that connectedness is related to superior monitoring or performance. Our findings suggest that connectivity is instrumental in lowering loan prices rather than facilitating collusive pricing.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06313 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions on Marketing Decisions and Effectiveness: Evidence from the Biopharma Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) may trigger adjustments to firms’ marketing decisions and their outcomes. Yet, prior literature provides little empirical insight regarding the nature of these adjustments. We address this gap in the context of the biopharma industry, analyzing data on sales, prices, and detailing spending for 375 branded drugs acquired in 73 M&amp;A deals between 2007 and 2020. We find that, on average, acquiring firms (1) reduce detailing spending on target drugs, (2) increase target drug prices, and (3) achieve increases in detailing elasticity for target drugs after the M&amp;A, compared to before. The younger the target drugs and the more experience the acquirer has in marketing drugs in the drugs’ therapeutic category, (1) the more likely we are to see reductions in detailing and increases in prices, and (2) the greater the likelihood that acquirers experience larger increases in detailing elasticity and reductions in price elasticity. For our 375 target drugs, acquirers generated over $23 billion more in revenue in the two post-deal years while spending over $1 billion less on detailing compared to the two pre-deal years. The paper provides a framework for firms regarding commercial returns on M&amp;As and informs the debate on regulatory responses to M&amp;As.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers make individual decisions for their own, others’, and joint consumption. This research introduces a framework for understanding the process of making individual decisions for joint consumption by comparing them to individual decisions for the self and for others (e.g., gifts). Seven experiments show that individual decisions for joint consumption, which involve considering one’s own and others’ preferences, consistently increase felt responsibility for unsatisfactory outcomes and decrease confidence in ability to make satisfactory choices compared to decisions for the self. Knowledge of others’ preferences plays a critical role in differentiating between individual decisions for joint versus others’ consumption; (in)congruent preferences (decrease) increase confidence in decisions for joint consumption, while any knowledge of others’ preferences – regardless of congruity – increases confidence in decisions for others. Three managerially-relevant downstream consequences are identified that differ among individual decisions for joint, self, and others’ consumption: decision anxiety, choice of assortment options, and choice of popular options. These insights offer valuable strategies for marketers to tailor their product offerings and communications to consumers engaged in individual decisions for joint, own, or others’ consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The evolution of innovation ecosystems hinges on the effective coordination between ecosystem leaders and complementors. While ecosystem-sponsored architectural innovations create new technological opportunities for complementors, they may unintentionally disrupt the performance of complementor products that were originally developed based on legacy architectural designs. This study provides empirical evidence of these disruptive effects and explores how complementors’ alignment with the ecosystem leader mitigates such challenges. Focusing on Apple’s release of Core ML—a proprietary artificial intelligence module—in its mobile ecosystem, we employ a difference-in-differences design to investigate variations in complementor performance after adopting this ecosystem-sponsored architectural innovation. Our findings reveal that complementors’ technological and flow alignment with the ecosystem leader is critical for minimizing performance disruptions and enhancing value creation during ecosystem evolution. This study enriches our understanding of architectural changes and complementor heterogeneity in innovation ecosystems.</content>

    <title>Brand Faith: How Spiritual Relationships Develop Between Consumers and Brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers increasingly seek spiritual satisfaction and existential meaning through brands. However, despite the rising prominence of secular forms of spirituality, consumer-brand relationship research largely overlooks the processes by which consumers initiate, develop, and maintain spiritual connections to brands. Using the concept of faith as a theoretical lens, this paper explores how consumer-brand relationships take on spiritual dimensions. Drawing on an interpretive biographic analysis of in-depth interviews and netnographic data, the authors examine spiritual relationship development processes as they unfold between consumers and brands over time. Findings identify five phases of brand faith development (intuition, association, reflection, affirmation, universalization), which progress from initial attraction to deep conviction. Consumers cultivate faith in brands across these phases through a process of believing in, valuing, and committing to a brand as a sacred entity that acts as a center of spiritual meaning. These findings offer a more nuanced understanding of spiritual relationships between consumers and secular brands than current literature provides. The analysis also examines factors that facilitate or inhibit brand faith development, contributing a contextual understanding of brand faith that accounts for influences arising from an interplay between personal, brand, and marketplace factors that affect consumer spirituality.</content>

    <title>Do We Think Differently When Tapping the Screen or Clicking the Mouse? Effects of Computer Interfaces on Level of Construal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The touchscreen has become the de facto interface for individuals to interact with digital devices. This research investigates the implications of the profound shift from the mouse-based, nontouch interface to the touch-based interface for human thinking and behavior. Ten studies reveal that using touchscreens, as opposed to a mouse, fosters a more concrete low-level construal. Specifically, using touch interfaces on devices such as iPads and tablets prompts people to interpret actions in a detailed, hands-on manner, viewing locking a door as inserting a key into a lock rather than as a broader concept such as securing a house. Touchscreens also encourage a narrow categorization of concepts and a reliance on local, granular attributes. The concrete mindset evoked by the touch interface elevates individuals’ preference for practicality over complexity, such as choosing a compact camera over an advanced one, and receptiveness to persuasive attempts with feasibility appeals. Given that mental construals fundamentally influence how we perceive and engage with the world, our findings underscore the wide-ranging impacts of touch interfaces. This research provides a theoretical foundation for exploring the broader implications of the widespread adoption of touch technology, especially as digital devices become increasingly integrated into our digitally transformed daily life worldwide.</content>

    <title>The Surrogate Index: Combining Short-Term Proxies to Estimate Long-Term Treatment Effects more Rapidly and Precisely</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common challenge in estimating the impact of interventions (e.g., job training programs, educational programs) is that many outcomes of interest (e.g., lifetime earnings or other labor market outcomes) are observed with a long delay. In biomedical settings this is often addressed by using short-term outcomes as so-called “surrogates” for the outcome of interest, e.g., tumor size as a surrogate for mortality in cancer studies. We build on this literature by combining multiple, possibly qualitatively distinct, short-term outcomes (e.g., short-run earnings and employment indicators) systematically into a “surrogate index.” Under the Prentice surrogacy assumption, which requires that the primary outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogates, we show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome. We also relate the surrogacy assumption to a set of structural, causal assumptions. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of each of the key assumptions, and we provide simple methods to validate these assumptions using additional observed outcomes. We apply our method to analyze the long-term impacts of a multi-site job training experiment in California. Rather than waiting a full nine years to directly observe the long-term impact, we show that it is possible to use short-term (the first six quarters) outcomes as surrogates. One could have estimated the program’s long-term impacts on mean employment rates using the employment rates observed in the first six quarters, with a 35% reduction in standard errors.</content>

    <title>Reskilling the Workforce for AI: Domain Expertise and Algorithmic Literacy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides evidence that AI and algorithms act as complements to domain expertise, creating the greatest value when algorithmic literacy is broadly diffused among workers. Unlike earlier business technologies that concentrated expertise in IT specialists, AI and algorithms are most effective when domain experts themselves can interpret and apply them. Using two workforce datasets, I show that demand for algorithmic skills is rising among domain experts, frontier firms diffuse these skills broadly, and markets reward firms’ AI and algorithmic investments more when such capabilities are dispersed. The spread of no-code and natural language tools accelerates this shift by lowering barriers to use and allowing domain experts to integrate algorithms into their decision-making processes. These patterns underscore the importance of workforce training and organizational design in realizing productivity gains from AI adoption.This paper has been accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than $60 billion per year in the United States is spent on policies aimed to increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption among low-income households. Many of these policy interventions are either monetary (e.g., financial incentives) or education related. The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of these interventions through a more strategic and personalized allocation of funds. This paper introduces a consumer behavioral model for grocery shopping decisions, which is nested into the policymaker’s upper-level optimization problem. The policymaker’s goal is to ensure that the FV spending of all consumers in a given population exceeds a specified threshold by utilizing a small strategic set of different intervention bundles—combinations of monetary and education-related interventions. Although an exact solution to the upper-level problem is intractable, we provide an analytical upper bound on the number of intervention bundles needed to achieve the policymaker’s goal, as well as a method for constructing these intervention bundles and assigning them to individuals based on their characteristics. We demonstrate the practicality of the model and approach using the low-income households in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s FoodAPS data set.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, management science.Funding: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under [Grant 1745302].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02324 .</content>

    <title>Long Goodbyes: How Do Private Equity Funds Manage Sell-Downs After Initial Public Offerings?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how private equity funds (general partners (GPs)) sell down their stakes in companies they take public. GPs earn private equity management fees and carried interest on public equity holdings. The average duration of post–initial public offering (IPO) holdings is three years, whereas lockups expire after six months. Private equity–backed IPOs perform well during the lockup, but we find no evidence that GPs add value for investors through the timing of their aftermarket sell-down strategies. GPs appear reluctant to sell losers, consistent with behavioral biases and agency effects. Long goodbyes are more likely when the fund is performing better, resulting in higher payments to GPs.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivanisha, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02043 .</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence as an Organizing Capability Arising from Human‐Algorithm Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we move beyond the prevailing view of artificial intelligence (AI) as an independent entity within organizations, which, we argue, risks obscuring potential explanations of the effects of AI on organizing. Drawing on posthumanism, we propose an ontological shift in conceptualizing AI. We theorize that, instead of residing within algorithmic actors, AI arises from the relations among human and algorithmic actors as an organizing capability. This capability is characterized by connectivity, codependence, and emergence as core properties, and contributes to organizational analysing, learning, and acting in pursuit of organizational goals. The shift from the entity view to the organizing capability view of AI has significant implications for understanding its organizational effects and opens new avenues for research in human‐algorithm collaboration, algorithmic management, and organizational intelligence, while counterbalancing tendencies to treat AI as autonomous agents.</content>

    <title>Anomalies and Their Short‐Sale Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Short‐sale costs eliminate the abnormal returns on asset pricing anomaly portfolios. While many anomalies persist out‐of‐sample before accounting for short‐sale costs, they cannot be exploited with long‐short strategies due to stock borrow fees. Using a comprehensive sample of 162 anomalies, the average long‐short portfolio return is a significant 0.14% per month before short‐sale costs, and the returns are due to the short leg. However, the average is −0.01% once returns are adjusted for borrow fees. Moreover, anomalies are not profitable even before fees if the high‐fee observations, representing 12% of stock dates, are excluded from the analysis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the expected consequences of negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news on firms' future profits. After learning about negative ESG news, analysts significantly downgrade their forecasts at short and longer horizons. Negative ESG news affects forecasts more strongly at longer horizons than other types of negative corporate news. The negative revisions of earnings forecasts following negative ESG news largely reflect expectations of lower future sales, rather than higher future costs. Quantitatively, forecast revisions can explain most of the negative impacts of ESG news on firm value. Analysts are correct to revise forecasts downward following negative ESG news.</content>

    <title>Macroeconomic Information Acquisition Around Earnings Clusters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows that investors acquire and process less firm‐specific information on days when many firms announce earnings (hereafter earnings clusters). We show that investors gather moremacroeconomicinformation during earnings clusters, that this behavior is amplified during negative economic shocks and concurrent macroeconomic announcements, and that these information acquisition patterns have implications for equity valuations. Our findings are consistent with the benefit of extracting macroeconomic information from earnings announcements increasing during earnings clusters, which we confirm empirically. Thus, our results help explain why investors focus less on individual firm news during earnings clusters: They rationally redirect their attention to the most beneficial information.</content>

    <title>Corporate Litigation, Governance, and the Role of Law Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study plaintiff law firms in corporate litigation, focusing on “star” firms that dominate settlement outcomes. Stars are associated with larger settlements; however, much of this effect is predicted by the defendant's litigation insurance coverage, suggesting assortative matching of stars with lawsuits that have ex ante larger expected payoffs. Moreover, stars charge higher fees for a given settlement size. Additional tests suggest that visibility and information asymmetry vis‐à‐vis less sophisticated plaintiffs help sustain the stars’ market share. These findings advance our understanding of corporate litigation and the agency relationship between plaintiff law firms and their clients.</content>
