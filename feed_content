    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine political affiliation's role in venture team formation and success. Using data from Crunchbase and L2 on 1125 US‐based startups, we investigate political homophily in team assembly and its association with startup outcomes. Our analysis reveals strong political homogeneity in founding teams: teams with similar political views form more frequently than diverse teams, even after controlling for founders' gender, age, location, and industry. This political homophily relates to venture performance. Startups with politically heterogeneous founding teams are more likely to shut down. Across additional performance measures (capital funding, employee size, Crunchbase rankings), we observe directionally consistent associations with worse outcomes, though these secondary findings vary in robustness. These findings highlight the dual role of founders' political affiliations: their relationship with team composition and startup performance.Managerial SummaryOur study examines political diversity's association with startup team formation and venture success. Analyzing data from 1125 US‐based startups, we discovered a strong tendency for teams to form based on political similarity. Individuals with similar political views prefer starting companies together, even when accounting for age, gender, location, and industry. Startups with politically diverse founding teams are more likely to shut down. These teams also tend to receive less funding, have fewer employees, and exhibit worse Crunchbase rankings, although these patterns are less consistent than the survival effect. For entrepreneurs and investors, these findings highlight the need to balance team cohesion against diverse perspectives. Business practitioners should be aware of these dynamics when forming teams or developing management strategies, particularly in a politically charged environment.</content>

    <title>Marginal Returns to Public Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the returns to enrolling in American public universities by comparing the long-term outcomes of barely admitted versus barely rejected applicants. I use administrative admission records spanning all 35 public universities in Texas, which collectively enroll 10 percent of all American public university students, to systematically identify and employ decentralized cutoffs in SAT/ACT scores that generate discontinuities in admission and enrollment. The typical marginally admitted student gains an additional year of education in the four-year sector, becomes 12 percentage points more likely to ever earn a bachelor’s degree, and eventually earns 8 percent more than their marginally rejected but otherwise identical counterpart. Marginally admitted students pay no additional tuition costs thanks to offsetting grant aid; cost-benefit calculations show internal rates of return of 26 percent for the marginal students themselves, 16 percent for society (which must pay for the additional education), and 7 percent for the government budget. Earnings gains are similar across admitting institutions of varying selectivity, but smaller for students from low-income families, who spend more time enrolled but complete fewer degrees and major in less lucrative fields. Finally, I develop a method to separately identify effects for students on the extensive margin of attending any university versus those on the margin of attending a more selective one, revealing larger effects on the extensive margin.</content>

    <title>Who’s Afraid of the Minimum Wage? Measuring the Impacts on Independent Businesses Using Matched U.S. Tax Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common concern surrounding minimum wage policies is their impact on independent businesses, which are often feared to be less able to bear or pass on cost increases. We examine how these typically small- and medium-size firms accommodate minimum wage increases along product and labor market margins using a matched owner-firm-worker panel dataset drawn from the universe of U.S. tax records over a 10-year period, and using state minimum wage changes as identifying variation. We find that, on average, firms in highly exposed industries do not substantially reduce employment — they do not layoff workers but moderately reduce part-time hiring. Instead, these firms are able to fully finance the new labor costs with new revenues, leaving average owner profits unchanged. Higher wage floors, however, forestall entry, particularly of less productive firms, reducing the number of independent firms operating in these industries by roughly 2%. Yet, these industries do not shrink; instead, incumbent responses and strong positive selection among entrants reshape industries that rely heavily on low-wage workers, yielding fewer but more productive firms after the cost shock. We also take a worker-level perspective to examine how potentially vulnerable individuals are affected by minimum wage increases. Using panels of low-earning and young workers, we find that their average earnings rise substantially with the minimum wage, while they are no less likely to be employed. Worker transitions indicate that minimum wage increases boost retention and that worker reallocation from independent firms toward corporations buffers disemployment impacts from reduced hiring at independent firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rethinking Causal Inference Through Robust Sensitivity ModelsIn this issue, a new study by researchers from The Wharton School and New York University introduces a breakthrough in causal inference for observational data. Traditional analyses often fail when hidden confounders distort cause-and-effect relationships, but the newly proposed f-sensitivity model tackles this challenge by measuring the “average” impact of unobserved confounding instead of its worst-case effect. This framework connects causal inference to distributionally robust optimization, providing more realistic and interpretable bounds on treatment effects. With novel estimation and debiasing techniques, the method achieves statistical validity, even under minimal assumptions. The approach offers a flexible, computationally efficient way to test how robust conclusions remain in the presence of uncertainty, marking a significant advance in data-driven decision making across economics, healthcare, and policy analysis.</content>

    <title>Public Signals, Default Risk, and Voluntary Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the information in public signals (e.g., earnings, analysts’ forecasts) affects firms’ voluntary disclosures. We consider levered firms and information structures such that investors update their beliefs about both the mean and variance of the firm’s cash flows. We predict that firms that, conditional on the public signal, have a higher default risk are less likely to disclose. For firms with low ex ante default risk, larger positive surprises following the public signal initially increase the disclosure likelihood because they indicate a higher mean of cash flows. However, too large positive surprises may reduce the disclosure likelihood of these firms, because the larger surprise is also indicative of higher variance and, thus, higher probability of default. Symmetrically, larger negative surprises may increase disclosure for firms with high ex ante default risk, despite the more pessimistic inference about the mean, because the higher variance makes it more likely that these firms avoid default. Extending our analysis to multiple analysts’ forecasts, we predict that not only consensus, but also dispersion affect firms’ disclosure likelihood. Consensus conveys information about the mean and variance of cash flows, whereas dispersion is informative about the precision of analysts’ signals, which in turn affects the information content of forecasts.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: D.

    <title>Commercializing the Package Flow: Cross-Sampling Physical Products Through E-Commerce Warehouses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many e-commerce platforms have established their warehouses to facilitate the storage and delivery of packages. This paper studies a novel business practice—cross-sampling through e-commerce warehouses—that allows physical free samples provided by one (sampling) brand to be distributed with the packages of another unrelated (distributing) brand. In close collaboration with Alibaba, we implement cross-sampling through a large-scale field experiment, in which more than 55,000 free samples are distributed, to empirically examine its effectiveness in driving online sales of the sampling brand. First, we find significant increases in store visits and sales of the sampling brand both in the short term and long term up to 14 months afterward. The long-term effect is driven mainly by acquiring customers who did not purchase from the sampling brand to visit the online stores and eventually make a purchase. Second, contrary to the previous literature on within-category free sampling, we find a significant sales increase in both the sampled item and other items, which further spills over to indirect channels. Therefore, cross-sampling can also help promote the sampling brand as a whole. Finally, we illustrate the potential for personalization for cross-sampling. Cross-sampling is more effective for customers who recently viewed related products or just purchased nonessential products from the distributing brand. By taking into account the interaction among brands, items, and customers, we can further improve the profitability of cross-sampling by targeting the “right” packages. Overall, because cross-sampling is scalable, effective, and flexible, we demonstrate the high potential of a new business practice that combines offline logistics control and online information to generate additional business value for customers, brands, and the platform.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Funding: T.

    <title>How the Threat of Knowledge Loss Drives Firms’ R&amp;amp;D Dynamism: A Threat Rigidity Perspective</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on threat rigidity theory, this paper argues that the threat of knowledge loss gives rise to a threat rigidity effect in firms’ R&amp;D function, that is, reduces their R&amp;D dynamism. It further argues that the dampening of R&amp;D dynamism is greater for firms more vulnerable to the threat of knowledge loss due to facing greater product market competition, yet lower for firms that can better respond to the threat due to having relatively higher absorptive capacity and/or greater financial slack. Using a sample of publicly listed US manufacturing firms tracked over a 15‐year observation period from 1991 to 2015 and leveraging the quasi‐natural experiment created by the staggered rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) across fourteen US states, it empirically tests and finds support for the above hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Inventor Rewards, Specialization, and Innovation Performance</title>
    <updated>2025-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inventor rewards—monetary compensation for employees who generate patents—are widely used to promote innovation. Yet the same incentives can steer innovation toward productivity (quantity) or toward inventiveness (quality). Based on social identity theorizing, we argue that inventors’ social identity order—lower versus higher—explains this heterogeneity. Lower-order identities, exemplified by technological specialists, are tightly constructed around exclusive, proximal membership with actively policed expectations—such as strict inventiveness norms—whereas higher-order identities, exemplified by generalists, are more distal and loosely policed, providing limited social constraints on behavior. Rewards activate identity, and the desire for incentive-identity alignment then guides behavior, with stronger pressures to conform to ingroup standards under lower-order than higher-order identities. Hence, we predict that, in response to inventor rewards, specialists produce fewer but more-inventive patents whereas generalists increase productivity at the expense of inventiveness, defaulting to prototypical reward-maximizing behavior. Further, in mixed-identity teams, specialists’ norms are projected onto generalists, raising their inventiveness in response to inventor rewards. We test these predictions using a difference-in-differences estimation and matched inventor-patent data from before and after a regulatory change in China mandating inventor rewards in state-owned enterprises. Consistent with our theory, after the mandate, generalists filed more but less-inventive patents, specialists produced fewer but more-inventive patents, and generalists in mixed teams became more inventive. By linking social identity order to reward responses, we clarify how to align incentives and the R&amp;D workforce with desired innovation outcomes.</content>

    <title>Changing beliefs or changing behavior? Understanding the belief‐to‐behavior process and intervening to curb the impact of misinformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common assumption among scientists, journalists, and policymakers is that combating misinformation reliably changes behavior. However, the empirical evidence reveals that the belief–behavior association is often modest, variable, and context‐dependent, raising critical questions about when and how to pursue belief versus behavior change. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms by which beliefs influence behavior and the conditions under which addressing beliefs can change behavior. Specifically, we review the belief‐to‐behavior inference model, which proposes that beliefs influence behavior when (a) the belief is linked to a behavioral goal, (b) the inferential path from belief to behavior is relatively short, and (c) the belief–behavior association is preserved in memory. Our framework aligns intervention decisions with the cognitive architecture of belief–behavior correspondence and the intervention's goals, whether maximizing belief accuracy or behavioral impact. We also reviewed individual and social‐structural interventions that are best suited for changing beliefs versus behavior, conceptually integrating interdisciplinary work on behavior change with the psychology of belief change.</content>

    <title>The Effects of the FTC Policy and Affiliation Disclosures on Product Review Video Engagement: Evidence from YouTube</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractAffiliate marketing on social media involves content creators posting product reviews with affiliate links, through which they earn a commission from resulting purchases. The FTC’s disclosure guidelines require creators to reveal affiliate relationships alongside product reviews. This paper examines how the FTC policy affects viewer engagement with affiliated content, defined as product review videos containing affiliate links. We find that after the FTC policy implementation, viewer engagement with affiliated content significantly decreases relative to nonaffiliated content. However, affiliation disclosure moderates this effect: after the policy, affiliated content with disclosures receives higher engagement than affiliated content without disclosures. The mitigating effect of disclosures varies across content creator and video characteristics. The mitigating effect is more pronounced for more experienced creators, more popular creators, and more negative videos. This paper provides important empirical evidence on disclosure policies’ effects on viewer engagement, addressing a notable gap in the literature. Our findings also have important implications for policymakers designing effective disclosure regulations, content creators managing compliance while maintaining viewer engagement, and social media platforms implementing disclosure features. This paper finds that whereas disclosure policies may lower engagement with affiliated content, proper disclosures can signal credibility and increase engagement.</content>

    <title>Expanding Our Understanding of Quiet Quitting: Antecedents, Correlates, and Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting remains an undertheorized and inconsistently defined construct in the scholarly literature. There is little understanding of or agreement about its construct domain, and no unifying conceptual framework to distinguish it from related constructs. Popular accounts often equate quiet quitting with employee work disengagement. Drawing on a synthesis of academic and practitioner literatures, we conceptualized quiet quitting as a form of psychological withdrawal that extends beyond in‐role task disengagement to include disengagement from colleagues and the organization more broadly. Its key components include a weakening of social connections at work, diminishing job engagement, a generalized disinclination toward work, and the desire to set boundaries between work and personal life. To reflect this multifaceted conceptualization, we developed the Multidimensional Quiet Quitting (MQQ) scale, comprising four interrelated dimensions: (1) lack of job‐specific engagement, (2) lack of generalized work engagement, (3) lack of social connections at work, and (4) boundary setting. Using a content validation sample of working adults (N= 114), we evaluated the scale's content validity. We then examined its latent structure and internal consistency using experience sampling data from 124 professionals over 10 weeks, followed by confirmatory factor analysis in an independent replication sample (N= 290). Finally, we mapped the nomological network of quiet quitting by examining associations with theoretically relevant antecedents and outcomes. Results indicated that organizational newcomers and younger employees were slightly more prone to quiet quitting, while job autonomy, work responsibility, marriage, and childcare responsibilities served as protective factors. Quiet quitters also tended to be less extraverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, and agreeable. Quiet quitting and disengagement were each associated with concurrent and subsequent mental health and work outcomes. Quiet quitting components incrementally predicted stress, job satisfaction, burnout, and work effectiveness beyond traditional work disengagement, an overlapping construct. By specifying and measuring quiet quitting as a multidimensional construct, this study provides much‐needed construct clarity and demonstrates empirical effects associated with the phenomenon. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Management of Self-Renewable Resource in a Production-Inventory System</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a production-inventory system in which production relies on a self-renewable natural resource. The resource regenerates at a rate that depends on its current stock as well as random environmental factors. In each period, the firm decides on the production quantity, facing stochastic demand and limited resource. This type of system is common in industries such as fishing and logging. We model the resource’s self-renewal using a generating function and formulate the production optimization problem as a dynamic program. We find that because of the renewable nature of the resource, the optimal stock level does not necessarily increase with the available resource quantity, and could become higher than the optimal stock level for a benchmark system where resource is unlimited. In a special case with deterministic demand and environment, we show that it could be optimal to halt production even with zero inventory left, in order to preserve the growth of resource. On the other hand, it could also be optimal to raise the inventory level to be higher than demand, when overpopulation becomes an issue. Moreover, a higher market price, which stems from adverse environmental conditions and signals lower future yields, can incentivize the firm to reduce production and conserve resources for future growth. In a deterministic environment where the inventory is fully perishable, we analytically characterize the long-run dynamics of the resource quantity. In particular, sustainable production is more achievable for low-margin products, and a myopic production firm does not necessarily deplete the resource. We conduct numerical experiments using real-world salmon population data to test the robustness of our findings in general systems with stochastic environment and non-perishable products. The results show that ignoring either the resource constraint or the self-renewal dynamics, could lead to high operational costs and undermine resource sustainability.</content>

    <title>Funding the Real Deal: Dynamic Moral Hazard with Adverse Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study dynamic contracts that incentivize an agent to exert effort to increase the arrival rate of a Poisson breakthrough, where both the effort cost and the effort level at any time are the agent’s private information. Optimally, the principal offers a menu of contracts, each tailored to an agent type (with a different effort cost), specifying an initial payment, a contract deadline, and a payment-upon-arrival process over time. We first fully characterize the optimal contract menu in a two-type setting, where the agent is either a good (low-cost) or bad (high-cost) type. Specifically, the principal should hire the agent only if the breakthrough revenue exceeds a threshold. Above this threshold, if the bad agent’s cost is higher than another threshold, it is optimal to motivate only the good type to exert effort. The principal offers the good type a simple linear contract in which the payment-upon-arrival declines linearly over time until the deadline, whereas the bad type receives an initial payment and leaves immediately. The linear contract provides just enough incentive for the good agent to work. If the bad agent’s cost falls below the threshold, it becomes optimal to also motivate the bad agent to work using a linear contract, whereas offering the good agent a one-switch contract. The one-switch contract extends the linear form by allowing the payment-upon-arrival to take a single downward jump at a specific time before the deadline. The optimal contract structure extends to multiple-type cases, in which the one-switch contract becomes a multiple-switch contract. To obtain the entire menu of contracts, one only needs to solve a sequence of linear optimization problems together with a bisectional line-search, which is fast to compute and easy to interpret and implement.Funding: F.

    <title>How and When Are High-Frequency Stock Returns Predictable?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the predictability of ultrahigh-frequency stock returns and durations to relevant price, volume, and transaction events using machine learning methods. We find that contrary to low-frequency and long-horizon returns, where predictability is rare and inconsistent, predictability in high-frequency returns and durations is large, systematic, and pervasive over short horizons. We identify the relevant predictors constructed from trades and quotes data, and we examine what determines the variation in predictability across the stock’s own characteristics and market environments. Next, we compute how the predictability improves with the timeliness of the data on a scale of milliseconds and conversely degrades with delays, providing a valuation of each millisecond gained. Finally, we simulate the impact of getting an (imperfect) peek at the incoming order flow, a look-ahead ability that is often attributed to the fastest high-frequency traders, in terms of improving the predictability of the returns and durations.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02435 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Free-Riding Product Returns to Drive Profits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Returning products has become standard practice for consumers, and a significant "pain point" for retailers. The authors contend that returns can be harnessed to increase profits. This requires retailers to manage the interweaving dynamics of product returns and purchase. The strategy is to co-manage a virtuous cycle whereby current returns increase future purchases, and a vicious cycle whereby current returns increase future returns. Marketing executes the strategy. It generates purchases. The returns that follow impose a direct cost due to the vicious cycle. However, the virtuous cycle of returns can offset this, enabling the retailer to “free-ride” returns by optimizing its marketing. The approach follows the Decision Support System (DSS) paradigm by combining a conceptual model, a statistical model, data, and optimization. A core construct is a stock variable tracking consumers’ memory of return experiences. This drives both the virtuous and vicious cycles. The authors optimize marketing spend accounting for Return Stock. The best results are when dynamics are included in both the statistical and optimization models. Results suggests managers should avoid strict return policies aimed at eliminating returns. Instead, they should design policies that optimally balance the long-term benefits and costs of returns.</content>

    <title>Rigidity in Crisis: The Impact of OHSAS 18001 Certification on Production Repurposing During COVID‐19</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is important for firms to repurpose production responsively during a crisis such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, to seize the market opportunity and create social value. However, occupational health and safety (OHS) can also be a concern in a crisis, and adherence to OHS management systems can undermine a firm's responsiveness in repurposing decision making. We adopt the “capability–rigidity” lens to construct a connection between OHS management standards (i.e., OHSAS 18001) and firms’ adaptation responsiveness. After sampling 734 listed Chinese manufacturing firms, our match‐based analysis reveals that firms certified with OHSAS 18001 were less responsive during COVID‐19 in terms of production repurposing than those without the certification. Yet, certain experience, namely, prepandemic manufacturing of related products, experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and being geographically located close to firms that produced medical supplies, could attenuate this effect. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of and adding to the literature on safety management, certified management standards, and organizational adaptation and learning.</content>

    <title>Social Pricing of Luxury Products in a Distribution Channel</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok has greatly facilitated social interactions among individuals, and thus their product consumption has become more visible to their peers. This enhanced visibility influences consumers' purchase decisions of luxury products because it affects social value derived from conspicuous consumption of these products. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to study the impact of such social technologies on social pricing of a manufacturer and a retailer offering luxury products along a distribution channel. Consumers exhibit conspicuous consumption preferences and are grouped intosnobsandconformists: Snobs value product exclusivity, while conformists desire product popularity. We derive the following interesting results. First, a better social technology that leads to higher visibility for conspicuous consumption can either raise or lower the wholesale price and retail price. Second, the manufacturer may gain (lose) while the retailer may lose (gain) under a better social technology; that is, the manufacturer's and retailer's preferences regarding the level of a social technology may not be aligned. Third, the advancement of a social technology may harm consumer surplus. Lastly, we consider several model extensions to validate our findings in broader contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms often encourage existing customers to recruit new customers. In this paper, we analytically study the customer referrals in a two‐period newsvendor model, where the demand generated by referrals increases in the previous sales. In this framework, we establish the structural results for the optimal inventory level, as well as evaluate the value of referral programs. We find that the customer referrals are more attractive for firms selling nonperishable products than for those selling perishable products. Overall, this study underscores the operational value of customer referrals, particularly for firms selling nonperishable products.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Tokenization on Ride‐Hailing Blockchain Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid development of blockchain has inspired many traditional centralized intermediaries to transform their transaction models, especially for the peer‐to‐peer market. Lately, the token‐based (blockchain) system (with cryptocurrency) is gaining popularity. However, little is known about the (comparative) performance of different operating types. In this study, we build an analytical framework to find the optimal strategies for the token‐based and non‐token‐based blockchain (as a special application scenario) platforms and derive the essential model properties and characteristics. We analytically show how the optimal mining bonus depends on the fraction of reserved tokens sold to customers and on the price‐to‐sales ratio. Furthermore, we obtain several actionable findings for choosing suitable platform types under different scenarios. The shift from the non‐token‐based platform to the token‐based platform may yield greater social welfare unless the non‐token‐based system operates with a much larger ride price, which we show to be unrealistic for the considered Beijing case through numerical studies. Moreover, we find that the matching probability for the token‐based platform is predominantly higher than that for the non‐token‐based one. Besides, government interventions may encourage a path toward a fair consensus mechanism or a high decentralization level in order to enhance social welfare. One unanticipated finding is that a higher decentralization level may lead to a lower mining capacity shortage and so to a more efficient system, indicating that the combination of blockchain and the sharing economy has much potential.</content>

    <title>Industry 4.0 Technologies: Empirical Impacts and Decision Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industry 4.0 technologies have been regarded as powerful means to enhance a firm's competitiveness in the Internet of Things environment. However, implementing Industry 4.0 technologies calls for considerable capital expenditure and might interrupt normal production in the short term. This study conducts an empirical analysis of the impact of investing in Industry 4.0 technologies based on a sample of 563 investment announcements of publicly listed firms on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2018. Using the event study method, we find empirical evidence that these investment announcements lead to positive stock market reactions and improved financial performance. In particular, we empirically evaluate firms’ short‐ and long‐term stock prices and financial measures by considering the type of investments (i.e., digital or physical investments), whether the investment is product‐oriented or manufacturing process‐oriented, and whether the technologies are applied within a firm or across the supply chain. Our empirical findings hold true when a firm's strategic decision is accounted for and remain robust through various tests. Furthermore, we propose a decision framework for firms to balance the tradeoff between short‐term disruption and long‐term benefits resulting from an investment in Industry 4.0. Specifically, we develop a two‐period model and investigate when and to what extent a firm should invest in Industry 4.0 technologies. Empirical and modeling analyses provide managerial insights for firms that grapple with the net benefit of investment in Industry 4.0.</content>

    <title>Minimax Optimality in Contextual Dynamic Pricing with General Valuation Models</title>
    <updated>2025-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study contextual dynamic pricing, where a decision maker posts personalized prices based on observable contexts and receives binary purchase feedback indicating whether the customer’s valuation exceeds the price. Each valuation is modeled as an unknown latent function of the context, corrupted by independent and identically distributed market noise from an unknown distribution. Relying only on Lipschitz continuity of the noise distribution and bounded valuations, we propose a minimax-optimal algorithm. To accommodate the unknown distribution, our method discretizes the relevant noise range to form a finite set of candidate prices, then applies layered data partitioning to obtain confidence bounds substantially tighter than those derived via the elliptical potential lemma. A key advantage is that estimation bias in the valuation function cancels when comparing upper confidence bounds, eliminating the need to know the Lipschitz constant. The framework extends beyond linear models to general function classes through offline regression oracles. Our regret analysis depends solely on the oracle’s estimation error, typically governed by the statistical complexity of the class. These techniques yield a regret upper bound matching the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we refine these guarantees under additional structures—for example, linear valuation models, second-order smoothness, sparsity, and known noise distribution or observable valuations—and compare our bounds and assumptions with prior dynamic-pricing methods. Finally, numerical experiments corroborate the theory and show clear improvements over benchmark methods.Funding: X.

    <title>Data-Pooling Reinforcement Learning for Preventative Healthcare Intervention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging needs of tailored intervention for heterogeneous populations in preventative healthcare applications, we consider a multistage, dynamic decision-making problem in the online setting with unknown model parameters. To deal with the pervasive issue of small sample size in parameter estimation, we develop a novel data-pooling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that adaptively pools historical data, with three main innovations: (i) the weight of pooling is directly tied to the performance of the decision (measured by regret) as opposed to estimation accuracy in conventional methods; (ii) no parametric assumptions are needed between historical and current data; and (iii) requiring data-sharing only via aggregate statistics, as opposed to patient-level data. Our data-pooling algorithm framework unifies a variety of RL algorithms, and we establish a theoretical performance guarantee that quantifies the regret bound reduction from our adaptive pooling design compared with benchmarks. We substantiate the theoretical development with extensive empirical experiments via a case study in the context of postdischarge intervention to prevent unplanned readmissions, generating practical insights into healthcare management. Our algorithm enables organizations to leverage public data or published studies for patient management and supports policymakers in promoting aggregate data sharing to enhance population health outcomes.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using exogenous variation in the timing and geographic location of U.S. Congressional elections, we find that the probability of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement actions against foreign firms increases significantly preceding senatorial elections, spiking more than 21%, with no commensurate increase for globally operating domestically headquartered firms in these same senators’ states. Using hand-collected case-level data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), we observe that these pre-election cases tend to be weaker overall and that they are brought significantly more often against foreign firms that operate in less-important industries in the senator’s state and when they have a smaller overall U.S. presence. This spike in foreign firm targeting is accompanied by a significant spike in traditional and social media coverage coupled with sharply negative sentiment. Furthermore, these enforcement actions and media spikes are associated with electoral consequences, specifically greater vote shares and better poll results for enforcement-state senators. The FCPA enforcement actions have real impacts on firms. These include a 10% reduction in market value after enforcement actions against foreign firms and a significant decrease in credit ratings.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00476 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study leverages advanced text-analysis techniques to investigate how increased product market rivalry, induced by Chinese import competition, affects innovation among incumbent U.S. firms in the electronic and electrical appliance industry. We measure the similarity between the product descriptions of U.S. firms and those of Chinese importers, thus capturing firm-level competitive pressure. Employing a continuous difference-in-differences framework, we compare innovation outcomes of U.S. firms more directly competing with Chinese importers to those facing lower competitive pressure over a five-year period before and after initial Chinese market entry. We find that incumbent U.S. firms significantly increase their quality-weighted patent production, create more new-product patents, and strategically diversify into new technological and business segments when confronted with heightened competition. Our findings highlight the role of import-driven rivalry in stimulating strategic innovation and illustrate how text-based similarity measures can effectively quantify firm-level competition, providing novel methodological tools for strategy scholars.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Funding: B.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly connects observed portfolio choices to correlations of individual income shocks with an aggregate shock (or, equivalently, with stock market returns). The share of nonparticipating individuals displaying a positive correlation, and therefore a negative hedging demand for stocks, is above 79% in both our samples. Furthermore, correlations predict nonparticipation to the equity market, also out-of-sample and for the same individual over time. These results support the traditional hedging motive explanation for nonparticipation. Such new insight owes to the income shocks comovements across individuals, which we model and exploit to identify correlations.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Inquire Europe, Observatoire de l’Epargne Européenne (OEE), and The Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) Department of Excellence Award for years 2018–2022 and 2023–2027.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06893 .</content>

    <title>Make Social Media Social Again: How Platform Interoperability Can Fix Social Media and Future‐Proof Democracy</title>
    <updated>2025-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This essay argues that social media document (rather than fuel) the decline ofpoliticaldemocracy while helping reviveorganizationaldemocracy, including through ‘decentralized autonomous organizations’ (DAOs). Yet, despite giving everyone a voice and the ability to organize across borders, social media could over‐concentrate power if, in the future, a few large but siloed platforms ended up shrinking viewpoint diversity – the oxygen of democracy. How can we curb corporate platform concentration without dulling democracy? Due to trade‐offs in platform design, no single service can deliver free speech, free usage, and safe usage simultaneously. Fortunately, this ‘trilemma’ can be transcended at the industry level with an interoperability mandate that fosters user multihoming and lets various platforms provide different bundles of democratic benefits. Email works across service providers, and so can social media. Interoperability thus represents a viable answer based on six advantages: practical feasibility; competition on merit; faster complementor innovation; jurisdictional flexibility; unlocking network effects between, rather than just within platforms; and alignment with democratic values. Platform interoperability can make social media social again and future‐proof democracy. This proposal is a clarion call for blaming the Internet a little less for democracy’s problems and instead leveraging its infrastructure strategically to address them.</content>

    <title>Shaping the System Through Turbulence: Strategic Leadership and the Micro‐Foundations of Ecosystem Orchestration in Times of Disruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While research on ecosystems and their orchestration has grown rapidly, we still know little about how individual strategic leaders may mobilize ecosystemic action in times of disruption. This article addresses this gap by drawing on an in‐depth case study of the Antwerp Square Mile, the world’s oldest and most renowned diamond trading ecosystem. Analysing how leading individuals orchestrated the Mile’s response to lab‐grown diamonds, we identify three key pathways through which individuals can steer ecosystems amid disruptive innovation: acognitive pathway, in which leaders shape the system’s collective interpretations of the disruption as well as itself; asocial pathway, in which leaders sustain and reconfigure changing relational ties across ecosystem participants; and anemotional pathway, in which leaders manage shifting affective dynamics to maintain engagement and resilience. By highlighting how ecosystems can be meaningfully guided through disruption by everyday acts of interpretation, connection, and affective interaction, this study contributes an important micro‐foundational angle to existing macro‐level explanations in times of systemic turbulence – shedding light on the small, to comprehend the grand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how market participants trade on private information about firm fundamentals using the largest known case of informed trade of earnings announcements. From 2011 to 2015, a cartel of sophisticated traders illegally obtained early access to and traded on over 1,000 firm earnings announcements. Using this setting, I identify the information in earnings announcements that these market participants found most price relevant. The informed traders preferred announcements with larger earnings and sales surprises relative to forecasts, quantitative managerial guidance, and more extreme news sentiment. Despite their perfect foresight, the traders performed, perhaps surprisingly, poorly relative to hypothetical trading strategies based on comparable foresight. Frictions that limited their performance include price impact, risk aversion, and information processing costs. The trading performance of these informed traders implies that information about firm fundamentals explains little of the cross‐sectional variation in earnings announcement returns, even for sophisticated market participants.</content>

    <title>Do Nature‐Loving CEOs Make the World Greener?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between CEOs’ preferences for environmental protection (“nature‐loving preferences”) and corporate environmental actions. Drawing on social ecology research, I develop a proxy for CEOs’ nature‐loving preferences based on their childhood exposure to greenspace and validate it using their positive discussions of nature during earnings conference calls. Findings show a significant positive association between CEOs’ nature‐loving preferences and their firms’ participation in Clean Development Mechanism projects. This effect remains robust after addressing firm–CEO matching and omitted variable concerns. Cross‐sectional tests reveal stronger effects when local environmental demands are high and when CEOs have greater decision‐making power. Further analyses suggest that these CEOs are associated with greater corporate carbon reduction, while market reactions to their appointments remain neutral. The study highlights the link between CEOs’ personal environmental preferences and firms’ environmental actions, offering new insights into individual‐level factors behind corporate social responsibility.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Brave New Telemedicine: Cognitive Bias and the Anticoagulant Gap in Atrial Fibrillation Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Telemedicine has transformed healthcare delivery, yet its impact on the quality and consistency of clinical decision-making remains underexplored in operations management. While heralded for efficiency and access, it is unclear whether virtual care systematically alters adherence to clinical practice guidelines. This study investigates whether the mode of care, telemedicine versus in-person, affects clinicians’ guideline-recommended prescribing of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, where treatment adherence is crucial to prevent severe outcomes. Using electronic medical record data from 16,603 patient encounters at a major academic health system in the United States (2020–2023), we employ a two-way fixed-effects linear probability model to compare prescribing patterns. We find that telemedicine visits are associated with a 5.2-percentage-point lower probability of guideline-recommended anticoagulant prescription than in-person visits. The gap is driven by clinicians with historically lower adherence; top-quartile clinicians show no difference across modalities, exhibitingbehavioral robustness(adherence resilient to modality). We propose that telemedicine’s leaner information channel heightens perceived uncertainty, activating cognitive biases: for some clinicians, telemedicine exacerbatesambiguity aversionandomission bias, favoring inaction in virtual settings. Linking service design to variation in professional judgment, we show how operational context moderates decision quality. Practically, healthcare organizations should not treat telemedicine as a simple substitute for in-person care; they should implement targeted operational interventions, such as enhanced decision support and training on cognitive biases, to maintain high standards of care so efficiency and access gains do not come at the cost of adherence. In a supplementary analysis, we estimate that, at the population level in the United States, a 5.2-percentage-point telemedicine-related gap in anticoagulant prescribing could result in more than 150 preventable strokes and roughly $50 million in avoidable lifetime costs annually for each newly diagnosed cohort, underscoring its substantial clinical and economic significance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Practical Guide to Endogeneity Correction Using Copulas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Causal inference is of central interest in many empirical applications, yet often challenging because of the presence of endogenous regressors. The classical approach to the problem requires using instrumental variables that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction. In recent research, instrument-free copula methods have been increasingly used to handle endogenous regressors. This article aims to provide a practical guide for how to handle endogeneity using copulas. The authors give an overview of copula endogeneity correction, outlining its theoretical rationales, advantages, and limitations for empirical research. They also discuss recent advances that enhance the understanding, applicability, and robustness of copula correction, and address implementation aspects of copula correction such as constructing copula control functions and handling higher-order terms of endogenous regressors. To facilitate the appropriate usage of copula correction in order to realize its full potential, the authors detail a process of checking data requirements and identification assumptions to determine when and how to use copula correction methods, and illustrate its usage using empirical examples.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit an episode of plausibly random debt discharge due to the loss of paperwork for thousands of defaulted borrowers to examine the effects of private student debt relief on borrower outcomes. We find that borrowers who receive debt relief (treated) experience declines in debt balances and delinquency rates onotheraccounts, and increases in mobility and income relative to those who bear the costs of default like wage garnishment and collections (control). Borrowers in both groups contribute to our findings through different mechanisms. While our estimates may not directly apply to blanket student loan forgiveness, they speak to the benefits of forgiveness in reducing the consequences of debt burden for distressed borrowers.</content>

    <title>Losing Control? The Two‐Decade Decline in Loan Covenant Violations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The annual proportion of U.S. public firms that reported a financial covenant violation fell roughly 70% between 1997 and 2019. To understand this trend, we develop an estimable model of covenant design that depends on the ability to differentiate between distressed and nondistressed borrowers and the relative costs associated with screening incorrectly. We find that the drop in violations is best explained by an increased willingness to forgo early detection of distressed borrowers in exchange for fewer inconsequential violations, which we attribute largely to a shift in the composition of public borrowers and partly to heightened investor sentiment during the 2010s.</content>

    <title>Seeing Expectations as “Opportunities”: Interpretive Philosophy and the Origins of “Opportunity” Perceptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop arguments against the objective opportunity construct and argue that “opportunities” should be understood as wholly and fundamentally subjective. We define and elaborate “opportunities” as expectations attainable only through intervening action, with requisite propositional attitudes of both desirability and feasibility. These revisions imply a fundamental shift in the foundations of entrepreneurship theory. Such a shift prompts us to rethink the nature of entrepreneurial cognition, allows us to elaborate the myriad—indeed endless—ways “opportunities” can manifest, and engenders clearer and more specific theorizing on the processual navigation of reality’s unfolding vis-à-vis “opportunity” expectations and consequent entrepreneurial plans.</content>

    <title>The technological uniqueness paradox</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish a new paradox surrounding technological uniqueness, defined as the degree to which a firm's patented technology portfolio differs from its competitors. On the one hand, technological uniqueness acts as a barrier to incoming technology spillovers and impedes firm performance. On the other hand, technological uniqueness reduces outgoing technology spillovers and contributes to a strategic resource that is more costly to imitate. We empirically examine these competing arguments and find evidence that the strategic resource argument dominates for average firms in the data with more technologically unique firms performing better. At the same time, we show that pursuing technological uniqueness is costly, as unique firms indeed benefit less from incoming technology spillovers, are harder to understand by equity analysts and have higher costs of equity capital.Managerial SummaryWe establish empirically for a sample of public corporations that being technologically unique pays off‐companies with distinctive patent portfolios outperform their peers on average. This uniqueness creates a competitive moat that is difficult for rivals to overcome. But there is a catch: the same uniqueness that protects a company also isolates it. When technology is so different from conventional wisdom, it becomes difficult for outsiders to understand, then a contrarian company will also struggle to learn from others' breakthroughs. We empirically document a double penalty: contrarian companies benefit less from innovations by peer firms and equity analysts can't easily evaluate the business, driving up the cost of capital.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extract information about future economic conditions from firms’ cross-border merger and acquisition announcements, and show it predicts changes in relative economic growth rates and foreign exchange rate returns. We find the predictability is driven by the acquisition decisions of domestic firms, which signal turning points in local economic growth. The findings are motivated by a simple model of exchange rate determination with heterogeneous expectations and support the theorized relationship between foreign exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals. The results provide new tools for policy makers seeking to predict economic activity and offer global investors a novel source of portfolio diversification.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In January 2021, a group of stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges experienced sudden price increases, which, coupled with high short interest, led to short squeezes. We find that discussions on social media fueled the association between retail trading and subsequent stock returns. Options market activity and securities lending constraints also played a central role. Using unique data from social media platforms, we provide a comprehensive account of these short squeezes. We find that they significantly impeded market quality for the stocks at issue and their competitors. Thus, the interplay between social media and retail traders may have adverse consequences for market quality and efficiency.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02887 .</content>

    <title>Magic Will Happen if You Gather Us in One Room: Gender Homophily and Women-Only Networking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although networking is critical for career advancement, prior research has primarily examined women’s networking in comparison to men’s, often concluding that it plays a less instrumental role due to gendered organizational structures. Women-only networking events are organized to enable women to leverage gender homophily for mutual support and career advancement. However, the mechanisms of gender homophily in women’s networking are not straightforward. Drawing on observations of women-only networking events, interviews, and secondary data, we identify three meanings women attach to homophilic networking (status-driven, instrumental, and expressive) and show how these meanings shape networking behaviors. In networking contexts characterized by “enforced homophily,” where support is offered under the guise of benevolence, women are more aware of these differences in meanings, which prevent them from leveraging the potential benefits of networking with other women. In contexts characterized by “agentic homophily,” the relevance of these differences is less salient, empowering women to challenge, rather than reproduce, gendered organizational structures. Our research extends the understanding of gender homophily as a multifaceted force that is dynamically shaped by the context and interactions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Growing discussions of impact investing and stakeholder capitalism have increased interest in measuring companies' social impact. We conceptualize corporate social impact as the welfare loss that would be caused by a firm's exit. To illustrate, we quantify the social impacts of 74 firms in 12 industries using a new survey measuring consumer and worker substitution patterns combined with models of product and labor markets. We find that consumer surplus is the primary component of social impact, suggesting that consumer impacts deserve more attention from impact investors. Existing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and social impact ratings are essentially unrelated to our economically grounded measures.</content>

    <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Predicting FDA’s 510(k) Medical Device Recalls Using Device Citation Relationships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than 90% of medical devices in the United States are approved through the Food and Drug Administration’s 510(k) pathway, primarily based on demonstrating the equivalence of new devices (known as applicant devices) to previously cleared devices (known as predicate devices). However, safety concerns are raised as applicant devices cleared this way may be more prone to recalls that relate to substantial patient harm and financial strain on the healthcare system. In response, this work introduces a data-driven information technology approach to predict medical device recalls, aiming to alleviate these safety concerns by augmenting human decision making. The approach primarily uses the characteristics of the network formed by predicate device citation relationships (predicate network). It uses deep learning to tackle three design challenges: learning the predicate network structure, capturing the temporal patterns of predicate network characteristics, and accounting for dependencies across the predicate citation history. Based on 45,398 medical devices cleared between 2003 and 2020, the approach substantially improves recall prediction accuracy and timeliness compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. The improved recall-prediction performance and insights into performance variations across device categories provide opportunities to preemptively react to potential recalls and improve the safety of devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway.</content>

    <title>Service Work as Lived Experience: A Problematizing Review</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between employee burnout and growing recruitment challenges, a systemic crisis confronts the service industry. One reason lies in the scope of received human resource management (HRM) approaches, which often emphasize organizational performance metrics at the expense of the emotional, social, and material experiences of doing frontline service work. As a result, many HRM solutions do not fully address the experiential realities that shape employee wellbeing, engagement, and retention. This paper calls for a stronger focus on how service workers interpret, inhabit, and appropriate the everyday realities of their work. Through a problematizing review, we build on an emerging, inter‐disciplinary body of research that builds rich, grounded accounts of frontline service experiences. We propose a new experience‐centric framework—a set of theoretical tools and a conceptual vocabulary that put forth a more holistic understanding of the lived experience of service work. We conclude by offering a set of recommendations that can help foster more resilient, engaged, and people‐centered service environments.</content>

    <title>Between Consistency and Adaptation: How Middle Managers Shape Compensation System Implementation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of a human resource management (HRM) system or subsystem, such as a compensation system, hinges on its implementation—yet the microfoundations of this process remain underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. Study 1 surveyed middle managers and employees in six organizations to examine their attributions of problems with compensation systems and their perceptions of compensation system effectiveness. We found that both groups identified design problems; managers emphasized administrative problems, whereas employees focused on implementation problems. These differing attributions shaped their views of compensation system effectiveness. To further unpack the challenges middle managers face, we analyzed data from Study 2, a 6‐year long in‐depth case study, exploring how and why middle managers varied in their implementation strategies. We found that middle manager identification with the system and their perceived agency explained their implementation strategies, ranging from championing to compliance, and from appropriation to resignation. Together, the studies reveal persistent tensions between consistency and adaptation in HRM implementation. To address these tension, we introduce the concept ofinternal flexibility—the capacity of middle managers to adjust formal HRM practices during the implementation process to align them with their work unit's needs—as a critical yet underexplored dimension of HRM effectiveness.</content>

    <title>Disambiguating the Effects of Shareholder Activism on Corporate Director Careers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines shareholder activism and its consequences for corporate directors’ career trajectories. We begin by highlighting that the inherent ambiguity surrounding activist interventions implies variation in director careers beyond an overall negative effect. Specifically, we posit and test the notion that the director labor market will differentiate between financially based versus socially based shareholder unrest, with the latter having a stronger negative effect based on (1) its greater information value above and beyond what is already knowable about the firm, and (2) heightened recognition of the need for directors to balance financial performance pressures with responsiveness to evolving environmental, social, and governance concerns. Empirically, we analyze U.S. shareholder activism events between 2014 and 2018, and using Coarsened Exact Matching combined with a Difference-in-Differences approach, we find evidence consistent with our disambiguation perspective on shareholder activism. Our theoretical and empirical analyses also further disambiguate whether director exits reflect market or/and director preferences, and we find evidence for both. We conclude by discussing how our theoretical perspective and empirical findings contribute to research on shareholder activism, director labor markets, and corporate governance.</content>

    <title>Axioms for Automated Market Makers: A Mathematical Framework in FinTech and Decentralized Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts that have emerged as a cornerstone of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), replacing traditional intermediaries for trading digital assets. However, the underlying principles, risks, and economic properties of these novel markets require a rigorous mathematical foundation. In “Axioms for automated market makers: A mathematical framework in fintech and decentralized finance,” Maxim Bichuch and Zachary Feinstein construct such a foundation. The authors propose a set of intuitive axioms for the utility functions that govern AMMs. From this framework, they characterize the resulting swap and pricing properties and define a novel measure of price impact to quantify and compare transaction costs across different AMM designs. The work also addresses practical issues by proposing a new fee structure that ensures indifference to transaction splitting and analyzing the critical risk of divergence loss for liquidity providers, offering a comprehensive guide for designing and analyzing these new financial technologies.</content>

    <title>Do Women Executives Make Workplaces Safer? Evidence from Workplace Safety Violations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we develop and test theory onwhether,when, andhowthe prevalence of women in firms’ top management influences workplace safety – an important ‘do no harm’ dimension of corporate social performance. Consistent with our theorizing, we find that there is a negative relationship between the prevalence of women executives in firms’ top management and workplace safety violations. We show that the relationship is amplified by board gender diversity and ownership by institutional investors who advocate for greater gender diversity in firms’ upper echelons. We also show that the relationship is partially mediated by employee workload. Our findings have important implications for the management literature on the gender profile of firms’ top management and for the workplace safety literature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of risk preferences and frictions in portfolio choice using variation in 401(k) default options. Patterns of active choice in response to different default funds imply that, absent participation frictions, 94% of investors prefer holding stocks, with an equity share of retirement wealth declining with age—patterns markedly different from observed allocations. We use this quasi‐experiment to estimate a life‐cycle model and find a relative risk aversion of 2.5, elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) of 0.25, and $160 portfolio adjustment cost. The results suggest that low levels of stock market participation in retirement accounts are due to participation frictions rather than nonstandard preferences such as loss aversion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study develops a practice-relevant theory explaining why some information technology (IT) unavailability incidents lead to severe and prolonged organizational consequences. By redefining IT unavailability as unmet demand for IT resources rather than simple system downtime, the paper shows how disruptions cascade through information capacity deficits and business capacity deficits, ultimately impairing critical services, affecting clients, and damaging organizational reputation. An analysis of 28 real-world IT unavailability incidents reveals that three reinforcing feedback loops (IT inertia, information inertia, and business inertia) can intensify service disruption, delay recovery, and amplify downstream impacts.</content>

    <title>Asymmetric Learning Effects of Chief Information Officer Outside Board Appointments: Cybersecurity Implications for Sender and Receiver Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cybersecurity failures are increasingly costly, prompting companies to recruit CIOs from other firms to their boards. This study examines whether there any impacts on a firms’ cybersecurity when (a) firms allow their own CIO to serve on an outside board; and (b) when firms appoint a CIO from another company to their own board. Using CIO-firm-year observations, we compare two pathways: (1) receiver firms that appoint an external CIO to their board, and (2) sender firms whose own CIO serves on another company’s board. The findings show asymmetric effects. Receiver firms experience fewer data breaches, suggesting that external CIOs effectively transfer cybersecurity expertise and practices. In contrast, sender firms face higher breach risk, as CIOs who serve externally appear to prioritize educating the recipient firm over acquiring new insights for their home firm. This risk intensifies when the external firm lacks strong cybersecurity practices but is mitigated when the home firm has a dedicated CISO. Conversely, receiver firms benefit most when the sending firm has strong cybersecurity capabilities—or even a past breach—because negative events create valuable lessons. The results offer actionable implications: firms should strategically recruit outside CIOs to improve board-level cyber capabilities and carefully weigh the risks before permitting their own CIOs to serve externally. Policymakers should consider mechanisms that incentivize effective cybersecurity knowledge transfer across board interlocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This exploratory study examines patterns of entrepreneurial engagement across the life course using Group-Based Trajectory Modeling and panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. We identify four distinct career trajectories—never, early-adulthood, mid-adulthood, and career-persistent entrepreneurship—and analyze differences in their timing, duration, and frequency. We then explore how early-life family capital is associated with trajectory membership and how these paths relate to psychological and financial outcomes in middle adulthood. Instead of focusing on single points of entry or exit, this study traces the full arc of entrepreneurial careers—revealing how they unfold, develop, and diverge over the course of individuals’ working lives.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Board Gender Diversity and Supply Chain Risk Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does corporate board gender diversity affect supply chain risk management? Board gender diversity can influence supply chain risk management through behavioral and agency-based mechanisms. Female directors’ greater risk aversion, lower overconfidence in the face of uncertainty, and heightened accountability pressures may lead to stronger oversight and risk mitigation efforts in operations, where risks are quantifiable and failures are highly visible. Therefore, we should expect supply chain risk management to increase with increased women representation in corporate boards. We test this prediction leveraging on a reform requiring California firms to increase board gender diversity. We find that the propensity to use purchase obligations, supply contracts designed to mitigate the risk of future price fluctuations and reduce procurement uncertainty, increased for California buyers following the reform. We also find that California buyers increased their geographic supply chain diversification and became more likely to discontinue relationships with high-default risk suppliers after the reform. These changes are larger when female directors are better positioned to influence corporate decisions, contributing to validate board gender diversity as an important channel for operational changes. The takeaway for corporate leaders, policymakers, and shareholders is that board gender diversity can lead to a greater focus on supply chain risk management, which increases profitability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Diagnosing Why Models Fail Under Distribution Shift and What to Do NextPredictive models often perform worse when deployed in a new target setting, but it is rarely clear why. In “Diagnosing Model Performance Under Distribution Shift,” Cai, Namkoong, and Yadlowsky introduce a diagnostic, distribution shift decomposition (DISDE), that attributes the change in performance from the training to target distributions into terms for (i) an increase in harder but previously seen inputs from training, (ii) changes in how outcomes relate to inputs, and (iii) poor performance on new input regions absent from the training data. Applications to employment prediction demonstrate how this decomposition can inform potential modeling improvements, guiding whether to use domain adaptation techniques, adjust model covariates, or collect new samples. Additionally, DISDE is used to help explain why certain domain adaptation methods fail to improve model performance for satellite image classification.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Designing Effective Procurement Mechanisms for Assembly Systems Under Supply UncertaintyIn their paper “Procurement for Assembly Systems Under Supply Uncertainty: Optimal Mechanisms,” Like Bu, Milind Dawande, and Ganesh Janakiraman explore how manufacturers can effectively source components when suppliers face uncertain yields and possess private information about their production costs. Such challenges are common in industries such as electronics and automotive manufacturing, in which a shortage of a single part can halt the entire assembly line. The authors develop an optimal procurement mechanism that helps manufacturers decide how much to source from each supplier and how to structure payments contingent on uncertain delivery quantities when suppliers’ production efforts cannot be directly observed. Their analysis reveals a practical menu-based contract under which each supplier selects terms best suited to its situation and the manufacturer subsequently determines order quantities for each component. The study provides both theoretical insights and actionable guidance for managing complex supply relationships in uncertain environments.</content>

    <title>The Changing Nature of Firm Innovation: Short-Termism and Influential Innovation in U.S. Public Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the link between short-term pressures and technologically significant innovation in U.S. public firms in 1997–2015. Using a market-based measure of short-term pressure, we estimate its relationship with influential and novel patents. We find that firms facing more intense short-term pressures are less likely to patent highly influential or novel innovations. To evaluate whether this relationship is causal, we use changes in ownership styles following financial institution mergers as instruments. Our analysis suggests that changing short-term pressures from investors had a causal impact on firm innovative outcomes; this finding is robust to a wide variety of empirical specifications. While public firms as a whole retained a constant share of highly influential patents, this activity has become more concentrated in fewer firms. This shift does not appear to be fully compensated by an increase in technologically significant patents by nonpublic firms such as venture-capital (VC)-backed start-ups. These findings raise questions about capital markets’ impact on firm R&amp;D strategy and the nature of innovative activities in public firms.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the inaugural Panmure House Prize for Long-term Thinking and Radical Innovation for this research, as well as Matt Marx for facilitating institutional support at Cornell for this research.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mid- and low-level managers play a significant role within the organizational hierarchy, far beyond monitoring. It is often their responsibility to respond to opportunities and threats within their units by adjusting their subordinates’ assignments. Most such managers, however, lack the authority to adapt their subordinates’ wages. Instead, they rely on other, more restrictive incentive schemes. We study the interaction between a front-line manager and worker and characterize the “managerial style” as a function of the players’ relative patience and information.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Funding: D.

    <title>EXPRESS: The No-Hunger Games: How GLP-1 Medication Adoption is Changing Consumer Food Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The authors examine how consumers modify their food purchases after adopting appetite-suppressing GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic and Wegovy. Using survey responses on medication adoption linked to transaction data from a representative U.S. household panel, the authors document the prevalence, motivations, and demographic patterns of GLP-1 adoption. Households with at least one GLP-1 user reduce grocery spending by 5.3% within six months of adoption, with higher-income households reducing spending by 8.2%. While most food categories see spending declines, the largest reductions are concentrated in calorie-dense, processed categories, including a 10.1% decline in savory snacks. In contrast, a small set of categories show directionally positive changes, with yogurt experiencing the largest increase. Results show an 8.0% decline in spending at fast-food chains, coffee shops, and limited-service restaurants. These food demand adjustments persist through the first year of medication use, though with some attenuation after six months. Households discontinuing GLP-1s revert toward their pre-adoption grocery spending and shift toward slightly less healthy grocery baskets compared to their original baseline. These findings highlight the potential for GLP-1 medications to significantly change consumer food demand, a trend with increasingly important implications for the food industry as GLP-1 adoption continues to grow.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: An Investigation into the Evolution of Marketing Mix Effectiveness: An Empirics-First Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how the effectiveness of three core marketing-mix instruments—price, assortment, and distribution—evolves over time across brands, categories, and countries, using the Empirics-First approach to generate relevant knowledge. The authors analyze household panel data covering over 16,000 brands in 85 consumer packaged goods categories for on average 10 years across 34 countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. They adopt a rolling-window estimation approach to derive time-varying elasticities, followed by a moderator analysis to identify systematic drivers of change. Averaged across time, brand price elasticity is -.640, assortment elasticity is .311, and distribution elasticity is .213. However, time-invariant averages have limited meaning given that 98.5% of brands exhibit significant evolution in at least one instrument’s elasticity. Substantial heterogeneity in trends emerges, moderated by brand, category, and country factors. The single most important predictor is the brand’s baseline (mean) elasticity. The stronger the elasticity, the larger its downward trend. Brand power and whether the brand is a local brand emerge as other key factors. Consumer purchase frequency and share-of-wallet are stronger category predictors of elasticity trajectories than retailer factors. Findings underscore the need for dynamic, elasticity-based resource allocation in brand management.</content>

    <title>Striking a Political Balance? Political Polarization and Firm Innovation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Affective polarization, a division marked by animosity between members of opposing political groups, has dramatically increased, particularly in the United States. This paper examines the extent to which affective polarization may spill over into organizations and influence strategic outcomes—specifically, corporate innovation. I theorize how politically balanced organizations, that is, those that lack a prevailing political ideology and have workforces that are more evenly divided between opposing political stances, are less innovative due to heightened animosity and reduced collaboration. Furthermore, I propose that the negative relationship between political balance and innovation intensifies at higher levels of partisan animosity in society and political engagement among organizational members. Conversely, I theorize that the relationship weakens when a firm is led by a CEO who does not overtly signal a clear political leaning. I test and find support for these predictions using a novel donation-based index of organizational political balance for 744 publicly traded U.S. companies from 2002 to 2015. This paper highlights the role of political balance as a potential conduit of intrafirm rivalry that hinders innovation. The findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms and conditions through which political polarization may influence organizations and their outcomes.</content>

    <title>Vision Communication: A Systematic Review</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vision communication plays a crucial role in leadership, strategic management, and organizational change. However, current research on vision communication is fragmented, leading to a limited understanding of the topic. To advance this topic, this paper synthesizes the existing literature on the dimensions, theoretical mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes of vision communication, drawing on 150 papers. In particular, we identify four key dimensions of vision communication: vision attributes (e.g., imagery, metaphor), vision content (e.g., emphasis on profits or product quality), vision communication frequency (e.g., infrequent vs. frequent), and non-verbal delivery (e.g., emotional displays, eye gaze). Furthermore, we integrate four theoretical perspectives—motivation-based, identification-based, affect-based, and cognition-based—to explain the effects of vision communication. In essence, vision influences various outcomes by ensuring that employees are motivated and feel confident in their ability to achieve them (i.e., motivation-based), identify with the vision or leadership (i.e., identification-based), experience emotional inspiration or positive affect (i.e., affect-based), or understand the vision (i.e., cognition-based). Based on these mechanisms, we outline four categories of moderating factors that shape their impact (e.g., leader factors, follower factors, leader-follower relationships, and contextual factors). Finally, we outline future research directions to further advance research on vision communication.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Borrowers' use of cashless payments improves their access to capital from FinTech lenders and predicts a lower probability of default. These relationships are stronger for cashless technologies providing more precise information, and for outflows. Cashless payment usage complements other signals of borrower quality. We rationalize these empirical findings using a framework in which borrowers signal their lower likelihood of diverting cash flows through payment technology choice, and screening accuracy is further strengthened by informational complementarities. The informational synergy we uncover provides a rationale for the joint rise of cashless payments and FinTech lending, as well as for open banking.</content>

    <title>Audience Entanglement: How Independent Creative Workers Experience the Pressures of Widespread Appeal on Digital Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creative workers often seek a substantial audience for their work. Our findings reveal that a new struggle begins once they attain one. Existing theory fails to account for how creators conceive of and manage the relationship with their audience once their work has gained widespread appeal. In an inductive study of independent creative workers who use digital platforms to share their work, we discovered that after attaining a substantial audience, creators experienceaudience entanglement:a subjective sense of deep interrelatedness between an individual and the audience for their work such that this relationship becomes a persistent consideration in their approach to creating. This entanglement typically begins asdysfunctional entanglement, characterized by feeling an oppressive dependence on audience reactions, struggling with platform volatility, and experiencing distressing emotions. In this state, creators question the meaning of their work and view platform work as unsustainable. Some creators developentanglement management strategies—distancing themselves from audience input, depersonalizing audience critiques, and distilling their personal standards—that shift them to a state offunctional entanglement, or feeling a balanced dependence on audience reactions, accepting platform volatility, and experiencing uplifting emotions. Functional entanglement allows creators to capture meaning from their audience and to view platform work as sustainable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nature Doesn’t Play Dice, It Plays to WinDecision making under uncertainty can be brittle, often failing when real-world data deviates from training assumptions. This study frames this problem as a game between a decision maker and an adversary, nature, who strategically corrupts the data distribution to create a worst case scenario with the cost of these changes defined by optimal transport theory. The authors establish conditions under which a stable outcome, a Nash equilibrium, exists and provide efficient methods to compute it. A key insight is that nature’s optimal strategy corresponds to generating remarkably deceptive adversarial examples; in an image classification task, this strategy can transform an image of an “8” into a convincing “3.” This work provides a powerful framework for developing more reliable models by understanding and countering worst case data perturbations.</content>

The use of gender-inclusive language (GIL) is often considered an instrument that can promote inclusion, yet little is known about its effects on relevant economic behaviors and on gender gaps in the labor market. GIL avoids the masculine “default” (common to many languages) by either explicitly mentioning both masculine and feminine (pro)nouns, or replacing them with nongendered (pro)nouns. Here we study the causal short-run impact of GIL on competitiveness and leadership in the laboratory, with two different language samples—English and German—which differ, among other things, in the extent to which gender is embedded linguistically. We vary GIL in experimental instructions across three treatments ([Formula: see text]): a masculine baseline condition, a condition with feminine and masculine (pro)nouns, and a condition with nongendered (pro)nouns. We find that participants who identify as female and participants who identify as male compete, stand for leadership, and vote on leader candidates similarly across all treatments, in either language. Furthermore, we find no treatment differences in participants’ feelings of inclusion and perceived entitlement. In sum, there is a lack of support for GIL having short-term causal effects on competitive and leadership behavior and inclusion perceptions.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund [Grant SFB F63], UK Research and Innovation [Grant MR/T020253/1], the University of Exeter, and Regensburger Universitätsstiftung Lucia and Dr. Otfried Eberz.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04342 .</content>

    <title>Understanding People’s Preferences for Predictions: People Prioritize Being Right over Minimizing How Wrong They Are in Expectation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work explores the preferences that laypeople exhibit when making and evaluating predictions in the form of point estimates (e.g., the high temperature will be 66°). I propose that people typically have diminishing sensitivity to prediction error: the absolute difference between a prediction and a realized outcome. As a result, people often prioritize “being right,“ focusing on achieving near perfect predictions and placing less emphasis on the magnitude of errors when errors occur. Across 16 studies using varying methods and stimuli, participants exhibited multiple behaviors consistent with diminishing sensitivity to prediction error: (i) predicting the mode of distributions, (ii) restricting predictions to possible outcomes, (iii) reporting decreasing reactions to increasing marginal units of error, and (iv) preferring predictive models built with diminishing sensitivity to error. This behavior diverges from traditional methods of building predictive models and common interpretations of people’s predictions, which often prioritize avoiding large errors and assume that people are predicting the mean. Ultimately, this work not only highlights the discrepancies between our current practices and people’s preferences for predictions but also calls for a more thorough exploration of human objectives before we build models for them to use or make inferences about their beliefs in light of a decision they made.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: I thank the University of Chicago Booth School of Business for financial support.Supplemental Material: Preregistrations, materials, data, code, and supplements are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07257 and at ResearchBox at https://researchbox.org/3130 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Belief change does not always lead to behavior change. This belief–behavior gap has received considerable atention, particularly in the context of misinformation. We expand upon ideas in the literature by offering additional insight derived from research on attitudes. Specifically, we propose that lessons from attitudes research can be applied to the belief–behavior relationship to further understand when belief change will and will not promote behavior change. We discuss the role of attitudes in determining how beliefs shape behavior, the value of measuring and targeting attitudes in research on behavior change, and factors that can influence theattitude–behaviorrelationship as a means to gain insight into thebelief–behaviorrelationship. As part of our review, we also offer recommendations as to how belief‐targeting interventions might be improved to increase their impact on downstream behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the structure of public firm buyouts in a model that features the Berle-Means problem (lack of incentives) and the Grossman-Hart problem (holdout). We find that bootstrapping, debt in excess of funding needs, and upfront fees to bidders are socially optimal and increase buyout premiums. These elements make LBO financing tantamount to a “management contract” arranged by an outside manager to receive cash and incentives to manage a firm—except the cash is funded by excess debt imposed on the firm. Our model also rationalizes why PE firms collect fees from their equity partnerships and directly from target firms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Introduction of online degree programs: A competitive framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Educational services contribute $315.65 billion to the U.S. GDP, with online education representing the fastest-growing segment. This paper examines how operational and market factors influence universities’ decisions to introduce online degree programs. We study the strategic introduction of such programs in a vertically differentiated market, where universities differ in online program rankings (quality) and compete for a diverse student population with varying willingness to pay for perceived quality. Our analysis focuses on a simultaneous market entry scenario, yielding robust insights that also hold under alternative settings–such as when universities are equally ranked or differ in their variable costs of technology. We also examine two additional contexts: (1) a mixed competition setting in which one university operates independently while the other is guided by a social planner, and (2) an incumbent–entrant setting in which a university considers launching an online program when its competitor has already entered the market.Our findings reveal that symmetric market entry–where both universities introduce online programs–is more likely when technology integration costs exceed a certain threshold and student valuation heterogeneity is significant. In contrast, when these costs fall below the threshold, asymmetric equilibria arise in which only one university introduces an online program. When a social planner regulates tuition at the lower-ranked university, it faces tighter constraints on entering the market. However, when the higher-ranked university is subject to tuition regulation, broader market coverage and improved social welfare outcomes are achieved. Additionally, lower-ranked universities can strategically enter by targeting lower-end segments through moderate technology investments and competitive pricing. Yet, the entry of a higher-ranked rival can exert downward pressure on tuition fees for both institutions, promoting a more accessible educational environment. These insights offer strategic guidance for universities navigating quality-based competition and provide policy implications for balancing competitive dynamics with educational equity through regulatory interventions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape operations across industries. Yet its real-world impact reveals a jagged and uneven implementation frontier. To make sense of this emerging landscape, we develop a foundational framework that synthesizes research and practice at the intersection of AI and Operations Management (OM), anchored in three interdependent pillars: (1) AI for OM, (2) OM for AI, and (3) Human–AI Interaction. First, AI for OM analyzes how AI enhances core operational processes, including design, procurement, production, and delivery. Second, OM for AI argues that scaling AI safely and effectively stands to benefit from core OM principles, including workflow design, capacity management, process control, drift detection, and continuous improvement, all of which are central to AI development and deployment. Third, Human–AI Interaction emphasizes the role of trust, incentives, and organizational design in mediating how humans and machines learn from and collaborate with each other. This triadic framework provides a foundation for organizing research on AI and OM and offers practical guidance for integrating AI into business and societal systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a robust, flexible, and easy-to-implement method for estimating the yield curve from treasury securities. Our nonparametric method learns the discount curve in a function space that we motivate by economic principles. We show in an extensive empirical study on U.S. Treasury securities that our method strongly dominates all parametric and nonparametric benchmarks. It achieves substantially smaller out-of-sample yield and pricing errors while being robust to outliers and data selection choices. We attribute the superior performance to the optimal trade-off between flexibility and smoothness, which positions our method as the new standard for yield curve estimation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01401 .</content>

    <title>Social Media Is a Threat for Democracy! A Political Perspective for Analysing and Diminishing Harm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms, once hailed as potential champions of dialogue, have evolved into commodified spaces in which their business models incentivize hate speech, misinformation, polarization, and the political fragmentation of society, benefiting corporate and political elites while eroding democracy. The existing market and technological conceptualizations of social media platforms offer only partial analysis of and solutions to these issues. This paper advances a political perspective grounded in deliberative democracy, arguing that social media companies are political actors responsible for maintaining a well‐functioning public sphere. We argue that transforming social media platforms into true facilitators of democratic discourse requires enhancing theirdeliberative capacity. Beyond the capacities of the public sphere suggested by the market and technology perspectives (1) transparency and accountability and (2) openness and inclusiveness, we propose that fostering deliberative capacity also requires (3) conduciveness to argumentation and (4) consequentiality. We thus contribute to understanding how management theories can explain and address current threats to democracy.</content>

    <title>Modes of Reasoning in Management and Organization Studies: Promises and Perils of Abduction and Induction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Debates about theorizing in management and organization studies have at their core the question of how scholars mobilize different modes of reasoning. The principles ofdeductionandinductionhave long structured methodological discussions. The third way –abduction– derived from Peirce’s conception of ‘inference to the best explanation’, has gained traction in debates about how to generate novel and original theoretical insights. ThisPoint–Counterpointdebate focusses on the promises and perils of abduction vis‐à‐vis induction as modes of reasoning. In theirPoint, Fleming and Oswick propose ‘loosely coupled abduction’ as a mode of reasoning that steers a middle ground between unbounded, ‘creative’ abduction and highly proceduralized, ‘disciplined’ abduction. In theirCounterpoint, Filatotchev et al. accept the creative promise of abduction but warn that consensus‐based plausibility can engender what they call ‘semiotic abduction’, where mechanisms become widely accepted through repetition rather than verification. Building on these contributions, in this introduction to the debate, I situate abduction within the broader landscape of deductive and inductive reasoning in management research, critically evaluate the arguments advanced by thePointandCounterpoint, and propose avenues for future research on the role of abductive reasoning in management and organization studies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of uncertainty shocks on firm‐level economic activity depends on their origin in supply chains. Upstream (downstream) uncertainty from suppliers (customers) is associated with variability over future input (output) prices. Consequently, a real‐option production model with time‐to‐build suggests that only upstream uncertainty suppresses investment, since upstream (downstream) uncertainty affects the shorter (longer) run. Production network data show that upstream uncertainty negatively affects firm‐level outcomes. Conversely, downstream uncertainty affects firm‐level outcomes more weakly but positively. At the macro level, these two uncertainties oppositely predict aggregate growth and asset prices. Overall, downstream uncertainty has an expansionary effect, in contrast to other facets of uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conceptualizing impatience as an emotion, and patience as the regulation of that emotion, offers new insights and opportunities for the study of consumer behavior. While this framework has primarily been applied to impatience for positive events, many real‐life events of interest involve decisions about negative or mixed‐valence events. In this commentary, I explore how impatience and patience play out in these situations, explaining a set of previously disconnected “anomalies” in the literature on intertemporal choice, yielding fresh insights and applications in consumer psychology. Finally, I explore when and how people may want to cultivate (rather than regulate) impatience for gains and losses.</content>

    <title>Can Regulation Restore Authenticity? Evidence from Policies Against Online Review Suppression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Businesses have long sought to shape their online reputations, not only by soliciting positive reviews but also by suppressing negative ones through legal threats. Such practices distort consumer decision-making and undermine trust in digital marketplaces. To address this problem, the U.S. Congress enacted the Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA) in 2016, prohibiting businesses from using contractual clauses or intimidation to silence consumer feedback. Leveraging millions of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, this study provides the first systematic evaluation of the CRFA’s effectiveness. We find that after the law’s enactment, U.S. hotel reviews became longer, more candid, and systematically more negative. Effects were especially strong for less reputable hotels, highly competitive markets, and experienced reviewers, pointing to where suppression had been most prevalent. Supplemental analyses confirm similar patterns using Google Places data and state-level repeals of criminal defamation laws. These findings demonstrate that regulation can effectively restore transparency and authenticity in online review platforms. For policymakers, the results provide concrete evidence that consumer-protection laws can counteract harmful business practices. For managers and platforms, they underscore the value of fostering open feedback ecosystems that promote trust and informed consumer choice.</content>

    <title>Determinants of Employee Victory in Telecommuting Labor Disputes: A Configurational Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid expansion of telecommuting during the COVID‐19 pandemic created novel disputes over remote‐work conditions that existing laws did not clearly regulate. This study investigates the configurational determinants of employee victory in these disputes. Drawing on resource‐based and institutional theories of litigation outcomes, we propose an analytical framework comprising three categories of determinants: employee resources (income, tenure, and legal representation), employer resources (enterprise size and maturity), and institutional factors (dispute type and government policy invocation). Using fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 287 first‐instance telecommuting labor‐dispute judgments from China in 2020, we identify five equifinal pathways to employee success. These pathways reveal that no single factor guarantees victory; instead, success depends on specific synergies, such as high‐income employees leveraging policy support in individual disputes or long‐tenured employees utilizing collective action against strong enterprises. These findings offer a configurational perspective on how resources and institutional factors jointly shape remote‐work litigation outcomes.</content>

    <title>The Cost of Surveillance: How Perceived Invasiveness of Electronic Performance Monitoring Triggers Workplace Cheating</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rapid expansion of emerging digital technologies, human resource practitioners are increasingly adopting advanced electronic performance monitoring (EPM) approaches to ensure employee compliance and productivity. However, they have largely overlooked that the invasive EPM may lead to unintended, reversed outcomes, such as cheating. Integrating the self‐protection model of workplace cheating and fairness heuristic theory, our research aims to delineate how and when perceived EPM invasiveness triggers employee cheating. Through a field survey and an experimental study, we obtained converging evidence supporting our model. Specifically, we find that perceived EPM invasiveness leads to cheating via anger (a self‐protection emotion) and moral disengagement (a self‐protection cognition). In addition, overall justice mitigates the harmful psychological and behavioral consequences of perceived EPM invasiveness. This research contributes to the EPM literature and provides practical guidance to organizations on the effective use of performance management tools in the digital era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bridges are critical but sparse links in land transport networks. I exploit quasi-experimental variation in bridge construction over major rivers in the United States to measure the causal effects of land transport infrastructure. Bridges are more often built upstream than downstream of tributary confluences—where smaller rivers join larger rivers—generating local differences in connectivity. These local connectivity advantages have negative effects on per capita income. In contrast, major changes in connectivity arising from the opening of major bridges increase per capita economic activity. A narrative explanation that can reconcile both results is that land transport infrastructure creates productivity advantages that drive economic growth, structural transformation, and urbanization over large spatial scales. Local sorting within the cities that form around early transport routes then reverses this gradient over smaller spatial scales.</content>

    <title>Revolutionary Sparks: Exploring the Resource Spillover Effect of Street Protests on Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research in advanced economies shows that street protests can indirectly influence untargeted firms through informational spillovers. We propose that, in developing economies, the indirect effects of street protests extend beyond information cues to include a resource spillover effect. Specifically, local officials may be motivated to defuse or redirect the momentum of street protests by appealing to constituents’ aspirations for economic well-being. This middle-ground approach sits between symbolic gestures and targeted policies directly addressing activists’ grievances and can facilitate the creation of new organizations. Using a longitudinal data set organized by city-year observations in China between 2008 and 2019, we examine how street protests over noneconomic issues impact the founding of new ventures. We find that city mayors’ response to street protests indirectly facilitates entrepreneurship by lowering business operating costs and increasing access to capital. Further, the resource spillover effect on businesses is accentuated by a political opportunity structure that enhances the impact of street protests on the responses of local politicians.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18885 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To meet sales targets with limited resources, business-to-business (B2B) service firms must prioritize promising opportunities within large pipelines. Yet, both theory and practice indicate that such decisions often rely on intuition or ad hoc rules, resulting in suboptimal sales and operations planning. Drawing on relationship management and organizational buying literature, we develop a theory-informed sales-operations framework that links buyer typology (e.g., new vs. rebid) and opportunity characteristics (e.g., size, relationship strength) to the firm’s bid and win decisions. Using archival data from a global on-site services provider encompassing 4,574 opportunities across 23 countries (2010–2021), we document a persistent trade-off: while low-risk, relationship-based opportunities yield higher win probabilities, they are insufficient to achieve regional sales goals. We address this challenge through an ensemble machine learning model that predicts win likelihood and a combinatorial optimization model that allocates bidding capacity strategically. The integrated framework improves predictive accuracy by 11% and could have increased realized sales by 21% while bidding on 38% fewer opportunities. Extensions incorporating stochastic programming and a Heckman-style two-stage correction enhance the framework’s robustness to uncertainty and data selection bias, providing managers with a rigorous, data-driven approach to opportunity management.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Does Artificial Intelligence Stimulate or Diminish Human Interactions? An Affordance Perspective on AI, Relational Coordination, and Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) can influence the way people relate and coordinate to improve performance. Our research explores how human-AI interactions affect relational coordination and operational performance. Competing views suggest that AI may augment or substitute for human capabilities. To examine conflicting views, we build on affordance theory, which suggests that the interactions between people and technology provide (i.e., afford) multiple potential actions, which could stimulate or diminish human interactions. Given the importance of human interactions during times of increasing technology use, we focus on relational coordination with its explicit emphasis on human relationships built on mutual respect and shared goals in fostering coordination. We introduce and find evidence of the concepts of convergent and divergent affordances to explain how AI affordances can result in similar or different outcomes. We perform multiple progressive, behavioral experiments in a virtual factory setting where participants work in teams with three functional roles, including operations, demand, and quality. We randomly assign individuals to one of three treatment groups that differ in the number of teammates that receive recommendations from an analytical AI based on machine learning. Through quantitative, qualitative, replication, recording, and multiphase methods, we find that human-AI interactions can stimulate relational coordination between individuals and improve team performance. We propose a theoretical framework, the ACT cycle, that explains how people interact with AI and with one another based on discussion, trust, and use of AI. Through recording and observing teams, we find evidence of various paths of interaction in that framework. We also find that discussion of AI can stimulate relational coordination, particularly in early phases of team interactions. The results provide theoretical and practical insights into how AI can stimulate relational benefits of human-technology interactions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social purpose lies at the heart of nonprofit organizations, serving as a nexus that motivates support from volunteers, donors, and other stakeholders, driving collective efforts to address social issues and anchoring everyday practices in moral imperatives that transcend organizational boundaries. Whereas a compelling social purpose is seen as vital for the survival and growth of nonprofits, we know surprisingly little about how purpose develops in these organizations. Drawing on a triadic framework that conceptualizes social purpose as narratives, shared understandings, and enactment in practice, we investigate how purpose forms and evolves within a nonprofit organization. Our findings elaborate how discrepancies can emerge between founders’ abstract, future-oriented visions and members’ practices related to the organization’s beneficiaries. These discrepancies may lead to conflicting or fragmented understandings of purpose, but they can also be generative, driving its evolution toward a resonant and achievable social impact. Whereas leaders are commonly seen as guarding organizational purpose from drift, our study shows how members in nonprofits protect purpose from irrelevance and inefficacy.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Council of Finland.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17213 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fixing AI’s “Peer Review Lottery”Getting a paper into a top AI conference can feel like a lottery, with studies showing reviewer scores are often arbitrary. Now, research from Weijie Su introduces a fix set to reform the field. The new "isotonic mechanism" tackles the crisis by asking authors to do the seemingly counter-intuitive: rank their own submissions from best to worst. The method’s effectiveness lies in its game-theoretic proof that honesty is actually the author’s best possible strategy. By harnessing this truthful self-assessment, the mechanism calibrates noisy and random reviewer scores, ensuring genuine scientific merit rises to the top. After successful large-scale experiments at major conferences, this mechanism isn’t just a theory. It’s being officially adopted by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) in 2026, promising a fairer, more reliable future for millions of AI researchers.</content>

    <title>Political Consumerism and the Emergence of Rare Information on User-Generated Content Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers are increasingly supporting businesses and brands that align closely with their values, engaging in acts of political consumerism. Despite the growing demand to support minority-owned businesses, discovering these establishments through traditional channels remains challenging. In this study, we examine whether and how online reviews facilitate the discovery of Black-owned businesses. We leverage GPS-enabled foot traffic data, hand-collected data from a directory of Black-owned restaurants, online reviews from Yelp.com, and zip code-level demographic data to understand the potential mechanisms driving this behavior. Our results suggest that Black-owned restaurants receiving reviews mentioning Black ownership as a product attribute experience about a 10% increase in foot traffic compared with those that do not receive such reviews. Furthermore, we find that reviews mentioning Black ownership primarily benefit Black-owned restaurants located in cities with lower segregation and racial isolation and those where minority ownership is not easily inferable from the kind of cuisine served. Our findings also indicate that online reviews mentioning Black ownership increase foot traffic to Black-owned restaurants by enhancing interracial exposure. Non-White consumers who patronize these restaurants experience an increased likelihood of encountering White consumers after the restaurants receive a review mentioning Black ownership. Collectively, our results demonstrate the value of user-generated content in enabling political consumerism, even without targeted interventions from digital platforms or voluntary disclosure of race by business owners.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Board Fiduciary Duty, Communication, and Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the consequences of tightening board fiduciary duty rules in a setting that combines agency frictions and strategic communication. A firm needs to tailor an investment decision (e.g., mergers and acquisitions) to the state of the world. The CEO is privately informed about the state but is an empire builder. The board can learn about the firm’s state through exerting a costly information gathering effort or through communication. In equilibrium, the board values communication more than the shareholders do. By granting the CEO a larger equity stake, the board fosters communication, and this reduces its need for costly information acquisition. Anticipating this, rational shareholders can adjust the board’s equity stake to boost its effort incentive. Surprisingly, the benefit to shareholders from stricter fiduciary duty rules is nonmonotonic in CEO agency conflicts and can diminish as the severity of agency conflict increases. Moreover, welfare analysis shows that strengthening fiduciary duty rules can weaken board effort incentives and reduce total equity value and overall welfare. Paradoxically, these efficiency losses occur when CEO agency conflicts are severe—the very situations in which stringent fiduciary duty rules are typically introduced to address such concerns. These findings suggest unintended consequences of strengthening board fiduciary duty rules and highlight the importance of taking boards as strategic, self-interested entities.This paper was accepted by Prof. Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.</content>

    <title>Are Apologies Always the Best Policy? Apologies for Service Failures Backfire When Consumers Are Not Aware of the Failure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technological advancements enable firms to anticipate service failures and apologize to consumers more effectively than ever. But are apologies always the best policy? Five experiments, including a large-scale field experiment, demonstrate that apologies backfire when consumers are not aware of the failure. Apologies decrease consumer satisfaction, trust, recommendation intentions, and repatronage behavior. This is because apologies increase awareness that a failure occurred. Accordingly, apologies backfire for both mild and severe failures so long as there is room to increase awareness of the failure. Moreover, apologies backfire more than notifications about a service failure, because although both increase awareness of the aspect of the service experience that was a failure, apologies uniquely increase awareness that this constituted a failure. Beyond increasing awareness, apologies backfire by decreasing perceived service quality and competence. However, apologies also increase perceived warmth and honesty. Consequently, apologizing can be beneficial when consumers are already aware of a failure because apologies are less likely to backfire and more likely to enhance positive perceptions of the firm. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that apologies are always the best policy when something goes wrong and provide insight into when and when not to apologize.</content>

    <title>Moving beyond the belief–behavior correlation question: Decision contexts facilitate beliefs' effects on behavior</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Specific beliefs do not correlate with seemingly relevant behaviors for many reasons. Such correlations may be low even when beliefs perfectly cause behavior (e.g., because multiple beliefs compete for influence, because beliefs have various behavioral outlets). A belief may be a necessary precursor to, but not a guarantee of, a behavior. And most critically, belief–behavior correlations may depend on the context in which behavioral decisions are made. The present article complements Lee and Albarracín's focus on how beliefs can serve as logical premises from which behavioral intentions are deduced (belief‐to‐behavior inferences) by considering how specific contexts do or do not encourage the recruitment and potential application of beliefs. Behavioral decisions can be made entirely unprompted, because the context affords a behavioral opportunity, or because a prompt requires a decision be made. These distinctions can describe naturalistic decision making and research methodologies, suggesting details of the latter can encourage misleading conclusions about a belief's behavioral relevance. Although these considerations transcend the more specific interest in correcting misinformation, a specific concern with addressing political misinformation is discussed.</content>

    <title>Collaborative Intelligence in Sequential Experiments: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Drug Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drug discovery is a complex process that involves sequentially screening and examining a vast array of molecules to identify those with the target properties. This process faces challenges because of the vast search space, the rarity of target molecules, and constraints imposed by limited data and experimental budgets. To overcome these challenges, we propose a human-centered human–algorithm collaboration framework. Notably, both the algorithm and humans have substantial knowledge gaps. The algorithm proposes, and human experts retain decision rights to approve, revise, or override. Our design artifact leverages dual-process theory for attention management, surfaces meta-knowledge as a shared state for coordination, and optimizes a joint team objective. In real-world drug discovery tasks, the human–AI team consistently outperforms all baselines, including human-only and AI-only methods. This demonstrates complementary performance. These findings illustrate that the optimal use of AI in complex decision-making environments is to augment, rather than replace, human expertise. Managers should balance AI integration with the cultivation of deep domain expertise, ensuring that technology enhances decisions without eroding uniquely human strengths. For practice and policy: preserve human agency with clear decision rights, make model uncertainty explicit, and use AI to route scarce expert attention to the most informative experiments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine administrative data with a life cycle structural model that exploits the unique features of the U.K. mortgage market to analyze the sources of inaction and to estimate borrowers’ nonpecuniary remortgaging costs. The utility costs needed to generate a given level of inaction depend on monetary gains from remortgaging and on the importance of those monetary gains for agents, which in turn depend on the (endogenously determined) marginal utility of consumption. The model results reveal significant nonpecuniary costs of action that, when measured as a proportion of borrower income, are larger for the young and for lower-income households.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. We develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for statistical arbitrage and a novel data-driven solution. First, we construct arbitrage portfolios of similar assets as residual portfolios from conditional latent asset pricing factors. Second, we extract their time-series signals with a powerful machine learning time-series solution, a convolutional transformer. Lastly, we use these signals to form an optimal trading policy, which maximizes risk-adjusted returns under constraints. Our comprehensive empirical study on daily U.S. equities shows a high compensation for arbitrageurs to enforce the law of one price. Our arbitrage strategies obtain considerable out-of-sample mean returns and Sharpe ratios, and outperform all benchmark approaches.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank MSCI for generous research support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We uncover a significant friction in small business lending: perception of risk by Small Business Administration (SBA) employees. Using novel data on SBA employees transferring across offices, we find that more current defaults on SBA loans in their previous location reduce SBA loans and job creation in their current location. The effect is independent of local economic conditions and the informational content of the nonlocal defaults, suggesting that SBA employees update their risk assessment irrationally. Our results are the first to document that regulators’ misperception of economic conditions affects the ability of small businesses to obtain access to finance.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03040 .</content>

    <title>Correlation of Rankings in Matching Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of correlation in matching markets, where multiple decision makers simultaneously face selection problems from the same pool of candidates. We propose a model in which a candidate’s priority scores across different decision makers exhibit varying levels of correlation dependent on the candidate’s sociodemographic group. Such differential correlation can arise in school choice because of the varying prevalence of selection criteria, in college admissions because of test-optional policies, or because of algorithmic monoculture, that is, when decision makers rely on the same algorithms and data sets to evaluate candidates. We show that higher correlation for one of the groups generally improves the outcome for all groups, leading to higher efficiency. However, students from a given group are more likely to remain unmatched as their own correlation level increases. This implies that it is advantageous to belong to a low-correlation group. Finally, we extend the tie-breaking literature to multiple priority classes and intermediate levels of correlation. Overall, our results point to differential correlation as a previously overlooked systemic source of group inequalities in school, university, and job admissions.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was partially supported by MIAI @ Grenoble Alpes [Grants ANR-19-P3IA-0003 and ANR-23-PEIA-0003], by the French National Research Agency (ANR) [Grants ANR-19-CE48-0018 and ANR-20-CE23-0007], and by the National Science Foundation [Grant DMS-1928930] and by the Alfred P.

    <title>Stakeholder Management and Resource Complementarities: Firm Performance amid Systemic Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stakeholder management plays a central role in shaping firms’ responses to systemic crises. However, existing research offers incomplete guidance, often examining it in isolation from firms’ internal resource positions and external crisis exposure. Drawing on a configurational perspective, we analyse a unique dataset of 2727 US firms during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic using fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Our findings indicate that both encompassing and minimalist stakeholder management approaches can lead to high performance, but only when aligned with firms’ financial and operational resources (i.e., slack and diversification) and their levels of crisis exposure. An encompassing approach proves most effective under high crisis exposure, as it enhances legitimacy and stakeholder coordination amid uncertainty. In contrast, low‐exposure firms can perform well through a minimalist approach, provided they possess ample financial slack to buffer against disruption. Our study advances stakeholder management research by moving beyond an either‐or perspective, identifying multiple equifinal configurations for achieving resilience. We highlight the causal complexity of firms’ crisis responses and advance a contingency‐based understanding of what works, for whom, and under what conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cronyism promotes the exchange of favors among connected parties based on relationships rather than merit, granting them undue advantages in securing opportunities and resources. This study examines the impact of cronyism on the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship. The analysis of data from 98 countries over 8 years (482 country-year observations) indicates that cronyism is negatively associated with the quantity of productive entrepreneurship, and positively associated with the prevalence of unproductive entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the results reveal that cronyism diminishes the quality of entrepreneurship productivity across countries. Interestingly, the findings suggest that a stronger rule of law exacerbates the detrimental effects of cronyism on entrepreneurship productivity. These results extend our understanding of cronyism as a crucial yet understudied informal institution with major implications for management and entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented Abstract (for Research Spotlight)Low-wage workers often face liquidity constraints, relying on costly short-term credit options such as payday loans. On-demand wage access (OWA) platforms offer a promising alternative by allowing workers to access earned wages before traditional pay cycles. This study examines whether OWA enhances financial engagement among low-wage workers and investigates the mechanisms driving these effects. Using transaction data from about 4,000 users of a U.S.-based OWA platform, we employ a difference-in-differences approach with staggered adoption to identify behavioral changes. To enrich our analysis, we supplement these data with evidence from an online experiment, a survey of OWA users, and semistructured interviews exploring psychological and contextual mechanisms. Our findings show that OWA adoption increases monthly saving frequency by 3.7%, time spent monitoring financial dashboards by 12.9%, and goal-setting activity by 1.3%. These effects are amplified in regions with lower minimum wages or limited banking access but weakened among users who frequently incur fees for instant withdrawals. We identify self-empowerment—beyond mere self-efficacy—as the key mechanism enabling a shift from reactive to proactive financial management. By demonstrating how digital affordances foster behavioral change within structural constraints, this research offers actionable insights for employers, OWA providers, and policymakers seeking to promote financial inclusion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human Resource Management (HRM) research focused on social care is sparse. This gap is surprising given the scale of the social care workforce in many countries, its vital role in meeting the increasingly complex needs of vulnerable community groups, and the persistent challenges in recruiting and retaining staff. Framing the special issue of articles on HRM in social care, we suggest the relative neglect stems from difficulties: defining the boundaries of the social care sector; scoping its workforce; capturing the diverse range of organizational service providers; and in a crowded research space, clarifying how HRM researchers might make a distinctive scholarly and practical contribution to the literature. The six articles comprising the special issue, together with literature from HRM and related fields, are explored through the organizational, systems, and stakeholder perspectives that underpinned the original call for articles. We develop a substantive characterization of HRM in social care comprising various parts. First, systemic features of the sector, including service fragmentation and light touch state regulation, are presented as pushing social care organizations towards opportunistic, low‐cost workforce management approaches that stakeholders—particularly employees and less directly service users—often experience negatively. Second, providers, nonetheless, retain some discretion to pursue alternative management strategies, with recent policy shifts towards networked care delivery models creating opportunities for more strategic, developmental HRM approaches. Third, leadership behavior and intrinsic employee satisfaction with care work can moderate the often‐degraded employment experience, albeit within limits, suggested by the sector's ongoing recruitment and retention difficulties. Synthesizing these insights through the systems, organizational, and stakeholder themes, we present a multi‐level analytical framework for the study of HRM issues in social care. Accompanying research questions aim to support the exploration of workforce issues by policymakers, practitioners, and HRM scholars.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend the prior operations management literature on innovation by providing large-sample empirical evidence of the differential effects of customer-base concentration on two distinct outcomes of innovation: volume and radicalness. We predict a positive association between customer-base concentration and innovation volume and a negative association between customer-base concentration and innovation radicalness. Using a sample of 16,014 firm-year observations in business-to-business industries between 1976 and 2010, we find results consistent with our predictions. Furthermore, we predict and find that a firm’s product market competition and financial resource constraints moderate the relation between customer-base concentration and innovation volume (radicalness). While prior operations management research on innovation primarily focuses on the dynamics of customers across high- vs. low-end markets, we extend this literature by demonstrating that customer-base concentration influences the nature of innovation regardless of market type and providing a better understanding of how market structures drive innovation outcomes. Firms with high customer-base concentration can use the insights from our study to allocate resources more effectively across incremental and radical innovations with the objective of ensuring their long-term survival and development.</content>

    <title>The Effects of State Government Policy on Operations Performance in the Hospital Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As malpractice liability increases, physicians order more and more diagnostic tests/procedures to avoid potential lawsuits. Given the waste/costs of defensive medical practices, some U.S. states enacted tort reform to reduce malpractice liability. As key healthcare providers, hospitals face significant malpractice liability. Despite the fact that a vast amount of medical malpractice occurs in hospitals, the effects of tort reform on hospital performance have not been studied. This study examined tort reform's effects on four hospital cost/efficiency related measures (defensive medicine (DM) costs, occupancy rate (OR), operating cost (OC), and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees/bed) and two patient-centered measures (experiential quality (EQ) and patient satisfaction (PS)). Considering both cost and quality measures enabled an examination of whether a trade-off arises under tort reform—a trade-off uniquely relevant at the hospital-level. The research applied difference-in-differences methodology to longitudinal data from multiple sources and addressed methodological weaknesses in prior studies preventing causal attribution. The results showed that tort reform reduced DM costs, with an average savings of $372 per patient stay and a savings of $238 million for an average-sized hospital, decreased hospitals’ OC, with an average savings of $664 per patient stay and $4.23 million for an average-sized hospital and is associated with 0.22 fewer FTEs per bed. However, tort reform's reduction in OR was not statistically significant. The findings indicate that conclusions drawn from single medical specialty studies do not necessarily translate to hospitals with a full spectrum of healthcare services. With respect to the patient-oriented measures, experiential quality and patient satisfaction fell by 3.53% and 5.63%, respectively. The study is particularly germane given the challenges hospitals face in meeting both the cost and quality mandates of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) Value-based Purchasing (VBP) program and provides valuable insights for policymakers (at both government and hospital levels) for improving hospital performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Price Discrimination, Regulation, and Platform Compliance: Evidence from a Field Experiment and a Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring fair platform practices has become a critical challenge in Operations Management. Increasing anecdotal evidence suggests that digital platforms may leverage consumer data to engage in data-driven price discrimination (DDPD) -- charging discriminatory prices to customers based on inferred willingness to pay. Yet, despite widespread concern, no platform has publicly acknowledged the operation of DDPD, and academic research has thus far lacked the means and empirical evidence to quantify its magnitude in practice. Against this backdrop, the first objective of this study therefore is to provide direct evidence on the presence of DDPD. To this end, we conducted a field experiment with a leading e-retailing platform in China. The results reveal that customers for whom the platform possesses more data are subject to a higher level of price discrimination. Recently, various regulations have been introduced to protect consumers from unfair use of their data, but there is a lack of evidence on platform compliance to these regulations. The second research objective is then to investigate whether and to what degree platforms complied with these regulations. We leverage a unique natural experiment in which the Chinese government implemented a new regulation banning DDPD in 2020. The findings reveal that while DDPD practice did not disappear entirely, the level decreased significantly post-regulation. As the first empirical study to present direct evidence of DDPD presence and platform compliance, the findings have significant implications for policymakers, platforms, and customers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Fan Cultivation and Monetization with Network Effects: Competing Influencers and Collaborating Brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate fan cultivation and monetization with network effects for competing influencers. Influencers are asymmetric in content-creation ability, and each influencer cooperates with a brand. They monetize their fame by charging a commission fee for selling the cooperating brand’s products to consumers. Influencers compete for fans by adjusting content quality in the fan-cultivation stage, and brands determine product prices in the monetization stage. We first study influencers maximizing only current sales profits and then incorporate long-term benefits through the word-of-mouth effect. We characterize the equilibrium of the quality-pricing game between influencers and brands and reveal how commission rates, content-creation abilities, network effect levels, and word-of-mouth strength affect influencers’ and brands’ equilibrium behavior and profits. We find that a higher revenue share of a brand does not always benefit the brand. Improving an influencer’s ability always helps the influencer-brand channel, whereas raising the commission rate may hurt the channel’s profit, depending on whether the influencer is advantaged (i.e., having a higher content-creation ability or charging a higher commission rate). From the social welfare perspective, cooperating with low-commission-rate influencers is recommended. Moreover, conducting influencer marketing with influencers who have a greater difference in content-creation ability improves social welfare. Allowing for the word-of-mouth effect, strengthening the effect improves the advantaged influencer’s content quality and may lower the disadvantaged influencer’s. Surprisingly, a stronger word-of-mouth effect may make either influencer worse off. We extend the base model by investigating a brand’s influencer cooperation strategy, cooperation with multiple influencers under a commission-and-slotting-fee (a fixed payment made to an influencer) mode, fans with correlated content preferences, and substitutable products with correlated consumer preferences sold by competing brands. These extensions confirm the robustness of the base-model findings and bring new insights. Specifically, as the network effect strengthens, the brand tends to cooperate with a more advantaged influencer. When a brand can cooperate with multiple influencers with a slotting fee, cooperating with one influencer is non-optimal when the slotting fee is low or the network effect is weak. Direct competition between correlated products may make a higher commission rate of the advantaged influencer contribute to more social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Algorithms Advance Revenue Management with Demand LearningA new study by Sentao Miao (University of Colorado Boulder), Yining Wang (University of Texas at Dallas), and Jiawei Zhang (New York University) introduces efficient algorithms for revenue management when firms face limited resources and uncertain demand. Revenue management, used in industries such as airlines, hotels, and retail, requires dynamic decisions on pricing and product assortments, whereas resources such as seats or inventory cannot be replenished. Traditional approaches often struggle with complexity or weak theoretical guarantees. The authors propose a primal-dual learning framework that combines optimization with machine learning’s upper confidence bound method. Their approach achieves near-optimal regret bounds, remaining computationally efficient even in large or infinite decision spaces. Applications include dynamic assortment selection, network revenue management with generalized linear demand, and joint pricing–assortment optimization. Numerical experiments show the methods consistently outperform benchmarks, offering practical, scalable solutions for data-driven industries.</content>

    <title>Optimized Dimensionality Reduction for Moment-Based Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most moment-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems can be reformulated as semidefinite programming (SDP) problems, which can be solved in polynomial time. However, solving high-dimensional SDPs is often time-consuming. Existing approximation methods typically reduce the dimensionality of random parameters before solving the approximated SDPs. This sequential approach relies solely on statistical information to reduce the high-dimensional uncertainty space, which may not yield the best approximation performance. Jiang et al. (2025) introduce an optimized dimensionality reduction (ODR) approach that integrates the dimensionality reduction of random parameters with subsequent optimization problems. This integration enables two outer approximations and one inner approximation of the original problem, all represented as low-dimensional SDPs that can be solved efficiently, providing two lower bounds and one upper bound, respectively. More importantly, these approximations can theoretically achieve the optimal value of the original high-dimensional SDPs, resulting in a zero gap.</content>

    <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Equilibrium Computation in Multistage Auctions and Contests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compute equilibrium strategies in multistage games with continuous signal and action spaces as they are widely used in the management sciences and economics. Examples include sequential sales via auctions, multistage elimination contests, and Stackelberg competitions. In sequential auctions, analysts performing equilibrium analysis are required to derive not just single bids but bid functions for all possible signals or values that a bidder might have in multiple stages. Because of the continuity of the signal and action spaces, these bid functions come from an infinite dimensional space. Although such models are fundamental to game theory and its applications, equilibrium strategies are rarely known. The resulting system of nonlinear differential equations is considered intractable for all but elementary models. This has been limiting progress in game theory and is a barrier to its adoption in the field. We show that deep reinforcement learning and self-play can learn equilibrium bidding strategies for various multistage games. Verifying an equilibrium in such games is challenging because of the continuous signal and action spaces. We introduce a verification algorithm and prove that the error of this verifier decreases when considering Lipschitz continuous strategies with increasing levels of discretization and sample sizes. Leveraging the novel verification algorithm, we find equilibrium in models that have not yet been explored analytically and new asymmetric equilibrium bid functions for established models of sequential auctions.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grant BI 1057/9].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge is a key resource in marketing and an assumption across literatures is that a firm must prevent valuable knowledge from leaking to competitors. This research develops a theoretical framework that calls for rethinking this view by offering a fresh perspective onwhenandhowa firm should protect marketing knowledge to minimize the likelihood harm to the firm. This framework integrates research across disciplines and interviews with executives to provide a more accurate analysis of the payoffs of knowledge protection. This is accomplished, first, by introducing a set of unintended hidden costs of the most commonly used knowledge-protection strategy—leakage prevention—that harm a firm’s competitive advantage. Firm and industry moderators that influence the magnitude and consequences of these hidden costs are outlined. Second, the framework suggests that the benefits of knowledge protection may be more limited than previously recognized. It does so by delineating the knowledge “leakage-to-harm” process and identifying competitor and industry moderators that can impede the process. Third, the framework offers a typology of alternative protection strategies firms can use to preserve their knowledge-based competitive advantage. Across these contributions, the framework calls for substantial rethinking marketing knowledge protection with important implications for marketing practice and future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Novice art pricing is an understudied domain. Novice artists operate as microenterprises, making crucial price-setting decisions. Research shows that newcomers often risk overpricing or underpricing their work, and existing online tools offer basic, cost-based pricing advice. Using a three-study framework, we examine novice art pricing on Etsy, where artwork listings include structured data, images, and textual descriptions. We first analyze how these inputs relate to final selling prices using a hedonic regression on structured data, followed by a multimodal fusion deep learning (MMF-DL) model that integrates structured, visual, and textual features. Our results show that features related to artist authenticity (e.g., certificates), customer service (e.g., shipping, returns, personalization), and art style (e.g., genre) are important price predictors. Thus, novice art sold on online platforms exhibits some features typical of mature art markets (e.g., authenticity and reputation) but emphasize customer-focused services. Finally, using a Cox proportional hazards model, we show that, while higher artist reputation is associated with faster sales, discounting correlates with longer time on market. These associations suggest the importance of price setting. From these insights, we develop a price recommender application that predicts both selling prices and time-to-sale, offering practical guidance for newcomer artists and online platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although research on ethnic diversity in advertising is extensive, its findings remain fragmented and often inconclusive. This limits practical guidance for marketers. Beyond marketing- and consumer-specific factors, differences between ethnic minority groups within a country and cross-national socioeconomic and cultural factors can play a role in shaping responses to ethnic diversity advertising of consumers belonging to either ethnic majority or minority groups. This study develops and empirically tests a theoretical framework to examine the impact of ethnic diversity in advertising along with the factors that moderate this impact. We conduct a meta-analysis based on 1,276 effect sizes derived from 106 studies published between 1969 and 2024, encompassing 155 unique datasets from 21 countries. The findings reveal that ethnic diversity effects are small, but are moderated by country-level variables such as migration rates and rule of law, in addition to product, advertising, and consumer characteristics and that some of these moderator effects work differently for ethnic minority compared to majority consumers. Furthermore, within the U.S. context, the sociopolitical power position of ethnic minorities enhances advertising effectiveness among majority consumers. These insights offer implications for both researchers and practitioners.</content>

    <title>Stereotypes as Strategic Assets: How Expatriates Navigate Discrimination to Build Advantage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreigners are often subject to stereotyping and discrimination, challenges typically associated with negative outcomes in the literature. In contrast, this study explores the potential benefits of such experiences for expatriates. Using an abductive approach, informed by self-categorization theory and impression management theory, we draw on interviews with 102 German expatriates in China, Korea, and Japan to examine 1) the stereotyping and resulting preferential discrimination expatriates experience abroad and 2) how expatriates strategically utilize stereotypes to their advantage. Our findings reveal that both positive and negative stereotypes can lead to preferential discrimination. Expatriates may benefit from immediate trust, privileged access to decision-makers, and what is often referred to as a “foreigner bonus.” Rather than passively accepting stereotyping, expatriates actively leveraged it through three strategies—trustworthy actor, powerful messenger, cultural clueless foreigner—to gain individual and organizational benefits. These strategic performances were often encouraged by local colleagues and superiors. By uncovering how expatriates engage in stereotypical behavior to enhance outcomes, this study reframes foreignness as a valuable asset that can be performed situationally and relationally. This perspective offers valuable managerial implications and advances theoretical understanding of cross-cultural interactions.</content>

    <title>What, Why, and How: An Empiricist’s Guide to Double/Debiased Machine Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an introduction to double/debiased machine learning (DML), a framework that enables effect estimation when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data. In many empirical analyses, especially in fields such as information systems, researchers face difficult choices about which control variables to include and how to model their relationships with the outcome. These modeling decisions can significantly change results, leading to uncertainty about which findings are reliable. DML offers a practical solution by combining modern machine learning with rigorous statistical inference. The idea is to let flexible ML models (such as random forests or gradient boosting) capture complex relationships among control variables while still delivering reliable estimates for the key effect of interest. DML can be applied to many familiar research designs, including standard regression with controls, instrumental variables, difference in differences, and models that incorporate ML-generated features. Empirical studies and simulations show that DML is typically more robust to misspecification than traditional regression and more reliable than earlier semiparametric methods. However, DML is not automatic—it still requires sound research design and high-quality machine learning estimation. Used thoughtfully, DML provides a powerful, flexible, and statistically grounded approach for empirical research in modern data environments.</content>

    <title>Atlas Unplugged: Re‐Imagining the Premises and Prospects of Capitalism for Business and Society</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand’s dystopian work of fiction, became a cornerstone of libertarian philosophy and its influence continues as an articulation of contemporary capitalism. In introducing this Special Issue, we revisit its core assumptions and contradictions in order to reimagine capitalism and reflect on the potential of management studies to contribute alternatives. These aspirations are reflected in the contributions. They discuss Indigenous views of capitalism, the ethics of care, insights from self‐determination theory, the logic of marketization, and how capitalist institutions foster violence, racism, inequality, and environmental crisis. Building from these insights, we discuss the potential for future research to draw on a combined critical lens ofplaceandintersectionalityin developing systemic analyses of capitalism. Place situates action in its meaningful social and geographical spaces, recognizing the specific historical, political, and community relations through which global forces are (re‐)produced and experienced. Intersectionality interrogates the capitalist system through various axes of identity to understand its consequences and inequalities. We use this framing to assess key aspects of contemporary capitalism: labour markets, globalization and global value chains, and access to resources. We then reflect on the prospects for alternative imaginings of capitalism and how management research might contribute to these.</content>

    <title>Counter‐Stigmatization in the Digital Age: The Case of the Sex Tech Award Incident</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have shown considerable interest in how organizations manage stigma when powerful actors discredit them and their products. However, research has paid less attention to how organizations might deflect stigma back onto their stigmatizers. This is a distinct possibility in today’s digital age, where social evaluations are rapidly disseminated, emotionally charged, and widely distributed. We investigate this dynamic in this paper, focusing on how stigmatized organizations can counter‐stigmatize their stigmatizers despite an imbalance of power. Drawing on a longitudinal case of a sex tech start‐up whose innovation award was rescinded by a major technology trade show, we identify the triggers, mechanisms, and outcomes of counter‐stigmatization. The model that we offer contributes to research on stigmatization as a process. Specifically, we theorize how digitally mediated counter‐stigmatization reshapes power dynamics, how event and core stigma become intertwined within this process, and how emotions drive counter‐stigmatization.</content>

    <title>Are boards reluctant to remove poorly performing successors to interim CEOs?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interim CEO appointments are disruptive and costly to firms. Boards justify them as necessary to find the right permanent successor. But what happens if that successor performs poorly? This paper argues that directors may be reluctant to remove a poorly performing successor to an interim CEO early in their tenure. It posits that this may be owing to directors' concerns for their own reputations or for the firm. Results demonstrate that successors to interim CEOs are considerably less likely than successors to permanent CEOs to experience performance‐related early departures. This appears to be owing to directors' efforts to avoid further harming the firm. Additional analyses suggest these concerns may be justified, as early exits by successors to interim CEOs are associated with post‐succession market declines.Managerial SummaryWhen faced with an unexpected CEO departure, appointing an interim CEO is often viewed as a prudent decision to ensure the selection of the right permanent successor. Yet interim appointments are disruptive and can have lasting consequences. This study finds that when a permanent successor follows an interim CEO, directors appear reluctant to remove them early for poor performance. This reluctance appears to be driven primarily by directors' concerns about causing further harm to the firm rather than their concerns that removing the successor early may damage their reputations as governance professionals. Additional analyses indicate that these concerns for the well‐being of the firm may be justified, as early exits by successors to interim CEOs are associated with post‐succession declines in market performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beyond One Policy: A New Framework for Comparing Multiple InterventionsTraditional methods for policy evaluation typically focus on a single intervention. Yet many real-world settings feature multiple, often concurrent, interventions—making it crucial to understand their comparative effects. In “Synthetic Interventions: Extending Synthetic Controls to Multiple Treatments,” Agarwal, Shah, and Shen introduce the synthetic interventions framework, a generalization of the synthetic controls method that accommodates multiple treatments within a unified model. By representing outcomes as a low-rank tensor capturing relationships across time, units, and interventions, their approach enables researchers to estimate counterfactual outcomes under all interventions for each unit. The authors establish consistency of their estimator and show that a bias-corrected version achieves asymptotic normality, permitting valid statistical inference. This work offers a new perspective for evaluating complex, multipolicy environments where traditional causal inference tools fall short.</content>

    <title>Economic Uncertainty and the Beta Anomaly</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using various measures of economic uncertainty, we find that the beta-alpha anomaly exists only during periods of low economic uncertainty. We argue that diminished risk appetite during high economic uncertainty eases leverage constraints of typical long-only investors, making overvaluation of high-beta stocks and undervaluation of low-beta stocks less likely. Differences in uncertainty-related beta trading activities between mutual fund investors/managers and hedge funds support this explanation. Variation of the beta anomaly within the low-uncertainty state further corroborates it: the anomaly is significant (insignificant) in stocks heavily held by actively managed mutual funds (hedge funds), and it is concentrated in the subperiods in which leverage constraints for long-only investors are likely to be more severe.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: Z.

    <title>Corporate Tax Avoidance and Sales: Microevidence and Aggregate Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the effect of corporate tax avoidance (CTA) on U.S. firm-level sales and its aggregate implications. In theory, CTA gives a competitive edge to avoiding firms, which affects the distribution of sales in the economy. In practice, we find a causal impact of CTA on firm-level sales using a broad set of measures of tax avoidance and different identification strategies. Combining microestimates and the model, we assess how changes in CTA over the past two decades have shaped the distribution of sales across U.S. industries. Although the effects vary by sector, rising CTA among large firms has reinforced their dominant positions, contributing to increased concentration, in several key industries.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Funding: Financial support from the ENS Paris-Saclay Booster’s program, from the SSHRC [Insight Development Grant 207-2018-2019-Q1-00406], from the UQAM research chair on the local impact of multinationals, and from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique – FNRS [Grant No. F.4533.23] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05773 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Channel restructuring is a firm’s redesign and optimization of its channel system to serve markets more effectively. Restructuring demands significant investments of time, capital, and managerial attention, as firms must reconfigure processes, renegotiate agreements with channel partners, and manage the operational disruptions that inevitably accompany structural change. As even the most rigorously planned restructuring efforts can falter if partners do not buy in, it is paramount that firms secure the compliance of partners they seek to retain in the revised channel system. Prior research lacks a comprehensive and integrated conceptualization of channel restructuring, the available restructuring options, and the implications of restructuring for the firm’s downstream channel partners. We offer a channel restructuring typology comprising six restructuring types and delineate the functional role, status, and financial implications of each type for the firm’s partners. We provide theoretically grounded, testable propositions regarding the impact of restructuring on partner compliance. This paper offers scholars guidance for empirical investigation. It also highlights factors that practitioners should consider when designing and implementing channel restructuring to achieve both operational efficiencies and sustain partner relationships.</content>

    <title>Institutions and social entrepreneurship: a hierarchy of institutions to revisit institutional voids, support, and configurations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this retrospective, we expand on theorizing about institutions and social entrepreneurship (SE) as presented in our Decade Award-winning 2015 article. Our 2015 paper developed the institutional configuration perspective, which considers joint and interaction effects of formal and informal institutions. It organized disagreement about how formal institutions shape SE, contrasting the institutional voids and institutional support perspectives. In this retrospective, we introduce a revised hierarchy of institutions as a ‘middle-ground’ approach to advance research on institutions in international business and entrepreneurship. This hierarchy integrates insights from different disciplines (institutional economics, sociology, political science, and cultural theory). It explicates the macro-level economic and microfoundational psychological effects of four layers of formal (government activism and constitutional institutions/rule of law) and informal institutions (cultural values and norms). The hierarchy progresses research on institutional voids by distinguishing four types of formal and informal institutional voids. It advances research on institutional configurations by highlighting new synergistic and compensatory configurations. It also offers new insights into institutional change. Finally, we advance research on institutions and SE by theorizing a new institutional paradox for SE that reconciles the institutional void versus support debate and by charting opportunities for how institutions shape the SE process from entry to exit.</content>

    <title>Brief Commentary: Is “4 for $16” Better than “4 for $15.30”? Testing the Replicability of the Price Divisibility Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although higher prices generally lead to lower demand, research on the price divisibility effect suggests that consumers are sometimes willing to pay more for a multipack if its price is divisible by the number of units it contains. For instance, a 7-pack of shoelaces might be more appealing at the divisible price of $14 than at the lower, but non-divisible, price of $13. The original Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) article documenting this phenomenon presented a total of 15 studies, one of which was preregistered and all of which yielded strong evidence. In this article, we report four preregistered replications of three key studies from the original article. Despite our replications’ considerably larger sample sizes, none replicated the original results, and one yielded a marginally significant effect in the opposite direction. We consider several possible reasons for the discrepancies (e.g., selective reporting, data anomalies, time-related or context-related moderators) and discuss their theoretical and practical implications. Altogether, our findings imply that the price divisibility effect may not exist; if it does exist, it is not as robust or generalizable as originally claimed. Researchers and marketers should exercise caution before attempting to extend or apply research on the price divisibility effect.</content>

    <title>Brief Commentary: A Reexamination of the Effect of Forced Choice on Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When conducting studies in which the dependent variable is choice, researchers must decide whether to require participants to select one of the available alternatives or to provide a no-choice option. Prior research by Dhar and Simonson (2003) proposed that no-choice options can disproportionately reduce the share of certain alternatives, particularly all-average or compromise options. In this commentary, I reexamine the propositions and findings of Dhar and Simonson. I report the results of nine well-powered, pre-registered replications of their studies, which support only a subset of the authors’ hypotheses. Importantly, across the replication studies, no-choice options do not systematically draw share from specific alternatives. These findings suggest that no-choice effects may be more nuanced than previously thought and that the conditions under which previously documented effects occur reliably remain unclear. I discuss the implications of these results for theories of decision-making, context effects, and choice deferral. This work aims to update the literature and inform marketing researchers about the consequences of forcing choice versus allowing a no-choice option in experimental designs.</content>

    <title>Insiders Only: Are Our Ideas About What Makes “Good Theory” Holding Us Back?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer researchers often prize relevance but overlook how narrow assumptions about good theory limit it. Much of the work focuses on construct-to-construct theorizing, which involves introducing new constructs or new links among them. Far less valued is phenomenon-to-construct theorizing, which begins with real-world patterns and seeks to explain them by identifying the underlying active ingredient constructs. Examples include why GMO labels reduce demand, or why drip pricing leads people to choose higher-cost options. Our survey of authors in four leading journals shows that most believe only construct-to-construct work counts as theory. We argue this view is too narrow. Drawing on a Bayesian framework for updating beliefs within a theoretical network, we show that phenomenon-to-construct theorizing follows the same logic of scientific inference. Both approaches rely on established links in the nomological network to draw stronger conclusions about the focal link of interest. Using well-supported construct-to-construct mechanisms to explain real-world phenomena is therefore a strength, not a weakness. We clarify how phenomenon-to-construct theorizing differs from both “mere application” and “empirics-first” research. Embracing this form of theorizing can broaden the reach of consumer research by connecting abstract ideas to meaningful, actionable phenomena that matter to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capital flows increase in response to new public information. Conventional explanations typically conclude that this reflects a rational response to reduced risk. However, investors may also be overconfident in their ability to benefit from new information, even when it is publicly available and does not provide a relative advantage. We exploit two complementary settings to examine how this “better‐than‐average” mechanism affects capital flows. Archival evidence from horse race betting markets shows capital flows increase following the public provision of a summary measure of horse performance, even though more total parimutuel wagering necessarily implies a greater wealth transfer from bettors to tracks. A controlled lab experiment provides direct causal evidence of our proposed mechanism. Combined, our results suggest that new public information can increase capital flows due to investors’ overconfidence in their ability to benefit from information relative to others. Our findings inform regulators seeking to understand the consequences of expanding the public information available to individual investors.</content>

    <title>Knowing (Not) to Know: Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Human Metacognition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many organizations seek to combine human expertise with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), but they often overlook a core requirement for effective collaboration; humans must understand their own abilities. This understanding of one’s own abilities is referred to as metacognition, which captures how well individuals monitor and regulate their own decision making. In two experiments with real estate and lending professionals, we find that XAI improves human metacognition by reducing their overconfidence. As a result, experts can better delegate decisions to an artificial intelligence (AI) and interact with it more effectively, improving the collaborative performance. These effects occur primarily when XAI highlights differences between human reasoning and AI logic. Our findings demonstrate that metacognition is a key mechanism through which XAI affects decision outcomes and offer guidance for organizations deploying (X)AI under growing transparency and accountability mandates, such as those in the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act.</content>

    <title>Social Class Signals in Recruitment: Investigating When and Why Signal Relevance and Job's Customer Contact Requirement Shape Hiring Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People may infer others' social class based on signals such as clothing, accents, university attended, or leisure activities. In recruitment and selection, such incidental social class signaling by candidates may occur, as information like this is often shared by candidates in application materials. Whether or how the visibility of candidates' social class information influences candidate evaluations, however, remains poorly understood. Building on signaling theory, we propose that social class level influence hiring decisions most when they contain job‐relevant content, particularly in roles that directly influence an organization's image to external stakeholders. We followed a three‐step, multi‐study approach: (1) developing stimulus materials in the form of interview response transcripts; (2) conducting two validation studies (N= 100 andN= 108, respectively), and (3) conducting a pre‐registered online vignette main study (N= 226). Results reveal that candidates with higher‐class signals were favored only when the class signals conveyed job‐relevant content. This class effect was most pronounced in roles that directly influence an organization's image, operationalized as high customer contact positions. Moreover, our findings show that perceptions of job fit, rather than cultural fit with the organization, drove these biased hiring evaluations. This study enhances our understanding of job‐level variations of social class bias in recruitment and underscores the importance of aligning job requirements closely with the role‐relevant core competencies to foster more equitable hiring practices.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Pricing and Demand Learning in Decentralized Supply Chains: Implications for Product Quality and Firm Profits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In modern consumer technology industries, manufacturers make substantial upfront investments in product quality, despite facing significant demand uncertainty—particularly regarding the size of the high-valuation segment that values quality highly. Dynamic pricing, where retailers adjust prices based on demand learning in the early period, may help mitigate this uncertainty. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine how a retailer’s dynamic pricing capability impacts a manufacturer’s wholesale pricing and product quality investment and whether it benefits both firms. In our model, the retailer can learn the proportion of high-valuation consumers by setting a high early price to target only that segment. This demand learning opportunity affects the manufacturer’s wholesale pricing strategy and its expected return on quality investment. We find that the retailer’s dynamic pricing improves product quality when the market is moderately likely to be good but has no effect when a good market is nearly certain. Dynamic pricing can also lead to either win-win or lose-lose outcomes: it benefits both firms when it mitigates double marginalization and enables broader market coverage, but harms both when it induces inefficient premium pricing and reduces total demand. We extend our main model to several settings, including cases where both firms have dynamic pricing capabilities and where consumer valuations follow a continuous distribution. While our main qualitative insights remain robust, we uncover several new findings. For example, when both firms (rather than only the retailer) can adjust prices dynamically, dynamic pricing is more likely to enhance product quality and increase the manufacturer’s profits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates the operational and competitive effects of Price Transparency Regulation (PTR) in healthcare through both theoretical and empirical lenses. We leverage the launch of Maine’s price transparency website as a natural experiment and construct a Difference-in-Differences model to identify causal effects. Our analysis links patient flow patterns, negotiation dynamics, and revenue management strategies, offering a unique opportunity to unpack the multifaceted impacts of PTR. We quantify three mechanisms. First, PTR reshapes patient flow: with access to price information, patients become more price sensitive and switch to lower-cost providers, explaining nearly half of the observed 2.74–percentage point reduction in average prices. Second, PTR reduces negotiated claim prices by intensifying market competition (the competition effect) while also interacting with non-competitive factors such as provider bargaining power. Competitive factors, particularly insurer size and provider appeal, explain 80.7% of these supply-side reductions, while non-competitive factors account for the remaining. Third, the benefits are unevenly distributed: larger insurers capture greater reductions, while providers with strong patient appeal or broad service portfolios preserve pricing leverage. Together, these findings show that PTR reduces costs through both consumer switching and negotiation dynamics but also amplifies existing market imbalances, privileging larger stakeholders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online product reviews play a pivotal role in empowering consumers by reducing uncertainty about product attributes, a phenomenon widely studied from the demand perspective. However, the supply-side implications remain less understood—particularly how firms can leverage consumer reviews to develop an integrated pricing–quality strategy. To address this gap, we examine a firm’s dynamic pricing and product-quality decisions over two selling periods, where consumer reviews play a central role in shaping the market’s perception of a new experience good. Both the firm and its consumers are initially uncertain about the product’s perceived (market-based) quality and rely on early reviews to update their beliefs. Our analysis identifies two critical review metrics—volumeandvalence—as jointly shaping the firm’s optimal strategy. Review volume reflects initial sales, while valence measures the average rating. Together, these metrics generate what we call thelearning precision effect, whereby review information enhances the accuracy of quality inference and, in turn, guides the firm’s dynamic pricing and quality decisions. We find that, without the option to refine (adjust) quality after launch, the firm prefers a higher initial product quality and a lower introductory price to boost review volume and improve learning. When post-launch quality refinement is feasible, the learning precision effect intensifies, as the firm further increases initial quality to enhance learning from reviews. However, the resulting optimal pricing strategy in the first period can depart from conventional intuition. Depending on market conditions, the firm may either raise or lower the introductory price—relative to the case without quality refinement—in order to enhance review generation. A notable outcome is that the firm’s optimal strategy not only increases its overall profit but also improves consumer surplus for both early and late buyers. Although quality refinement is often expected to favor the firm at consumers’ expense, our results show that learning from reviews can generate a genuine win–win outcome. Finally, we extend our model to incorporate under-reporting bias, uninformed consumers, nonzero marginal quality costs, and alternative distributions of perceived quality, and find that our main insights remain robust across these variations.</content>

    <title>Transactive Memory Systems and Hospital Trauma Team Performance: Shared Experience in Action Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify and test a theoretical mechanism linking shared team experience and team performance: a transactive memory system (TMS). Our empirical context is the care of patients with severe acute traumatic injury in a hospital emergency department. We coded behavioral indicators of transactive memory from video recordings of trauma resuscitations in a hospital emergency department. We obtained objective measures of team performance—patient lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital—from hospital records, as well as information about the experience of team members. Our results of analyzing data from 121 patients reveal that patients treated by trauma teams with strong TMS experience significantly shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital than patients treated by trauma teams with weaker TMS. The magnitude of the effects was large: Increasing TMS by one standard deviation was associated with a reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS) of 3.3 days and a reduction in ICU LOS of 1.9 days. Experience working together predicted the strength of the team’s transactive memory over and above the effect of individual experience. Further, transactive memory mediated or explained the effect of team experience on team performance. These results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses in which we varied our definition of team experience and our modeling approach and included controls for team, task, and context characteristics. We discuss the implications of these findings for strengthening TMS in trauma resuscitation teams and for theories on transactive memory and organizational learning.Funding: This work was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Grant R35HL144804] and the Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation and Knowledge at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19022 .</content>

    <title>Dynamic Portfolio Choice with Intertemporal Hedging and Transaction Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When returns are partially predictable and trading is costly, utility-maximizing investors track a target portfolio at a constant trading speed. The target portfolio is optimal for a frictionless market, where asset returns are scaled back to account for trading costs and volatilities are adjusted to proxy the “execution risk” of holding assets that are costly to trade and exposed to volatile states. The trading speed solves an optimal execution problem, which describes how the legacy portfolio inherited from the past is traded toward the target portfolio in an optimal manner. Unlike for period-by-period mean-variance preferences, the target portfolio hedges changes in investment opportunities, and both it and the trading speed are linked and depend on execution risk. We set the problem out first in an “absolute” framework—price shocks independent of the price level, and investors have CARA preferences—and then in a “relative” framework, with price shocks scaled by price levels and CRRA preferences. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in a model where market return predictions are based on a short-term momentum and a long-term value signal.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of employee health for the restructuring of the labor force during private equity buyouts using employee-level data of 56,000 Dutch buyout employees. We find no evidence that buyouts have a negative impact on the health of buyout employees. Employees lose income and employment after buyouts, and these losses are far larger for employees in poorer health. The negative effect of buyouts on employees’ incomes is buffered by social transfers, and this buffer is larger for employees in poorer health, who exit the labor market at a much higher rate. Health characteristics associated with lower wages in the general population are strongly predictive of job loss after buyouts.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [Projects MA 3317/3-1 and MA 3317/3-2].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01874 .</content>

    <title>Long-Term Pay for Performance: Cumulative Evidence over CEO Tenure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study revisits the CEO pay-for-performance relation using two methodological innovations designed to address well-known measurement challenges. First, we aggregate pay and performance over the CEO’s entire tenure, allowing us to account for ex post settling up in pay. Second, we use realized compensation rather than ex ante estimates to better capture the actual economic rewards that CEOs receive. We find strong evidence of pay for performance in the full sample with a magnitude 2–10 times greater than that reported in previous studies. However, the pay-for-performance relation is asymmetric. CEOs who outperform their peer firms exhibit strong pay-for-performance sensitivity; those who underperform do not. This asymmetry arises because boards offset weak performance with incremental equity grants, undoing the mechanical correlation that results from declining stock prices. Finally, we show that underperforming CEOs are significantly more likely to be dismissed, suggesting that turnover, rather than lower pay, could be a disciplinary mechanism used by boards. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that tenure-aggregated realized pay better reveals how boards structure incentives and accountability over the full horizon of a CEO’s leadership.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge financial support from Columbia Business School, Columbia University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04322 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The “Dark Is Hardworking” Association: How Skin Tone Affects Perceptions of Service Providers in India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Colorism, or discrimination based on skin tone, has been widely documented as privileging lighter and disadvantaging darker skin tones in personal and professional contexts. In contrast to this, the current research uncovers a novel and positive “dark is hardworking” association in India. This association is theorized based on sociological accounts linking dark skin to outdoor labor, personal accounts of dark skin-toned individuals overcoming discrimination to achieve success, and widespread media cues featuring dark skin-toned achievers in arduous career pursuits. Darker skin tone thus cuesperceived competenceof service providers, driven by perceptions of being more hardworking. Evidence from six studies— including five experiments and a behavioral field study— demonstrates that while lighter skin continues to be advantageous in attractiveness-favoring professions (such as beauty consulting), darker skin offers a distinct advantage to service providers in competence-favoring fields (such as financial and technical services). Furthermore, highlighting competence can increase the preference for darker skin-toned professionals, even in attractiveness-favoring domains. This research contributes to the literature on stigmatized groups- specifically, colorism and its effects on stereotyped evaluation of service providers. The findings provide strategic insights for service providers and have implications for social policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform endorsement is becoming increasingly popular and plays a critical role in online healthcare platforms by aiding patient choices and shaping doctors’ decisions. Using a unique dataset from a major Chinese online doctor consultation platform, this study applies a generalized synthetic control method to examine the impact of endorsement on patient demand, doctor service pricing, quantity, and quality. The findings show that endorsement significantly increases the price and quantity of paid services, while reducing free services among endorsed doctors. Despite handling higher service volumes, endorsed doctors maintain or improve quality. The endorsement program generates greater revenue for endorsed doctors and the platform, but it raises concerns about equity in healthcare access due to reduced free service provision for underprivileged patients. The analysis further reveals that the impact of endorsement varies between initial endorsement and re-endorsement as well as between high-prosocial and low-prosocial doctors. These findings underscore the nuanced role of information disclosure in shaping doctor behavior and patient access, offering important implications for platform design.</content>

                    Collaborations: Implications for Leaders’ Moral Relativism and Unethical Behaviour</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As collaborations between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly prevalent across various industries, the role of leaders in managing these collaborations has grown in importance. While the existing literature has highlighted the benefits of leader management in these settings – emphasizing the complementary strengths of humans and AI – the potential costs to key stakeholders, particularly to leaders themselves, have been largely ignored. This research addresses this gap by drawing on moral relativism theory to develop and test a model explaining how leader management of human–AI collaborations may induce leaders’ moral relativism and, in turn, result in unethical behaviour at work. Furthermore, we identify leaders’ need for cognitive closure as a crucial individual difference that negatively moderates these effects. Findings from a critical‐incident experiment, two scenario‐based experiments, and one field survey conducted with samples from both Western and Eastern cultures (i.e., the United States and China) support our model.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the digital era, organizations are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize their operations and decision‐making. However, the opaqueness of AI processes raises concerns over trust, fairness, and autonomy, especially in the gig economy, where AI‐driven management is ubiquitous. This study investigates how explainable AI (xAI), through the comparative use of counterfactual versus factual and local versus global explanations, shapes gig workers’ acceptance of AI‐driven decisions and management relations, drawing on cognitive load theory. Using experimental data from 1107 gig workers, we found that both counterfactual (relative to factual) and local (relative to global) explanations increase the acceptance of AI decisions. However, the combination of local and counterfactual explanations can overwhelm workers, thereby reducing these positive effects. Furthermore, worker acceptance mediated the relationship between xAI explanations and management relations. A follow‐up study using a simplified scenario and additional procedural controls confirmed the robustness of these effects. Our findings underscore the value of carefully tailored xAI in fostering equitable, transparent, and constructive organizational practices in digitally mediated work environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Comparing mortgage rates that borrowers obtain to rates that lenders could offer for the same loan, we find that many homeowners significantly overpay for their mortgage, with overpayment varying across borrower types and with market interest rates. Survey data reveal that borrowers' mortgage knowledge and shopping behavior strongly correlate with the rates they secure. We also document substantial variation in how expensive and profitable lenders are, without any evidence that expensive loans are associated with a better borrower experience. Despite many lenders operating in the U.S. mortgage market, limited borrower sophistication may provide lenders with market power.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theories of competition typically predict a positive relationship between market concentration and prices. However, in loan markets, adverse selection can reverse this relationship as riskier borrowers become more likely to receive funding. Using supervisory data, we show that interest rates, borrower risk, and lending volume are higher in markets with more banks. We also create a novel measure of markup that is orthogonal to borrower risk, and find that, consistent with adverse selection, markups are higher after repeated borrowing relationships. Finally, we use a shock to large banks' lending costs to provide further support for the adverse selection channel.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how initial public offerings (IPOs) affect firms' internal organization. We find that IPO firms become more hierarchical and standardized organizations, characterized by additional layers, more managers, smaller control spans, and larger administrative functions. These changes occur mostly in preparation for the IPO and can be only partially explained by growth. IPO firms with greater human capital risk experience larger hierarchical changes. Hierarchical changes help firms standardize employee roles and formalize internal processes. Our results suggest that firms reorganize to reduce their dependence on key individuals' human capital when transitioning to public markets.</content>

    <title>The nonlinear effect of consumer embarrassment on avoidance: A meta‐analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite longstanding assumptions that embarrassment leads to avoidance, empirical findings remain inconsistent. This meta‐analysis synthesizes 152 independent samples (N= 64,374) to clarify when and how embarrassment motivates avoidance. Drawing on Protection Motivation Theory, we find a curvilinear effect, where avoidance is strongest in moderately intense, embarrassing situations, but diminishes when embarrassment is either too weak to prompt concern or so intense that the consequences of avoidance become too severe to risk. This pattern underscores that avoidance is most likely when individuals perceive a moderate threat and believe avoidance is effective. Moderator analyses reveal that this effect is stronger for product‐related vs. medical contexts, when others are present, when embarrassment is anticipated (vs. experienced), and in collectivist cultures. Comparisons with guilt and shame further demonstrate that embarrassment operates through distinct, socially driven appraisals. These findings reconcile inconsistent findings in the embarrassment literature and offer guidance for reducing harmful avoidance by aligning threat and coping appraisals to promote engagement with socially sensitive behaviors. Implications for theory and practice, as well as future research priorities, are discussed.</content>
