    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Belief change does not always lead to behavior change. This belief–behavior gap has received considerable atention, particularly in the context of misinformation. We expand upon ideas in the literature by offering additional insight derived from research on attitudes. Specifically, we propose that lessons from attitudes research can be applied to the belief–behavior relationship to further understand when belief change will and will not promote behavior change. We discuss the role of attitudes in determining how beliefs shape behavior, the value of measuring and targeting attitudes in research on behavior change, and factors that can influence theattitude–behaviorrelationship as a means to gain insight into thebelief–behaviorrelationship. As part of our review, we also offer recommendations as to how belief‐targeting interventions might be improved to increase their impact on downstream behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the structure of public firm buyouts in a model that features the Berle-Means problem (lack of incentives) and the Grossman-Hart problem (holdout). We find that bootstrapping, debt in excess of funding needs, and upfront fees to bidders are socially optimal and increase buyout premiums. These elements make LBO financing tantamount to a “management contract” arranged by an outside manager to receive cash and incentives to manage a firm—except the cash is funded by excess debt imposed on the firm. Our model also rationalizes why PE firms collect fees from their equity partnerships and directly from target firms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Introduction of online degree programs: A competitive framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Educational services contribute $315.65 billion to the U.S. GDP, with online education representing the fastest-growing segment. This paper examines how operational and market factors influence universities’ decisions to introduce online degree programs. We study the strategic introduction of such programs in a vertically differentiated market, where universities differ in online program rankings (quality) and compete for a diverse student population with varying willingness to pay for perceived quality. Our analysis focuses on a simultaneous market entry scenario, yielding robust insights that also hold under alternative settings–such as when universities are equally ranked or differ in their variable costs of technology. We also examine two additional contexts: (1) a mixed competition setting in which one university operates independently while the other is guided by a social planner, and (2) an incumbent–entrant setting in which a university considers launching an online program when its competitor has already entered the market.Our findings reveal that symmetric market entry–where both universities introduce online programs–is more likely when technology integration costs exceed a certain threshold and student valuation heterogeneity is significant. In contrast, when these costs fall below the threshold, asymmetric equilibria arise in which only one university introduces an online program. When a social planner regulates tuition at the lower-ranked university, it faces tighter constraints on entering the market. However, when the higher-ranked university is subject to tuition regulation, broader market coverage and improved social welfare outcomes are achieved. Additionally, lower-ranked universities can strategically enter by targeting lower-end segments through moderate technology investments and competitive pricing. Yet, the entry of a higher-ranked rival can exert downward pressure on tuition fees for both institutions, promoting a more accessible educational environment. These insights offer strategic guidance for universities navigating quality-based competition and provide policy implications for balancing competitive dynamics with educational equity through regulatory interventions.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: AI and Operations: A Foundational Framework of Emerging Research and Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape operations across industries. Yet its real-world impact reveals a jagged and uneven implementation frontier. To make sense of this emerging landscape, we develop a foundational framework that synthesizes research and practice at the intersection of AI and Operations Management (OM), anchored in three interdependent pillars: (1) AI for OM, (2) OM for AI, and (3) Human–AI Interaction. First, AI for OM analyzes how AI enhances core operational processes, including design, procurement, production, and delivery. Second, OM for AI argues that scaling AI safely and effectively stands to benefit from core OM principles, including workflow design, capacity management, process control, drift detection, and continuous improvement, all of which are central to AI development and deployment. Third, Human–AI Interaction emphasizes the role of trust, incentives, and organizational design in mediating how humans and machines learn from and collaborate with each other. This triadic framework provides a foundation for organizing research on AI and OM and offers practical guidance for integrating AI into business and societal systems.</content>

    <title>Stripping the Discount Curve—A Robust Machine Learning Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a robust, flexible, and easy-to-implement method for estimating the yield curve from treasury securities. Our nonparametric method learns the discount curve in a function space that we motivate by economic principles. We show in an extensive empirical study on U.S. Treasury securities that our method strongly dominates all parametric and nonparametric benchmarks. It achieves substantially smaller out-of-sample yield and pricing errors while being robust to outliers and data selection choices. We attribute the superior performance to the optimal trade-off between flexibility and smoothness, which positions our method as the new standard for yield curve estimation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01401 .</content>

    <title>Social Media Is a Threat for Democracy! A Political Perspective for Analysing and Diminishing Harm</title>
    <updated>2025-12-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms, once hailed as potential champions of dialogue, have evolved into commodified spaces in which their business models incentivize hate speech, misinformation, polarization, and the political fragmentation of society, benefiting corporate and political elites while eroding democracy. The existing market and technological conceptualizations of social media platforms offer only partial analysis of and solutions to these issues. This paper advances a political perspective grounded in deliberative democracy, arguing that social media companies are political actors responsible for maintaining a well‐functioning public sphere. We argue that transforming social media platforms into true facilitators of democratic discourse requires enhancing theirdeliberative capacity. Beyond the capacities of the public sphere suggested by the market and technology perspectives (1) transparency and accountability and (2) openness and inclusiveness, we propose that fostering deliberative capacity also requires (3) conduciveness to argumentation and (4) consequentiality. We thus contribute to understanding how management theories can explain and address current threats to democracy.</content>

    <title>Modes of Reasoning in Management and Organization Studies: Promises and Perils of Abduction and Induction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Debates about theorizing in management and organization studies have at their core the question of how scholars mobilize different modes of reasoning. The principles ofdeductionandinductionhave long structured methodological discussions. The third way –abduction– derived from Peirce’s conception of ‘inference to the best explanation’, has gained traction in debates about how to generate novel and original theoretical insights. ThisPoint–Counterpointdebate focusses on the promises and perils of abduction vis‐à‐vis induction as modes of reasoning. In theirPoint, Fleming and Oswick propose ‘loosely coupled abduction’ as a mode of reasoning that steers a middle ground between unbounded, ‘creative’ abduction and highly proceduralized, ‘disciplined’ abduction. In theirCounterpoint, Filatotchev et al. accept the creative promise of abduction but warn that consensus‐based plausibility can engender what they call ‘semiotic abduction’, where mechanisms become widely accepted through repetition rather than verification. Building on these contributions, in this introduction to the debate, I situate abduction within the broader landscape of deductive and inductive reasoning in management research, critically evaluate the arguments advanced by thePointandCounterpoint, and propose avenues for future research on the role of abductive reasoning in management and organization studies.</content>

    <title>Investment under Upstream and Downstream Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of uncertainty shocks on firm‐level economic activity depends on their origin in supply chains. Upstream (downstream) uncertainty from suppliers (customers) is associated with variability over future input (output) prices. Consequently, a real‐option production model with time‐to‐build suggests that only upstream uncertainty suppresses investment, since upstream (downstream) uncertainty affects the shorter (longer) run. Production network data show that upstream uncertainty negatively affects firm‐level outcomes. Conversely, downstream uncertainty affects firm‐level outcomes more weakly but positively. At the macro level, these two uncertainties oppositely predict aggregate growth and asset prices. Overall, downstream uncertainty has an expansionary effect, in contrast to other facets of uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conceptualizing impatience as an emotion, and patience as the regulation of that emotion, offers new insights and opportunities for the study of consumer behavior. While this framework has primarily been applied to impatience for positive events, many real‐life events of interest involve decisions about negative or mixed‐valence events. In this commentary, I explore how impatience and patience play out in these situations, explaining a set of previously disconnected “anomalies” in the literature on intertemporal choice, yielding fresh insights and applications in consumer psychology. Finally, I explore when and how people may want to cultivate (rather than regulate) impatience for gains and losses.</content>

    <title>Can Regulation Restore Authenticity? Evidence from Policies Against Online Review Suppression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Businesses have long sought to shape their online reputations, not only by soliciting positive reviews but also by suppressing negative ones through legal threats. Such practices distort consumer decision-making and undermine trust in digital marketplaces. To address this problem, the U.S. Congress enacted the Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA) in 2016, prohibiting businesses from using contractual clauses or intimidation to silence consumer feedback. Leveraging millions of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, this study provides the first systematic evaluation of the CRFA’s effectiveness. We find that after the law’s enactment, U.S. hotel reviews became longer, more candid, and systematically more negative. Effects were especially strong for less reputable hotels, highly competitive markets, and experienced reviewers, pointing to where suppression had been most prevalent. Supplemental analyses confirm similar patterns using Google Places data and state-level repeals of criminal defamation laws. These findings demonstrate that regulation can effectively restore transparency and authenticity in online review platforms. For policymakers, the results provide concrete evidence that consumer-protection laws can counteract harmful business practices. For managers and platforms, they underscore the value of fostering open feedback ecosystems that promote trust and informed consumer choice.</content>

    <title>Determinants of Employee Victory in Telecommuting Labor Disputes: A Configurational Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid expansion of telecommuting during the COVID‐19 pandemic created novel disputes over remote‐work conditions that existing laws did not clearly regulate. This study investigates the configurational determinants of employee victory in these disputes. Drawing on resource‐based and institutional theories of litigation outcomes, we propose an analytical framework comprising three categories of determinants: employee resources (income, tenure, and legal representation), employer resources (enterprise size and maturity), and institutional factors (dispute type and government policy invocation). Using fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 287 first‐instance telecommuting labor‐dispute judgments from China in 2020, we identify five equifinal pathways to employee success. These pathways reveal that no single factor guarantees victory; instead, success depends on specific synergies, such as high‐income employees leveraging policy support in individual disputes or long‐tenured employees utilizing collective action against strong enterprises. These findings offer a configurational perspective on how resources and institutional factors jointly shape remote‐work litigation outcomes.</content>

    <title>The Cost of Surveillance: How Perceived Invasiveness of Electronic Performance Monitoring Triggers Workplace Cheating</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rapid expansion of emerging digital technologies, human resource practitioners are increasingly adopting advanced electronic performance monitoring (EPM) approaches to ensure employee compliance and productivity. However, they have largely overlooked that the invasive EPM may lead to unintended, reversed outcomes, such as cheating. Integrating the self‐protection model of workplace cheating and fairness heuristic theory, our research aims to delineate how and when perceived EPM invasiveness triggers employee cheating. Through a field survey and an experimental study, we obtained converging evidence supporting our model. Specifically, we find that perceived EPM invasiveness leads to cheating via anger (a self‐protection emotion) and moral disengagement (a self‐protection cognition). In addition, overall justice mitigates the harmful psychological and behavioral consequences of perceived EPM invasiveness. This research contributes to the EPM literature and provides practical guidance to organizations on the effective use of performance management tools in the digital era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bridges are critical but sparse links in land transport networks. I exploit quasi-experimental variation in bridge construction over major rivers in the United States to measure the causal effects of land transport infrastructure. Bridges are more often built upstream than downstream of tributary confluences—where smaller rivers join larger rivers—generating local differences in connectivity. These local connectivity advantages have negative effects on per capita income. In contrast, major changes in connectivity arising from the opening of major bridges increase per capita economic activity. A narrative explanation that can reconcile both results is that land transport infrastructure creates productivity advantages that drive economic growth, structural transformation, and urbanization over large spatial scales. Local sorting within the cities that form around early transport routes then reverses this gradient over smaller spatial scales.</content>

    <title>Revolutionary Sparks: Exploring the Resource Spillover Effect of Street Protests on Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research in advanced economies shows that street protests can indirectly influence untargeted firms through informational spillovers. We propose that, in developing economies, the indirect effects of street protests extend beyond information cues to include a resource spillover effect. Specifically, local officials may be motivated to defuse or redirect the momentum of street protests by appealing to constituents’ aspirations for economic well-being. This middle-ground approach sits between symbolic gestures and targeted policies directly addressing activists’ grievances and can facilitate the creation of new organizations. Using a longitudinal data set organized by city-year observations in China between 2008 and 2019, we examine how street protests over noneconomic issues impact the founding of new ventures. We find that city mayors’ response to street protests indirectly facilitates entrepreneurship by lowering business operating costs and increasing access to capital. Further, the resource spillover effect on businesses is accentuated by a political opportunity structure that enhances the impact of street protests on the responses of local politicians.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18885 .</content>

    <title>Devaluations, Deposit Dollarization, and Household Heterogeneity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the aggregate and redistributive effects of currency devaluations in a small open economy model with leverage-constrained banks and heterogeneous households. Our framework captures three stylized facts about financial dollarization in emerging economies: (1) a sizable share of domestic deposits is denominated in foreign currency; (2) these deposits represent significant foreign currency liabilities for local banks; and (3) dollar deposits are mainly held by wealthier households. A devaluation increases the real burden of foreign currency debt, causing an erosion of banks’ net worth, which depresses credit supply and economic activity. While richer households are partially insulated through their dollar deposits, poorer households cut consumption sharply in response to rising borrowing costs and falling real labor income. In our model deposit, dollarization amplifies the contractionary effects of a devaluation on output, investment, and consumption, in line with new empirical evidence for emerging economies. To achieve this result, both constrained intermediaries and heterogeneous households are crucial. In our framework, regulating dollarization can result in widespread welfare gains, especially for poorer households.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The information banks produce drives their lending decisions and macroeconomic outcomes, but this information is inherently difficult to analyse because it is private. We construct a novel measure of bank information quality from confidential regulatory data that include banks’ private risk assessments for US corporate loans. Information quality improves as local economic conditions deteriorate, particularly for new loans, large loans, and loans with higher expected losses. Information quality also declines during periods of rapid local house price appreciation. Our results provide empirical support for theories of countercyclical information production in credit markets.</content>

Higher expected inflation decreases firms’ real liabilities and default risk, which helps reduce debt overhang. However, it hurts intermediaries’ real assets, leading to a contraction in credit supply. We theoretically demonstrate that intermediary financing conditions play a key role in the transmission of nominal shocks, influencing the premium investors require for bearing inflation risk. We provide empirical evidence supporting our novel inflation transmission mechanism and connect our findings to the banking stress of 2023. We also show that Taylor rules responding to both financial and real variables can help stabilise our economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A screening instrument is costly if it is socially wasteful and productive otherwise. A principal screens an agent with multidimensional private information and quasilinear preferences that are additively separable across two components: a onedimensional productive component and a multidimensional costly component. Can the principal improve upon simple one-dimensional mechanisms by also using the costly instruments? We show that if the agent has preferences between the two components that are positively correlated in a suitably defined sense, then simply screening the productive component is optimal. The result holds for general type and allocation spaces, and allows for nonlinear and interdependent valuations. We discuss applications to monopoly pricing, bundling, and labor market screening.</content>

    <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Managing Supply Chain Data Security: The Differentially Private Newsvendor</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An Algorithmic Approach to Managing Supply Chain Data Security: The Differentially Private NewsvendorIn “An Algorithmic Approach to Managing Supply Chain Data Security: The Differentially Private Newsvendor,” Chen and Chua examine an emerging challenge in data-driven operations: inventory decisions can unintentionally reveal sensitive demand information. Even when raw demand data are never shared, observers may reverse-engineer the data from small changes in order quantities. This risk is particularly acute in supply chains, where decisions are frequent, data-intensive, and easily observable. To mitigate this threat, the paper develops a suite of differentially private algorithms for the contextual newsvendor problem. These methods introduce carefully calibrated randomness into the newsvendor model, ensuring strong privacy protection under differential privacy while maintaining near-optimal operational performance. The authors also identify key drivers of the cost of privacy—data set size, contextual richness, and product variety—offering actionable guidance for firms seeking secure yet efficient data-driven operations. Finally, they demonstrate that privacy-preserving decisions can distort demand signals and reduce upstream supplier profits, highlighting important supply-chain-wide implications of data protection.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In “Post Reinforcement Learning Inference,” Vasilis Syrgkanis and Ruohan Zhan develop a new inferential framework for data collected via reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the adaptive systems that update strategies as outcomes unfold. Traditional statistical methods fail in this setting because adaptivity induces time-varying variance and dependence across samples. Syrgkanis and Zhan propose an adaptively weighted generalized method of moments (AW-GMM) estimator that stabilizes this variance through data-dependent weights. They prove that the weighted estimator achieves consistency and asymptotic normality, enabling valid hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for policy values and dynamic treatment effects. Their method provides a unified approach for structural estimation and inference under nonstationary, adaptively generated sequence data, with applications to dynamic off-policy evaluation and personalized decision systems.</content>

    <title>The Zombie Lending Channel of Monetary Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a new channel in the monetary policy transmission to nonfinancial corporates—the zombie lending channel. Our findings show that unviable and unproductive zombie firms are less affected by contractionary monetary policy relative to other firms because of a more muted tightening in credit conditions. We rationalize this result with a strengthening in evergreening motives when interest rates rise: lenders face incentives to extend loans to zombies to prevent them from defaulting. Strengthening banks’ balance sheets and curbing risky lending behavior could help mitigate zombie lending practices when financial conditions tighten.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07315 .</content>

    <title>What Do Trade Allowances Look Like? Evidence from Actual Payments to a Big-Box Retailer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document key features of trade allowances—a major component of the contracts between large retailers and manufacturers—using a unique panel data set on allowance payments negotiated between two supermarket chains owned by a large retailer and its suppliers over a two-year period. We show that trade allowances are large in magnitude, are paid by the vast majority of suppliers, and vary substantially over categories and, especially, across suppliers within categories. We further study trade allowance behavior along key dimensions of the manufacturer–retailer relationship. First, we report important interdependencies between allowances paid by multicategory suppliers across different categories, suggesting that single-category analysis of manufacturer–retailer interactions may be misleading. Second, we show that dedicated private label manufacturers do pay allowances, and that dual branders (i.e., national brand manufacturers who in addition produce private labels) tend to pay lower allowances than fully national brand manufacturers. Third, we examine the relationship between allowance payments and price promotional activities and find that price and nonprice incentives tend to be treated as substitutes. Fourth, we document a positive relationship between allowance payments and prices, suggesting that trade allowances do not mitigate the double marginalization problem. Finally, the evidence suggests that both market power and efficiency aspects are at play in the explanation of trade allowances.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy [Grant ICM IS130002] and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico [Initiation Grant 11180301 and Regular Grant 1170029].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00817 .</content>

    <title>Platform Expansion Through Asset Provision: Ownership, Commitment, and Flexibility</title>
    <updated>2025-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service platforms connect consumers to independent providers, who typically deliver the service using their own assets (e.g., ride-hailing with suitable vehicles). To expand their services, platforms have introduced programs aimed at attracting prospective providers who lack the requisite assets. These programs diverge in terms of asset ownership and contract structures. In platform financing, the platform offers to finance providers’ asset investments, serving as an alternative to bank loans. Under employment and rental schemes, by contrast, the platform itself invests in assets and offers them to providers through long-term employment-like contracts or short-term rentals. We develop a game-theoretical model to study the viability and relative performance of these mechanisms. With bank financing as benchmark, we find that although each mechanism can be profitable, they also face distinct challenges. For example, platform financing often fails to benefit the platform in its simple interest-only form and instead requires payments tied to providers’ on-platform performance. Comparing these mechanisms highlights a tradeoff between the platform committing to a mutually beneficial contract with the providers and leveraging their flexibility as independent service providers. Consequently, the platform prefers the strongest commitment option—employment—when demand is high and investment cost is low and turns to the flexible financing or rental options as demand weakens or investment cost increases. Additionally, we find that minimum-wage regulation could benefit not only service providers but also the platform, particularly under financing or rental. Finally, when the providers’ outside options rely less on access to assets, employment gains ground as the preferred expansion strategy.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: S.

    <title>More Light but Less Sight? The Dual Effect of Information Transparency on Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whether more information available in capital markets fosters or hinders corporate innovation—and ultimately long-term firm value—remains a contentious question. Does enhanced transparency discipline managerial decision-making, or does it induce short-termism? This study addresses this tension by proposing that firms’ R&amp;D capabilities critically moderate these opposing effects. Leveraging the European Union’s mandate for quarterly reporting as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ a difference-in-differences design to a panel of EU-listed manufacturing firms. We uncover a dual pathway: For firms with weaker R&amp;D capabilities, greater transparency exerts a disciplining effect, leading to reduced R&amp;D investment and enhancing firms’ value. Conversely, firms with stronger capabilities reallocate R&amp;D toward more familiar domains to deliver quicker returns, consistent with a myopic response that limits exploration and undermines long-term value. Our findings contribute to management theory by unpacking how capital market pressures differentially affect the “whether” and “where” of innovation decisions and offer policymakers important insights into the unintended consequences of disclosure regulation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the increasing recognition of digital globalization in international business (IB) literature, there is a more pressing need for a comprehensive understanding of the unprecedented power generated by big-tech multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper suggests that harnessing data ubiquity globally, instantaneously, and continuously represents a defining feature and a revolutionary power source for big-tech MNEs. By leveraging global data value chains through  a mutually reinforcing data-AI feedback loop of data access, analysis, and application, big-tech MNEs can reshape IB practices and challenge global regulatory frameworks. Drawing on power-dependence theory, our research framework highlights a logic of power mutuality characterized by the interplay between power generation and power counterbalance. These two forces provide a holistic lens for examining how big-tech MNEs create data-based power, but are simultaneously countered by the economic and sociopolitical stakeholders of big-tech MNEs. We propose promising avenues for future research on MNEs’ data strategies, global data value chains, foreignness and liabilities of data, and global data governance.</content>

    <title>A Robust Optimization Approach to Reliable Statistical Inference with Variables Generated by Machine Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations increasingly use machine learning to turn text, images, and other unstructured data into variables that inform decisions and research. But, because machine learning predictions are never perfect, the resulting data can contain errors that quietly distort statistical analyses, sometimes leading to incorrect conclusions about what truly drives important outcomes. This study introduces a robust optimization approach that helps analysts and decision makers draw more reliable insights when working with machine learning–generated data. The method is designed to strengthen the signal of real effects, reducing the influence of noisy or imperfect predictions, resulting in more trustworthy hypothesis tests and fewer missed or misleading findings. The approach also includes a simple correction step that uses a small amount of high-quality labeled data—such as a subset of manually reviewed cases—to further improve accuracy. Across simulations and a real-world example using Amazon reviews, the method consistently delivers more dependable results than common alternatives. For professionals who rely on machine learning in areas such as marketing, operations, public policy, or risk management, this framework offers a practical, transparent way to ensure that conclusions remain sound even when data sources are imperfect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in human resource management (HRM), especially in performance appraisals, questions arise about how employees respond to AI involvement in these processes. While existing research often treats AI as a technical tool, this study also views AI as a social actor that interacts with employees. Using sociomateriality and attribution theory, we examine how AI's characteristics and its role in appraisal procedures influence employee satisfaction with performance appraisals. Across three scenario‐based experiments with 1002 participants and one survey with 321 respondents, we find that certain characteristics of the AI rater and the decision‐making power distribution in AI appraisal procedures have a significant impact on employees' performance appraisal satisfaction. These results highlight the importance of considering the technical and social dimensions of AI in HRM practices. Our findings offer practical guidance for organizations implementing AI in performance appraisals and contribute to a deeper understanding of AI's impact on the employee experience.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To improve sales and operational processes that support business outcomes, such as converting sales opportunities and the revenue from these conversions, firms invest in sales content platforms—shared digital warehouses for storing, managing, and distributing information required for sales activities. However, the effectiveness of such digital sales operations investments remains unclear. To investigate, this study explores the effects of salespeople accessing sales content platforms across two studies. First, a qualitative study reveals that access to sales content platforms helps salespeople learn valuable information and adapt their behaviors throughout the sales process. Salespeople with extensive tenure benefit disproportionately from sales content platform access, especially when it is unclear which information to rely on and how best to act on it. These insights inform the quantitative analysis in our second study, which utilizes a unique dataset from a global business-to-business firm specializing in advanced technologies. The results confirm that access to sales content platforms helps salespeople convert sales opportunities, but this effect depends on the type of content accessed, the sales process phase, and salesperson tenure. Furthermore, the benefits of sales content platform access do not always lead to increased revenue from converted opportunities. These findings offer actionable guidance for managers seeking to maximize returns on their investments in sales content platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that exposure to anti‐capitalist ideology can exert a lasting influence on attitudes toward capital markets and stock market participation. Using novel survey, bank, and broker data, we document that, decades after Germany's reunification, East Germans invest significantly less in stocks and hold more negative views on capital markets. Effects vary by personal experience under communism. Results are strongest for individuals who remember life in the German Democratic Republic positively, for example, those living in a “showcase city.” Results reverse for those with negative experiences like environmental pollution or lack of Western TV entertainment.</content>

    <title>When do firms learn by hiring? How complexity moderates the value of new knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations often hire employees hoping to acquire new knowledge. While the literature has paid considerable attention to the role of the characteristics of the source of knowledge, the recipient firm, and the knowledge being transferred, it has largely overlooked those of the knowledge being replaced. Using a computational model, we examine how the pre‐existing knowledge of the hiring firm—specifically its degrees of internal and external fit—influences its ability to learn. Our findings suggest that firms with lower internal fit absorb new knowledge more quickly, even when controlling for initial external fit. We identify several mechanisms driving this dynamic, demonstrating how persistent resistance to new knowledge and sudden shifts can emerge solely through mutual learning dynamics between individuals and organizations, independent of social or cognitive constraints.Managerial SummaryCompanies frequently hire employees from competitors to gain new knowledge and improve performance. We show that success in learning by hiring depends not only on who firms hire but also on the characteristics of their existing knowledge. Our findings reveal two counterintuitive dynamics. First, firms whose practices exhibit a high degree of fit face greater difficulty in absorbing new knowledge. Such extant knowledge is stickier, as incumbent employees find it harder to abandon their old approaches and keep pulling the organization back to the status quo. Second, in complex environments, struggling firms that hire aggressively may learn less effectively, as multiple hires provide conflicting advice. Thus, while such firms stand to learn more from hiring, the internal dynamics of learning within the organization frustrate the firm's effort to absorb the knowledge. We subsequently present and analyze the mechanisms responsible for these outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do resolution frameworks affect the private restructuring of distressed banks? We model a bank’s shareholders and creditors negotiating a restructuring, under two frictions: asymmetric information about asset quality and externalities on the government. High-quality banks signal themselves by delaying the negotiation, which is socially inefficient. Public policies can improve welfare if they reduce the signaling motive or increase the negotiation surplus. Stricter bail-in rules make debt more information sensitive and increase delays. The bank chooses a capital structure with too little renegotiable debt, giving a new rationale, for example, for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity requirements. (JEL G21, G28)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the design of debt repayment schedules affect household borrowing? To answer this question, we exploit a Swedish policy reform that eliminated interest-only mortgages for loan-to-value ratios above 50%. We document substantial bunching at the threshold, leading to 5% lower borrowing. Wealthy borrowers drive the results, challenging credit constraints as the primary explanation. We develop a model to evaluate the mechanisms driving household behavior and find that much of the effect comes from households experiencing ongoing flow disutility to amortization payments. Our results indicate that mortgage contracts with low initial payments substantially increase household borrowing and lifetime interest costs. (JEL G51, G21, E21, E6)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We address the issues of unequal restroom access for women and LGBTQ+ individuals, known as the potty parity problem. We propose a utility model in which users consider gender identity, wait time, and safety concerns when choosing restrooms. We evaluate different layouts’ efficiency measured by the total utilities (as in the utilitarian principle) and assess their fairness using the measures of the minimum utility gain (as in the Rawlsian fairness) and the gap between maximum and minimum gains (as in the distributive fairness). When the population is sensitive to gender identity and safety concerns, although it may initially seem intuitive to assume that converting all restrooms to unisex facilities would be efficient and fair due to the pooling of servers and increased flexibility and perceived fairness due to all users standing in the same line, our findings demonstrate that this design can be neither efficient nor fair. In contrast, we show that converting some men’s restrooms to unisex can enhance both efficiency and fairness of access. This highlights that a moderate level of flexibility can outperform a fully flexible system. Moreover, conventional wisdom suggests that removing a restroom unit from the men’s room would negatively impact users from the men’s side. However, our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that such a change can lead to a Pareto improvement, benefiting all users involved. We also analytically explore additional benefits of unisex restrooms under different user behaviors and situations and present practically relevant numerical results to support our findings.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2021-04295].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04075 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent workplace trends reveal that workers frequently discuss and engage in deliberate underperformance, underscoring the growing relevance of intentional underperformance at work. Although various disciplines have long studied purposeful reductions in work effort, these investigations have remained largely siloed, hindering conceptual clarity. In this scoping review, we integrate perspectives from management, social and educational psychology, and economics to establish a unified conceptualization of intentional underperformance (i.e., the deliberate suppression of task contributions, such that contributions fall below a relevant benchmark). In doing so, we make five primary contributions to the performance literature. First, we review and consolidate 36 related constructs to develop an umbrella conceptualization that can promote cumulative scientific understanding. Second, based on our review, we present an organized view of the antecedents and proximal motives of intentional underperformance. Third, we introduce the Intentional Underperformance Framework, a two-by-two that organizes forms of intentional underperformance, and organize the associated outcomes of these different forms. Fourth, we identify cross-disciplinary patterns in operationalizations, summarizing prevailing methods and their implications. Fifth, we outline a research agenda to guide future inquiry into when, why, and how intentional underperformance arises, as well as how organizations can constructively intervene. By integrating disconnected literatures and promoting a shared language, this review provides a foundation for more integrative theoretical and empirical inquiries. Ultimately, we aim to equip scholars and practitioners with a clearer, more comprehensive understanding of intentional underperformance in today’s workplace.</content>

    <title>Beyond Blame: Evaluative Stigma, Attribution, and Employee Careers after Employer Failure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employment continuity facilitates access to career opportunities, professional growth, and financial security, making involuntary disruptions—such as employer failures—potentially consequential for individuals’ career trajectories. Although prior research has explored how organizational leaders’ careers fare following employer failure, the implications for non-executive employees remain unclear in theoretical terms. Integrating theories of evaluation, evaluative stigma, and careers, we develop a theoretical framework to clarify how employer failure relates to subsequent career outcomes for employees. Using confidential, anonymized data from the United States Census complemented by detailed, identifiable data from the Automatic Speech Recognition industry, we find that employer failure is negatively related to organizational leaders’ wage growth, consistent with internal attribution and evaluative stigma. Conversely, non-executive employees experience wage (and industry retention) outcomes comparable to those of their unaffected peers, suggesting that affiliation with a failed employer does not stigmatize this set of employees. However, non-executive employees are not always unscathed: Career penalties emerge when failure involves a scandal, when industry labor-market conditions become more competitive, and when employees belong to some marginalized demographic groups (gender, race, immigration). By clarifying the conditions of evaluative stigma, we extend organizational research on careers and evaluations, highlighting the conditions under which affiliations with failed firms relate to subsequent career outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rapid credit expansions predict lower output growth and banking crises, but does it matter who finances them? We identify the ultimate counterparties financing credit expansions in a panel of 33 advanced economies and find that foreign-financed household credit expansions predict lower GDP growth and higher crisis risk, but domestically financed credit expansions do not. Studying the mechanisms, we find that foreign-financed household credit expansions are accompanied by higher supply of foreign capital (reflected in low credit spreads), are followed by elevated credit cycle reversal risk, and lead to higher debt service payments to foreigners which depress aggregate demand.

    <title>Linguistic Capital, Social Capital, and Self-Employment of Rural-Urban Migrants in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The entrepreneurship literature has focused on the communicative function of language, but has rarely examined linguistic capital’s effects on entrepreneurship, particularly that of dialect similarity. This research explores the role of dialect similarity in the self-employment of rural-urban migrants and how social capital, including networks and trust, mediates the role of dialect similarity in a developing economy setting. Integrating the linguistic capital theory of French sociologist Bourdieu with the social capital theory, the study examines the decision of rural-urban migrants’ self-employment in China. Analyzing the dataset from the China Migrants Dynamic Survey, we argue that rural-urban migrants who speak a dialect similar to the place of residence have a higher likelihood of engaging in self-employment, and that social capital plays a positive mediating role in self-employment decisions. We employ the Instrumental Variable and Propensity Score Matching method with a quasi-experimental approach for our empirical test. Results from both approaches strongly support our hypotheses. Lastly, research contributions and implications are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial CEOs, characterized by greater concern for their employees, enhance employee motivation but incur higher costs when implementing layoffs. We develop a psychological model of CEO‐firm matching wherein negative industry shocks requiring downsizing asymmetrically erode the match quality for prosocial CEOs. Leveraging increases in Chinese import competition, we show that layoff pressures lead to higher rates of both forced and voluntary turnover among prosocial CEOs. They are succeeded by less prosocial CEOs who are externally recruited, use less employee‐friendly language, lean Republican in political orientation, or are less likely to volunteer at charities. Our study highlights psychological characteristics as a key consideration in the executive labor market and draws attention to the “first‐stage” selection dynamics that shape the types of CEOs who lead firms.Managerial SummaryWhich firms CEOs choose to join and which CEOs are selected or retained by boards depend not only on their skills but also on the fit between their ‘personality’ and the firm's needs. We show that during industry downturns that require aggressive downsizing, prosocial CEOs are more likely to depart voluntarily, and boards actively replace them with low‐prosocial “wartime” CEOs. This dynamic nature of the CEO‐firm fit provides insights into why and when previously effective leadership may become ineffective and empirical grounds for the common distinction between peacetime and wartime CEOs. A key implication is that increasing Chinese import competition has shaped not only firm economic activities but also the psychological profiles of business leaders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mergers and acquisitions are often motivated by an intention to create value from intangible assets. We develop a word list of intangibles and apply it to takeover announcements. One standard deviation more in intangible-related language (“intangibles talk”) lowers announcement returns for the acquirer by 0.53 percentage points and predicts worse operating performance. Bidder managers appear to believe in the deals nonetheless, as evidenced by insider trades, payment choices, and completion probabilities and speed. Overall, takeover announcement texts reveal important information about hard-to-measure aspects of deal quality. (JEL G14, G34, G41)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theory of competitive equilibrium with indivisible goods based entirely on economic conditions on demand. The key idea is to analyze complementarity and substitutability between bundles of goods, rather than merely between goods themselves. This approach allows us to formulate sufficient and essentially necessary conditions for equilibrium existence—which unify settings with complements and settings with substitutes. Our analysis has implications for auction design.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study assesses concentration of the top 50 universities (T50 concentration) in premier business journals and its correlation with journal impact metrics. We use 2008-2022 data from the Web of Science and Clarivate Analytics, focusing on 46 business journals from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD 24) and Financial Times (FT 50) lists to document several findings. First, we find that the top 50 institutions, representing less than 0.5% of business schools globally, contribute a disproportionately large share of about 53% publications in these outlets. Second, our longitudinal analyses indicate that T50 concentration has remained relatively stable over the 15-year period. Finally, we find evidence of a positive and statistically significant association between T50 concentration and Article Influence Score, although we do not find any statistically significant relationship with other journal impact metrics. Importantly, we find a decline in the publication and citation share of articles authored exclusively by top-50 author teams, and a rise in share for mixed author teams from top-50 and non-top-50 universities. These findings provide data-driven insights to inform debates relating to merit and elitism in editorial and review processes in top journals.</content>

    <title>On the Impossibility of Statistically Improving Empirical Optimization: A Second Order Stochastic Dominance Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the underlying probability distribution in a stochastic optimization is observed only through data, various data-driven formulations have been studied to obtain approximate optimal solutions. We show that no such formulations can, in a sense, theoretically improve the statistical quality of the solution obtained from empirical optimization. We argue this by proving that the first order behavior of the optimality gap against the oracle best solution, which includes both the bias and variance, for any data-driven solution second order stochastically dominates that from empirical optimization as long as suitable smoothness holds with respect to the underlying distribution. We demonstrate this impossibility of improvement in examples ranging across regularized optimization, distributionally robust optimization, parametric optimization, and Bayesian generalizations. We also discuss the connections of our results to other perspectives in statistics and data-driven optimization and illustrate practical implications in choosing among data-driven formulations.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Risk Sharing in Government Contracting: Strategic Alliances as Safeguards in Government Supplier Relationships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interorganizational alliances have been extensively studied as strategic arrangements that enable firms to manage risks arising from their embeddedness in external relationships. However, the unique dynamics of business-to-government (B2G) relationships, where firms often face regulatory and political risks, remain underexplored. In this study, we examine how firms reliant on U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contracts use strategic alliances to mitigate these challenges. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm, we theorize that firms with higher government contract value are more likely to form alliances with other government contractors to help share risk and navigate government contracting challenges. We further identify two boundary conditions—an internal buffer (whether a firm operates as a generalist or specialist contractor) and an external buffer (the level of market-demand risk)—that moderate this relationship. Our analysis of 339 U.S. publicly traded DoD contractors from 2001 to 2019 provides robust support for our hypotheses. A post hoc mediation analysis further shows that alliances partially mediate the relationship between government contract value and market performance. Our study contributes to interorganizational relationships and business-government interface literatures by articulating the unique dynamics of B2G alliances and offering nuanced insights into how firms manage their relationships with powerful government buyers.</content>

    <title>Does a Long-Term Orientation Lead to Faster Growth? Firms’ Temporal Orientation and the Growth Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates how firms’ temporal orientation—operationalized through their investment horizon—influences the growth process. We propose that longer investment horizons reflect a forward-looking orientation that facilitates resource accumulation and capability development, ultimately supporting firm expansion. However, we also argue that excessively long horizons may lead to diminishing returns due to organizational frictions and coordination constraints. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between investment horizon and growth in fixed assets, employment, and sales. These findings underscore the complex role of temporal orientation in shaping distinct aspects of firm growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how online and offline shareholder activism influences a firm’s innovation focus—on exploration or exploitation—in family and non-family firms. We theorize, from a mixed gamble perspective, that such activisms pose distinctive threats to a firm’s economic and non-economic interests. We analyze 7,887 firm-year observations from Chinese listed firms (2012–2022) and find that non-family firms are more likely than family firms to shift toward exploitation in response to offline activism, and family firms are more inclined to focus on exploration when facing online activism. Additionally, second-generation family firms are found to be more responsive than first-generation firms to both forms of shareholder activism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I investigate whether there is a causal relationship between physical health and entrepreneurship by exploiting the exogenous introduction of the British Clean Air Act (CAA). This legislation generated across-cohort differences in exposure to airborne pollution. A fuzzy regression discontinuity design is used to investigate the causal impact of improved health following the CAA on adult entrepreneurship outcomes. The results carry important implications for scholarship as well as policymakers, with many governments in emerging economies seeking to curb airborne pollution and improve health and economic outcomes for their citizens, while also seeking to promote entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>A Robust Test for Weak Instruments for 2SLS with Multiple Endogenous Regressors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a test for instrument strength based on the bias of two-stage least squares (2SLS) that (1) generalizes the tests of Stock and Yogo (2005) and Sanderson and Windmeijer (2016) to be robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, and (2) extends the Montiel Olea and Pflueger (2013) robust test for models with a single endogenous regressor to multiple endogenous regressors. Our test can be based either on Stock and Yogo’s (2005) absolute bias criterion or on the 2SLS bias relative to Montiel Olea and Pflueger’s (2013) worst-case benchmark. We also develop extensions to test whether weak instruments cause bias in individual 2SLS coefficients. In simulations, our test controls size and is powerful, and we provide efficient code packages for its practical implementation. We demonstrate our testing procedures in the context of the estimation of state-dependent fiscal multipliers as in Ramey and Zubairy (2018).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we provide direct evidence on the behaviour of markups in the retail sector across space and time. Markups are measured using gross margins. We consider three levels of aggregation: the retail sector as a whole, the firm, and the product level. We find that: (1) markups are relatively stable over time and mildly procyclical; (2) there is a large regional dispersion in markups; (3) there is a positive cross-sectional correlation between local income and local markups; and (4) differences in markups across regions result from differences in the assortment of goods sold in different regions, not from deviations from uniform pricing. We propose a simple model consistent with these facts.</content>

    <title>When Interpretations of Merit Thresholds Vary and Reproduce Inequality: Entering the Tech Industry Without Computer Science Credentials</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Meritocracy is widely believed to be a fair system. Although extant literature focuses on managers’ implementation of meritocratic decisions, less attention has been paid to jobseekers’ responses to meritocratic opportunities. This study addresses this gap by examining how aspiring software developers without computer science (CS) degrees respond to the ostensibly meritocratic promise of entering tech through open-access coding skills. Drawing on interview, social media, and ethnographic data, I find that although all aspirants agreed coding skills were the key meritocratic criteria for entering tech without CS degrees, they interpreted the merit threshold (the level of coding competency needed to get their first job) differently and adopted three distinct entry strategies that varied in timing and scope—Early/Broad, Standard, and Late/Narrow. Follow-up data collected three years later revealed that one strategy (Early/Broad) was associated with high employment rates across all subgroups of aspirants and substantially increased employment chances for those historically underrepresented in tech. Yet, most did not opt for it. Indeed, only one group (White men with white-collar/professional backgrounds) clustered in strategies with higher employment rates, resulting in this population securing jobs at a higher rate than others. To explain the variation in merit thresholds and accompanying entry strategies, this study highlights aspirants’ previous encounters with demand-side actors—particularly, their perceptions of whether, and to what extent, employers had previously been willing to give them a chance. These findings contribute to research on meritocracy and labor markets and offer insights into building a more diverse workforce.Funding: This work was supported by the American Sociological Association Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement [Grant 55209764] and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth [Grant 5510223].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17752 .</content>

    <title>Matching Drivers to Riders: A Two-Stage Robust Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Matchmaking for Ride-Hailing PlatformsRide-hailing platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and DiDi must assign drivers to riders every minute without knowing who will request a ride next. Most systems optimize each batch myopically, and this can leave some future riders waiting much longer than necessary. In “Matching Drivers to Riders: A Two-Stage Robust Approach,” accepted for publication in Operations Research, the authors propose a two-stage robust matching model that incorporates uncertainty about future demand. The first stage matches current riders, reserving enough nearby drivers for plausible future scenarios; the second stage then tests these decisions against the most adverse demand patterns to guarantee good performance even in the worst case. The authors prove that finding the best such policy is computationally hard, but they develop constant factor approximation algorithms for several practically relevant cases and test them on large-scale taxi data from Shenzhen, China. Their methods substantially reduce maximum rider waiting times with little or no sacrifice in average travel distances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research and lay intuition suggest that amplifying image concerns promotes generosity. We test the impact of image-based interventions in consumer elective pricing (CEP), where individuals choose how much to pay for products or services. Across 10 studies (nine field experiments and one laboratory study, n = 3,182), we examine the effects of these interventions on payments and elicit forecasts from independent participants (n = 1,636). Forecasters predict large positive effects, yet behavioral data reveal small and inconsistent impacts. What drives the inconsistency between predictions and actual outcomes? Studies with more than 4,000 forecasters show that neither simulating the decision-making experience nor prior experience with CEP improve prediction accuracy. However, avoiding direct comparisons between experimental conditions—which can artificially amplify perceived differences—reduces overestimation. These findings highlight challenges associated with transferring behavioral insights across contexts and show how forecast elicitation methods shape expectations of intervention effectiveness.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00149 .</content>

    <title>Missing Team Dynamics? An Integrative Review of Research on Team Development Over Time</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory describing the development, functioning, and performance of work teams emphasizes their dynamic nature. For many years, empirical research on teams has failed to keep pace with theory, impeding understanding of how teamwork unfolds over time and teams as a whole. However, over the past several decades, research examining the onset and functioning of change in teams has significantly increased. Our review distinguishes two primary theoretical perspectives that have dominated the field’s understanding of team development and provides a foundation for integrating both perspectives, which would allow for a more nuanced understanding. With the overarching goal of summarizing findings from this burgeoning literature, we conduct a systematic review of 110 articles (116 studies) that examine team development and teams over time. We synthesize evidence to illustrate how team phenomena (i.e., composition, leadership, emergent states, processes, and outcomes) change over time and interact dynamically with one another. We conclude by offering several high-level critiques of the literature, along with proposed solutions to address these issues. In doing so, we move beyond a general call for more research on team dynamics toward a more precise account of the decisions and considerations that should guide future work. Taken together, our manuscript provides scholars with a detailed account of how teams develop over time, challenging the long-held assumption that there is a dearth of work in this domain, and a foundation to position future work within a more integrated understanding of team development.</content>

    <title>The Glass Is Half Full: A Gendered Model of Illegal Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals in impoverished communities often face considerable adversity. Under such circumstances, they can turn to illegal entrepreneurship. However, from a gendered perspective, women are typically considered incongruent with the masculinity of crime and entrepreneurship and, thus, illegal entrepreneurship. In this study, we were interested in exploring how women navigate their society’s gender role expectations to engage in illegal entrepreneurship. We adopted a qualitative, inductive approach to explore the cognitive processes through which women entrepreneurs navigate these tensions to manufacture and sell illegal alcohol within their impoverished communities throughout India. Our resulting gendered model of the cognitive processes underlying illegal entrepreneurship in impoverished communities offers new insights into how women entrepreneurs use cognitive carve-outs to navigate potentially conflicting societal expectations regarding gender and entrepreneurial roles. Further, we explore how entrepreneurship is influenced by construals, particularly in contexts of resource scarcity and gendered constraints. Finally, in line with the dark side of entrepreneurship, we shed light on how women can justify to themselves and others entrepreneurial action that, while shielding themselves from immediate personal repercussions, imposes substantial costs on many members of their impoverished communities.</content>

    <title>The Orchestrator’s Dilemma: How Ericsson Strategically Recombined Resource Commitments and Signaling Tactics to Outmaneuver WiMAX</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Orchestrators shape ecosystem development by aligning diverse participants while advancing their own competitive agendas. This alignment becomes fragile when a new entrant offers an alternative value proposition that appeals to ecosystem participants but threatens an orchestrator’s position. Whereas prior research highlights the success of new entrants, less is known about how an orchestrator defends its competitive interests and position while addressing expectations of cooperation from ecosystem participants, which we call the “orchestrator’s dilemma.” We investigate these dynamics through a longitudinal study of Ericsson’s responses as Intel attempted to promote WiMAX as an alternative to LTE, Ericsson’s fourth-generation mobile technology. Our analysis shows how Ericsson recombined its substantive resource commitments and signaling tactics to develop three distinct strategic responses—avoiding competition, covert competition, and overt competition—as ecosystem support for the new entrant’s value proposition changed over time. We show how an orchestrator can defend its position against disruptive entrants by decoupling signaling tactics from substantive resource commitments to influence ecosystem dynamics. We contribute by theorizing these dynamic strategic responses as a way to overcome the orchestrator’s dilemma and by highlighting the social aspects of ecosystem alignment and its fragility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the rate of firm growth influences corporate social responsibility (CSR). Periods of rapid growth can place substantial financial and managerial demands on firms, requiring leaders to prioritize the allocation of limited resources toward managing expansion. We propose that when firms grow quickly, managers may limit CSR investments—not because they undervalue CSR, but because growth itself consumes financial and attentional capacity. Using 19 years of data from 4,305 firms across 46 countries, we find that faster firm growth is associated with lower levels of CSR activity. This relationship is moderated by firms’ financial and attentional resources: firms with greater financial slack and managerial bandwidth maintain stronger CSR engagement even while growing rapidly. Overall, our results suggest that the relationship between growth and CSR reflects a pragmatic balancing of competing demands.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the impact of new venture team (NVT) stability on long‐run organizational growth. With an instrumental variable design, we leverage a matched employer‐employee dataset of all Danish new ventures from 1981 to 1997. We find strong evidence that NVT stability has a positive effect on organizational growth in employees and that the effect grows stronger over time. We also find that stability is especially impactful for larger teams and for teams with higher education levels. The gains from stability also appear to be driven entirely by mixed‐gender teams. We connect our findings to the literature on NVT dynamics and suggest avenues for future research.Managerial SummaryStability within founding teams is crucial for the longevity and expansion of new ventures. We examine a dataset of Danish startups and find that ventures with stable founding teams demonstrate a 16.1 percentage point higher likelihood of survival and a 20.4% increase in average size after 10 years. This effect is accentuated in larger, more educated, and gender‐diverse teams. For entrepreneurs, these insights underscore the importance of not only assembling a strong initial team but also maintaining its composition to leverage growth opportunities as the business evolves.</content>

    <title>Interacting with Man or Machine: When Do Humans Reason Better?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The resolution of complex problems is widely seen as the next challenge for hybrid human–artificial intelligence (AI) teams. This paper uses experiments to assess whether there is a difference in the quality of human reasoning depending on whether the humans interact with humans or algorithms. For this purpose, we design an interactive reasoning task and compare the performance of humans when paired with other humans and AI. Varying the difficulty of the task (i.e., steps of counterfactual reasoning required), we find that, for simple tasks, subjects perform much better if they play with other humans, whereas the opposite is true for difficult problems. Additional experiments in which subjects play with human experts show that the differences are driven by the knowledge that AI reasons correctly rather than that it is nonhuman.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03315 .</content>

    <title>Humans’ Use of AI Assistance: The Effect of Loss Aversion on Willingness to Delegate Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become pervasive in business applications, so too have interactions between AI and humans in business processes and decision-making. A growing area of research has focused on human decision and task delegation to AI assistants. Simultaneously, extensive research on algorithm aversion—humans’ resistance to algorithm-based decision tools—has demonstrated potential barriers and issues with AI applications in business. In this paper, we test a simple strategy for mitigating algorithm aversion in the context of AI task delegation. We show that simply changing the framing of decision tasks can allay algorithm aversion. Through multiple studies, we found that participants exhibited a strong preference for human assistance over AI assistance when they were rewarded for task performance (i.e., money was gained for good performance), even when the AI had been shown to outperform the human assistant on the task. Alternatively, when we reframed the task such that the participant experienced losses for poor performance (i.e., money was taken from their endowment for poor performance), the bias for preferring human assistance was removed. Under loss framing, participants delegated the decision task to human and AI assistants at similar rates. We demonstrate this finding across tasks at differing levels of complexity and at different incentive sizes. We also provide evidence that loss framing increases situational awareness, which drives the observed effects. Our results offer useful insights on reducing algorithm aversion that extend the literature and provide actionable suggestions for practitioners and managers.This paper was accepted by Dongjun Wu, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05585 .</content>

    <title>Behavioral Externalities of Process Automation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the behavioral effects of process automation on human workers interacting with automated tasks. We introduce a stylized normative model with two workers who complete their tasks sequentially, working toward a joint project to obtain a fixed payment plus a variable bonus that depends on how early the project is completed. The normative model prescribes that, if workers are fully rational, they will complete their tasks as soon as possible if the early completion bonus is high enough. However, following the literature, we hypothesize that workers will suboptimally delay project completion. Following the insights from a behavioral model, we further predict that automation will alleviate this problem by reducing strategic uncertainty, resulting in an indirect behavioral benefit of a higher worker productivity, in addition to the direct benefit of a higher project completion rate and a shorter project duration. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment replicating the theoretical model, varying (i) whether a worker collaborates with a coworker or a robot, and (ii) in the case of collaborating with a robot, whether the upstream or downstream task is the one automated. First, we find that workers largely deviate from the optimal policy, as they take longer than what the normative theory prescribes to complete their tasks or do not complete the project. Second, we show that process automation increases the project completion rate and reduces the project completion time, confirming the benefits of process automation. Interestingly, workers who collaborate with robots take longer to complete their tasks, contradicting our initial hypothesis that process automation has a positive effect on the productivity of human workers. In addition, we find that upstream automation is more beneficial than downstream automation. We also show that social preferences are an important driver of these results because prosocial subjects tend to be more productive when collaborating with a human coworker than with a robot. Finally, we show that our findings remain robust in a continuous processing setting.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, the City University of New York, and the University of Texas at Dallas.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing agreement among researchers and developers that in certain machine-learning (ML) tasks, it may be advantageous to keep a “human in the loop” rather than rely on fully autonomous systems. Continual human involvement can mitigate machine bias and performance deterioration while enabling humans to continue learning from insights derived by ML. Yet a microlevel theory that effectively facilitates joint and continual learning in both humans and machines is still lacking. To address this need, we adopt a design science approach and build on theories of human reciprocal learning to develop an abstract configuration for reciprocal human-ML (RHML) in the context of text message classification. This configuration supports learning cycles between humans and machines who repeatedly exchange feedback regarding a classification task and adjust their knowledge representations accordingly. Our configuration is instantiated in Fusion, a novel technology artifact. Fusion is developed iteratively in two case studies of cybersecurity forums (drug trafficking and hacker attacks), in which domain experts and ML models jointly learn to classify textual messages. In the final stage, we conducted two experiments of the RHML configuration to gauge both human and machine learning processes over eight learning cycles. Generalizing our insights, we provide formal design principles for the development of systems to support RHML.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial decision makers are increasingly supported by advanced data analytics and other artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies, but they are often found to be hesitant to follow the algorithmic advice. We examine how compensation contract design and framing of an AI algorithm influence decision makers’ reliance on algorithmic advice and performance in a price estimation task. Based on a large sample of almost 1,500 participants, we find that compared with a fixed compensation, both compensation contracts based on individual performance and tournament contracts lead to an increase in effort duration and to more reliance on algorithmic advice. We further find that using an AI algorithm that is framed as also incorporating human expertise has positive effects on advice utilization, especially for decision makers with fixed pay contracts. By showing how widely used control practices, such as incentives and task framing, influence the interaction of human decision makers with AI algorithms, our findings have direct implications for managerial practice.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02777 .</content>

    <title>Improving Human Sequential Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workers spend a significant amount of time learning how to make good decisions. Evaluating the efficacy of a given decision, however, can be complicated—for example, decision outcomes are often long-term and relate to the original decision in complex ways. Surprisingly, even though learning good decision-making strategies is difficult, the strategies can often be expressed in simple and concise forms. Focusing on sequential decision making, we design a novel machine learning algorithm that is capable of extracting “best practices” from trace data and conveying its insights to humans in the form of interpretable “tips.” Our algorithm selects the tip that best bridges the gap between the actions taken by human workers and those taken by the optimal policy in a way that accounts for which actions are consequential for achieving higher performance. We evaluate our approach through a series of randomized controlled experiments where participants manage a virtual kitchen. Our experiments show that the tips generated by our algorithm can significantly improve human performance relative to intuitive baselines. In addition, we discuss a number of empirical insights that can help inform the design of algorithms intended for human-AI interfaces. For instance, we find evidence that participants do not simply blindly follow our tips; instead, they combine them with their own experience to discover additional strategies for improving performance.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the Mack Institute for Innovation Management, the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Open Research Commons, and The Wharton Behavioral Lab.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02455 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Failing to follow expert advice can have real and dangerous consequences. While any number of factors may lead a decision maker to refuse expert advice, the proliferation of algorithmic experts has further complicated the issue. One potential mechanism that restricts the acceptance of expert advice is betrayal aversion, or the strong dislike for the violation of trust norms. This study explores whether the introduction of expert algorithms in place of human experts can attenuate betrayal aversion and lead to higher overall rates of seeking expert advice. In other words, we ask: are decision makers averse to algorithmic betrayal? The answer to this question is uncertain ex ante. We answer this question through an experimental financial market where there is an identical risk of betrayal from either a human or algorithmic financial advisor. We find that the willingness to delegate to human experts is significantly reduced by betrayal aversion, while no betrayal aversion is exhibited toward algorithmic experts. The impact of betrayal aversion toward financial advisors is considerable: the resulting unwillingness to take the advice of the human expert leads to a 20% decrease in subsequent earnings, while no loss in earnings is observed in the algorithmic expert condition. This study has significant implications for firms, policymakers, and consumers, specifically in the financial services industry.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers disclose personal information when they interact with connected technologies. The advent of voice technology has enabled consumers to interact with connected technologies not only through typing but also through speaking. The present research investigates whether consumers expect different levels of privacy for information they disclose via different communication modalities. The results of three studies suggest that consumers have more restrictive privacy expectations for information disclosed via speech as compared with text. The studies probe the viability of several mechanisms that may drive this effect and test practically relevant moderators. The results suggest that the effect is driven, at least in part, by increased feelings of ownership over content disclosed via speech as compared with text. Of relevance to multiple stakeholders, the article discusses implications for privacy regulation, privacy-preserving application design, targeted advertising, and the “privacy paradox.”This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Marketing Science Institute [4001309], NYU Stern Center for Global Economy and Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03954 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When organizations adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize individuals’ negative emotions and accordingly allocate limited resources, strategic users are incentivized to game the system by misrepresenting their emotions. The value of AI in automating such emotion-driven allocation may be undermined by gaming behavior, algorithmic noise in emotion detection, and the spillover effect of negative emotions. We develop a game-theoretical model to understand emotion AI adoption, particularly in customer care, and analyze the design of the associated allocation policies. We find that adopting emotion AI is valuable if the spillover effect of negative emotions is negligible compared with resource misallocation loss, regardless of algorithmic noise and gaming behavior. We also quantify the welfare impacts of emotion AI on the users, organization, and society. Notably, a stronger AI is not always socially desirable and regulation on emotion-driven allocation is needed. Finally, we characterize conditions under which leveraging the AI system is preferred to hiring human employees in emotion-driven allocation. We also explore the alternative application of using emotion AI to monitor strategic employees and compare it with hiring a human manager for monitoring. Intriguingly, algorithmic noise may increase the profit of AI monitoring. Our work provides implications for designing, adopting, and regulating emotion AI.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test how effective a human–algorithm interaction is at stopping users from overdrawing their bank accounts. We use a randomized field experiment and draw our sample from users of a large personal financial management platform operating in the United States and Canada. We find that sending as-needed reminders is effective in and of itself, and the impact is intensified by the human response to the structure of the message. More simple messages are more effective, and the framing of the simplified message makes a difference. Users with medium to high annual incomes and users with fair to good credit scores are most likely to respond positively. We find that the investigated artificial intelligence solution reduces information-gathering costs and has a positive effect but is not sufficient in all cases. Those with challenging financial situations may find it harder to act upon the warning. For our analysis, we employ parametric identifications and time-to-event semiparametric analysis. Our work contributes to the literature on financial technology as advisors, human–computer interaction, limited attention, behavioral finance, and experimental finance.This paper was accepted by Jean-Edouard Colliard, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms increasingly interact on unstructured managerial tasks. We propose that tailoring this human-AI interaction to align with individuals’ cognitive preferences is essential for enhancing performance. This hypothesis is examined through a field experiment in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. In the experiment, we manipulated four contextual parameters of human-AI interaction—work procedures, decision-making authority, training, and incentives—to align with sales experts’ cognitive styles, categorized as either adaptors or innovators. Our results show that tailored interaction significantly improves sales performance, whereas untailored interaction results in negative treatment effects compared with both the tailored and control conditions. Qualitative evidence suggests that this negative outcome arises from role conflicts and ambiguities in untailored interaction. Exploring the mechanisms underlying these outcomes further, a mediation analysis of AI login data reveals that human-AI interaction tailoring leads sales experts to adjust their AI utilization, which contributes to the observed performance outcomes. These findings support a human-centered approach to AI that prioritizes individuals’ information-processing needs and tailors their interaction with AI accordingly.This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Erling Persson Family Foundation; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [Grants 100013M 204670, 181364, 185164]; Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [Grant W20-0036]; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [Grants 2021.0074, 2021.0133].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03849 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work is increasingly being completed by humans and algorithms in collaboration. A relative strength of humans in this partnership is their insight: private information that is relevant to the task but not available to computerized systems. I introduce a flexible model of managerial insight that accepts any distribution of demand, an advantage over alternative models, and apply it to the newsvendor setting. The optimal policy in this setting is theoretically straightforward but difficult for managers to implement directly. I propose a novel method called FIND that leverages historical forecasts to convert a point estimate of demand into a conditional probability distribution. In eight experiments, FIND outperforms all other ordering regimes considered over a broad range of conditions. To model subtle, unstructured demand signals, the last four experiments convey managerial insight nonquantitatively using images, colors, and tones. FIND performs equally well with these perceptual signals as it does with more traditional numerical signals.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (Award No. 1729837) and the Research Grant Program of the Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03919 .</content>

    <title>My Advisor, Her AI, and Me: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Human–AI Collaboration and Investment Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid ongoing policy and managerial debates on keeping humans in the loop of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making processes, we investigate whether human involvement in AI-based service production benefits downstream consumers. Partnering with a large savings bank in Europe, we produced pure AI and human–AI collaborative investment advice, which we passed to the bank customers and investigated the degree of their advice taking in a field experiment. On the production side, contrary to concerns that humans might inefficiently override AI output, our findings show that having a human banker in the loop of AI-based financial advisory by giving her the final say over the advice provided does not compromise the quality of the advice. More importantly, on the consumption side, we find that the bank customers are more likely to align their final investment decisions with advice from the human–AI collaboration, compared with pure AI, especially when facing more risky investments. In our setting, this increased reliance on human–AI collaborative advice leads to higher material welfare for consumers. Additional analyses from the field experiment along with an online controlled experiment indicate that the persuasive efficacy of human–AI collaborative advice cannot be attributed to consumers’ belief in increased advice quality resulting from complementarities between human and AI capabilities. Instead, the consumption-side benefits of human involvement in the AI-based service largely stem from human involvement serving as a peripheral cue that enhances the affective appeal of the advice. Our findings indicate that regulations and guidelines should adopt a consumer-centric approach by fostering environments where human capabilities and AI systems can synergize effectively to benefit consumers while safeguarding consumer welfare. These nuanced insights are crucial for managers who face decisions about offering pure AI versus human–AI collaborative services and also for regulators advocating for having humans in the loop.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>The Best Decisions Are Not the Best Advice: Making Adherence-Aware Recommendations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many high-stake decisions follow an expert-in-loop structure in that a human operator receives recommendations from an algorithm but is the ultimate decision maker. Hence, the algorithm’s recommendation may differ from the actual decision implemented in practice. However, most algorithmic recommendations are obtained by solving an optimization problem that assumes recommendations will be perfectly implemented. We propose an adherence-aware optimization framework to capture the dichotomy between the recommended and the implemented policy and analyze the impact of partial adherence on the optimal recommendation. Our framework provides useful tools to analyze the structure and to compute optimal recommendation policies that are naturally immune against such human deviations and are guaranteed to improve upon the baseline policy.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier-Moses, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rapid technological developments in online markets fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and sellers. Online platforms can easily gather data about consumers’ search behavior, allowing for price discrimination. Therefore, product search becomes a strategic choice. Consumers face a tradeoff: Search intensely and receive a better fit at a potentially higher price or restrict search behavior, be strategically inattentive, and receive a worse fit but maybe a better deal. We study the resulting strategic buyer-seller interaction theoretically and experimentally. Our experimental results shed a critical light on the added value for consumers through the rise of online platforms and on the effectiveness of current regulations.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the ZEW–Leibniz-Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung, and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03413 .</content>

    <title>Learning to Be Fair: A Consequentialist Approach to Equitable Decision Making</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an attempt to make algorithms fair, the machine learning literature has largely focused on equalizing decisions, outcomes, or error rates across race or gender groups. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical government rideshare program that provides transportation assistance to low-income people with upcoming court dates. Following this literature, one might allocate rides to those with the highest estimated treatment effect per dollar while constraining spending to be equal across race groups. That approach, however, ignores the downstream consequences of such constraints and, as a result, can induce unexpected harm. For instance, if one demographic group lives farther from court, enforcing equal spending would necessarily mean fewer total rides provided and potentially more people penalized for missing court. Here we present an alternative framework for designing equitable algorithms that foregrounds the consequences of decisions. In our approach, one first elicits stakeholder preferences over the space of possible decisions and the resulting outcomes—such as preferences for balancing spending parity against court appearance rates. We then optimize over the space of decision policies, making trade-offs in a way that maximizes the elicited utility. To do so, we develop an algorithm for efficiently learning these optimal policies from data for a large family of expressive utility functions. In particular, we use a contextual bandit algorithm to explore the space of policies while solving a convex optimization problem at each step to estimate the best policy based on the available information. This consequentialist paradigm facilitates a more holistic approach to equitable decision making.This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Stanford Impact Labs [Start-Up Impact Labs/GEJBU], the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, and Harvard Data Science Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00345 .</content>

    <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for Human-Guided Human-Machine Interaction with Private Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the human-machine interaction such as recommending videos for improving customer engagement, we study human-guided human-machine interaction for decision making with private information. We model this interaction as a two-player turn-based game, where one player (Bob, a human) guides the other player (Alice, a machine) toward a common goal. Specifically, we focus on offline reinforcement learning (RL) in this game, where the goal is to find a policy pair for Alice and Bob that maximizes their expected total rewards based on an offline data set collected a priori. The offline setting presents two challenges: (i) We cannot collect Bob’s private information, leading to a confounding bias when using standard RL methods, and (ii) there is a distributional mismatch between the behavior policy used to collect data and the desired optimal policy we aim to learn. To tackle the confounding bias, we treat Bob’s previous action as an instrumental variable for Alice’s current decision making to adjust for the unmeasured confounding. We establish a novel identification result and propose a new off-policy evaluation (OPE) method for evaluating policy pairs in this two-player turn-based game. To tackle the distributional mismatch, we leverage the idea of pessimism and use our OPE method to develop an off-policy policy learning algorithm for finding a desirable policy pair for both Alice and Bob. Moreover, we prove that under some technical assumptions, the policy pair obtained through our method converges to the optimal one at a satisfactory rate. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: L.

    <title>Reskilling the Workforce for AI: Domain Expertise and Algorithmic Literacy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides evidence that AI and algorithms act as complements to domain expertise, creating the greatest value when algorithmic literacy is broadly diffused among workers. Unlike earlier business technologies that concentrated expertise in IT specialists, AI and algorithms are most effective when domain experts themselves can interpret and apply them. Using two workforce datasets, I show that demand for algorithmic skills is rising among domain experts, frontier firms diffuse these skills broadly, and markets reward firms’ AI and algorithmic investments more when such capabilities are dispersed. The spread of no-code and natural language tools accelerates this shift by lowering barriers to use and allowing domain experts to integrate algorithms into their decision-making processes. These patterns underscore the importance of workforce training and organizational design in realizing productivity gains from AI adoption.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Human–Algorithmic Bias: Source, Evolution, and Impact</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior work on human-algorithmic bias has seen difficulty in empirically identifying the underlying mechanisms of bias because in a typical “one-time” decision-making scenario, different mechanisms generate the same patterns of observable decisions. In this study, leveraging a unique repeat decision-making setting in a high-stakes microlending context, we aim to uncover the underlying source, evolution dynamics, and associated impacts of bias. We first develop a structural econometric model of the decision dynamics to understand the source and evolution of bias in human evaluators in microloan granting. We find that both preference-based and belief-based biases exist in human decisions and are in favor of female applicants. Our counterfactual simulations show that the elimination of either of the two biases improves the fairness in financial resource allocation as well as the platform profits. The profit improvement mainly stems from the increased approval probability for male borrowers, especially those who would eventually pay back loans. Furthermore, to examine how human biases evolve when being inherited by machine learning (ML) algorithms, we train state-of-the-art ML algorithms for default risk prediction on both real-world data sets with human biases encoded within and counterfactual data sets with human biases partially or fully removed. We find that even fairness-unaware ML algorithms can reduce bias in human decisions. Interestingly, although removing both types of human bias from the training data can further improve ML fairness, the fairness-enhancing effects vary significantly between new and repeat applicants. Based on our findings, we discuss how to reduce decision bias most effectively in a human-ML pipeline.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The low rate of adoption by human users often hinders AI algorithms from achieving their intended efficiency gains. This is particularly true for algorithms that prioritize system-wide objectives because they can create misalignment of incentives and cause confusion among potential users. We provide one of the first large-scale field studies on algorithm aversion by leveraging an algorithmic recommendation rollout on a large ridesharing platform. We identify contextual experience and herding as two important factors that explain ridesharing drivers’ aversion to an algorithm that is designed to help drivers make better location choices. Specifically, we find that drivers are less likely to follow the algorithm when the algorithmic recommendation does not align with their past experience at a given location-time unit and when their peers’ actions contradict the algorithmic recommendations. We discuss the managerial implications of these findings.This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: The research at Shanghai Jiaotong University was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72202135, 72110107001, 72231003].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze statistical discrimination in hiring markets using a multiarmed bandit model. Myopic firms face workers arriving with heterogeneous observable characteristics. The association between the worker’s skill and characteristics is unknown ex ante; thus, firms need to learn it. Laissez-faire causes perpetual underestimation: minority workers are rarely hired, and therefore, the underestimation tends to persist. Even a marginal imbalance in the population ratio frequently results in perpetual underestimation. We demonstrate that a subsidy rule that is implemented as temporary affirmative action effectively alleviates discrimination stemming from insufficient data.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier-Moses, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 430-2020-00088] and JST ERATO [Grant JPMJER2301], Japan.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00893 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We run an online experiment to study the origins of algorithm aversion. Participants are in the role of either workers or managers. Workers perform three real-effort tasks: task 1, task 2, and the job task, which is a combination of tasks 1 and 2. They choose whether the hiring decision between themselves and another worker is made by a participant in the role of a manager or by an algorithm. In a second set of experiments, managers choose whether they want to delegate their hiring decisions to the algorithm. When the algorithm does not use workers’ gender to predict their job-task performance and workers know this, they choose the algorithm more often than in the baseline treatment where gender is employed. Feedback to the managers about their performance in hiring the best workers increases their preference for the algorithm relative to the baseline without feedback, because managers are, on average, overconfident. Finally, providing details on how the algorithm works does not increase the preference for the algorithm for workers or for managers.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we report the results from a large-scale field experiment at a spare parts retail chain that considers whether allowing merchants to override forecast inputs to an inventory algorithm improves profits. Although the judgmental forecasting literature has studied extensively whether judgmental adjustments improve forecast performance, causal empirical evidence is missing in regard to whether judgmental adjustments improve bottom-line profits. Our results show that judgmental adjustments to the forecast input increase profitability by 4.92% on average compared with relying on automation without human intervention. We find that the well-established motivation-opportunity-ability framework provides clear insight into when judgmental adjustments improve profits, by examining heterogeneity in our data regarding stock-keeping unit margin, lifecycle, and size of supplier. Our data set also allows for examining both forecast accuracy and profits. We empirically support the wisdom from the judgmental forecasting literature that forecast performance need not translate to profit performance, calling attention to the need to consider operational performance beyond forecast accuracy as an end in itself.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06321 .</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Precision and Human Decision: A Study of Interactive Optimization for School Schedules</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In collaboration with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), this paper introduces an interactive optimization framework to tackle complex school scheduling challenges. The choice of school start and end times is an optimization challenge, as schedules influence the district’s transportation system, and limiting the associated costs is a computationally difficult combinatorial problem. However, it is also a policy challenge, as transportation costs are far from the only consequence of school schedule changes. Policymakers need time and knowledge to balance these considerations and reach a consensus carefully; past implementations have failed because of policy issues, despite state-of-the-art optimization approaches. We first motivate our approach with a microfoundation model of the interplay between policymakers and researchers, arguing that limiting their dependency is key. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that includes (1) a fast algorithm capable of solving the school schedule problem that compares favorably to the literature and (2) an interactive optimization approach that leverages this speed to allow policymakers to explore a variety of solutions in a transparent and efficient way, facilitating the policy decision-making process. The framework led to the first optimization-driven school start time changes in the United States, updating the schedule of all 133 schools in SFUSD in 2021, with annual transportation savings exceeding $5 million. A comprehensive survey of approximately 27,000 parents and staff in 2022 provides evidence of the approach’s effectiveness.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05834 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of gamification on retail traders’ behavior using a randomized online experiment. Participants with lower financial literacy prefer platforms with hedonic gamification elements, such as confetti and achievement badges. On average, hedonic gamification increases trading volume by 5.17%. However, the difference in trading activity between gamified and nongamified platforms is driven primarily by self-selection (70%) rather than gamification (30%). Participants who prefer hedonic gamification exhibit noisy trading strategies, whereas those favoring nongamified platforms display stronger contrarian behavior. Further, price trend notifications enhance learning for investors with accurate beliefs, but they reinforce trading mistakes for those with incorrect beliefs.This paper was accepted by Jean-Edouard Colliard, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In credit markets, screening algorithms aim to discriminate between good-type and bad-type borrowers. However, when doing so, they can also discriminate between individuals sharing a protected attribute (e.g., gender, age, racial origin) and the rest of the population. This can be unintentional and originate from the training data set or from the model itself. We show how to formally test the algorithmic fairness of scoring models and how to identify the variables responsible for any lack of fairness. We then use these variables to optimize the fairness-performance tradeoff. Our framework provides guidance on how algorithmic fairness can be monitored by lenders, controlled by their regulators, improved for the benefit of protected groups, while still maintaining a high level of forecasting accuracy.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) Chair in Regulation and Systemic Risk, the Fintech Chair at Dauphine-PSL University, and the French National Research Agency (ANR) [MLEforRisk ANR-21-CE26-0007, Ecodec ANR-11-LABX-0047, and F-STAR ANR-17-CE26-0007-01].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03888 .</content>

    <title>Human-Algorithm Collaboration with Private Information: Naïve Advice-Weighting Behavior and Mitigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even if algorithms make better predictions than humans on average, humans may sometimes have private information that an algorithm does not have access to that can improve performance. How can we help humans effectively use and adjust recommendations made by algorithms in such situations? When deciding whether and how to override an algorithm’s recommendations, we hypothesize that people are biased toward following naïve advice-weighting (NAW) behavior; they take a weighted average between their own prediction and the algorithm’s prediction, with a constant weight across prediction instances regardless of whether they have valuable private information. This leads to humans overadhering to the algorithm’s predictions when their private information is valuable and underadhering when it is not. In an online experiment where participants were tasked with making demand predictions for 20 products while having access to an algorithm’s predictions, we confirm this bias toward NAW and find that it leads to a 20%–61% increase in prediction error. In a second experiment, we find that feature transparency—even when the underlying algorithm is a black box—helps users more effectively discriminate how to deviate from algorithms, resulting in a 25% reduction in prediction error. We make further improvements in a third experiment via an intervention designed to move users away from advice weighting and instead, use only their private information to inform deviations, leading to a 34% reduction in prediction error.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03850 .</content>

    <title>Engaging Customers with AI in Online Chats: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how artificial intelligence (AI) affected the productivity of customer service agents and customer sentiment in online interactions. Collaborating with a meal delivery company, we conducted a randomized field experiment that exploited exogenous variation in giving agents access to AI-generated suggestions. We found that AI improved both the efficiency and effectiveness of the interactions: AI-assisted agents responded faster, engaged customers more deeply, and achieved greater improvements in customer sentiment. The benefits were most pronounced for less-experienced agents. However, AI’s impact varied by conversation type: It improved efficiency and customer sentiment in subscription cancellation requests but was the least effective in repeat complaint scenarios because of systemic issues beyond the AI’s capability. A text analysis of agent messages suggests that improved customer sentiment was explained by AI-assisted agents exhibiting higher levels of key response characteristics: empathy, information, and solution. Furthermore, we exploit a unique data feature: Customers first chatted with an automated chatbot without any human intervention before they were transferred to human agents (who may or may not have had AI assistance). We found that if customers who had experienced chatbot comprehension failures were then connected to AI-assisted human agents, the involvement of AI negatively affected customer sentiment. This is because unusually rapid responses in the latter scenario led customers to believe they were still communicating with a chatbot only, suggesting a spillover from their initial negative chatbot experiences. Companies should understand the conversation contexts, such as customer intent and chatbot interactions, when integrating AI into their customer support strategies.This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This research was supported by funding provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03920 .</content>

    <title>Identity Disclosure and Anthropomorphism in Voice Chatbot Design: A Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fueled by the widespread adoption of algorithms and artificial intelligence, the use of chatbots has become increasingly popular in various business contexts. In this paper, we study how to effectively and appropriately use voice chatbots, particularly by leveraging the two design features identity disclosure and anthropomorphism, and evaluate their impact on the firm operational performance. In collaboration with a large truck-sharing platform, we conducted a field experiment that randomly assigned 11,000 truck drivers to receive outbound calls from the voice chatbot dispatcher of our focal platform. Our empirical results suggest that disclosing the identity of the chatbot at the beginning of the conversation negatively affects operational performance, leading to around 11% reduction in the response probability. However, humanizing the voice chatbot by adding our proposed anthropomorphism features (i.e., interjections and filler words) significantly improves response probability, conversation length, and the probability of order acceptance intention by over 5.6%, 24.9%, and 10.1%, respectively. Moreover, even when the chatbot’s identity is disclosed along with humanizing features, the operational outcomes still improve. This finding suggests that enhancing anthropomorphism may potentially counteract the negative effects of chatbot identity disclosure. Finally, we propose one plausible explanation for the performance improvement—the enhanced trust between humans and algorithms—and provide empirical evidence that drivers are more likely to disclose information to chatbot dispatchers with anthropomorphism features. Our proposed anthropomorphism improvement solutions are currently being implemented and utilized by our collaborator platform.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72172169 and 91646125], Program for Innovation Research at the Central University of Finance and Economic, and Shanghai Pujiang Program.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03833 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans will see significant changes in the future of work as collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) will become commonplace. This work explores the benefits of AI in the setting of judgment tasks when it replaces humans (automation) and when it works with humans (augmentation). Through an analytical modeling framework, we show that the optimal use of AI for automation or augmentation depends on different types of human-AI complementarity. Our analysis demonstrates that the use of automation increases with higher levels of between-task complementarity. In contrast, the use of augmentation increases with higher levels of within-task complementarity. We integrate both automation and augmentation roles into our task allocation framework, where an AI and humans work on a set of judgment tasks to optimize performance with a given level of available human resources. We validate our framework with an empirical study based on experimental data in which humans classify images with and without AI support. When between-task complementarity and within-task complementarity exist, we see a consistent distribution of work pattern for optimal work configurations; AI automates relatively easy tasks, AI augments humans on tasks with similar human and AI performance, and humans work without AI on relatively difficult tasks. Our work provides several contributions to theory and practice. The findings on the effects of complementarity provide a nuanced view regarding the benefits of automation and augmentation. Our task allocation framework highlights potential job designs for the future of work, especially by considering the often-ignored, critical role of human resource reallocation in improving organizational performance.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>The Power of Disagreement: A Field Experiment to Investigate Human–Algorithm Collaboration in Loan Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human–algorithm collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in the economy and society. However, this collaboration is not always fruitful, and in extreme cases, people become human borgs or totally averse to algorithms. The key to collaborative value is whether humans and algorithms can complement each other in decision making, but it is challenging for humans to disagree with algorithmic recommendations at the right time (i.e., to disagree when algorithms are wrong and not disagree when algorithms are right). To understand the centric role of disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration and examine when and how it benefits, we conducted a field experiment in which human evaluators and algorithms worked together to evaluate loan applications under four scenarios, that is, limited/rich information and with/without disclosure of algorithm rationale. Our results show that human–algorithm collaboration decisions outperformed human- or algorithm-only decisions, and these collaborative values varied across the four scenarios. We further propose a theoretical framework for mechanism examination that centers on the formation and effectiveness of disagreement. We validate the framework empirically and come to the following findings: (1) disagreement exhibits a sizable and nonlinear influence on collaborative value, (2) the differences between human evaluators and algorithms in decision making contribute to disagreement but not to collaborative value, (3) algorithm self-contradiction triggers disagreement and helps human evaluators disagree with algorithms at the right time. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights on how collaborative value is achieved and managerial insights on how to manage disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the pairing of audio chatbot technologies with voice-based deep fakes, that is, voice clones, examining the potential of this combination to induce consumer trust. We report on a set of controlled experiments based on the investment game, evaluating how voice cloning and chatbot disclosure jointly affect participants’ trust, reflected by their willingness to play with an autonomous, AI-enabled partner. We observe evidence that voice-based agents garner significantly greater trust from subjects when imbued with a clone of the subject’s voice. Recognizing that these technologies present not only opportunities but also the potential for misuse, we further consider the moderating impact of AI disclosure, a recent regulatory proposal advocated by some policymakers. We find no evidence that AI disclosure attenuates the trust-inducing effect of voice clones. Finally, we explore underlying mechanisms and contextual moderators for the trust-inducing effects, with an eye toward informing future efforts to manage and regulate voice-cloning applications. We find that a voice clone’s effects operate, at least in part, by inducing a perception of homophily and that the effects are increasing in the clarity and quality of generated audio. Implications of these results for consumers, policymakers, and society are discussed.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the introduction of robo-advising on a large set of employee saving plans. Different from many services that fully automate portfolio decisions, our robo-advisor proposes investment and rebalancing strategies, leaving investors free to follow or ignore them. The resulting human-robot interactions occur both at the time of the subscription and over time, as the robot sends alerts when the investor’s portfolio gets too far from the target allocation. We show that the robo-service is associated with an increase in investors’ attention and trading activities. Following the robot’s alerts, investors change their rebalancing behaviors so as to stay closer to their target allocation, which results in larger portfolio returns. Counterfactual returns induced by automatic rebalancing by the robot would be only slightly higher, suggesting that, on average, the financial cost of letting investors retain control is not large.This paper was accepted by Jean-Edouard Colliard, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Observatoire epargne europeenne, as well as LTI@Unito and Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grant ANR-17-EURE-0010] to M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We investigate why some firms succeed in using AI for innovation, whereas others fail, focusing on the organizational support necessary for leveraging AI in both novel and incremental innovation. Specifically, we examine how the lean startup method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping—focused on developing minimum viable products—and controlled experimentation—focused on rigorous testing such as A/B testing. We find that LSM complements discovery-oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using A/B testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high-quality products in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct because different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Is Your Machine Better Than You? You May Never Know</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly demonstrating their capacity to make better predictions than human experts. Yet recent studies suggest that professionals sometimes doubt the quality of these systems and overrule machine-based prescriptions. This paper explores the extent to which a decision maker (DM) supervising a machine to make high-stakes decisions can properly assess whether the machine produces better recommendations. To that end, we study a setup in which a machine performs repeated decision tasks (e.g., whether to perform a biopsy) under the DM’s supervision. Because stakes are high, the DM primarily focuses on making the best choice for the task at hand. Nonetheless, as the DM observes the correctness of the machine’s prescriptions across tasks, the DM updates the DM’s belief about the machine. However, the DM is subject to a so-called verification bias such that the DM verifies the machine’s correctness and updates the DM’s belief accordingly only if the DM ultimately decides to act on the task. In this setup, we characterize the evolution of the DM’s belief and overruling decisions over time. We identify situations under which the DM hesitates forever whether the machine is better; that is, the DM never fully ignores but regularly overrules it. Moreover, the DM sometimes wrongly believes with positive probability that the machine is better. We fully characterize the conditions under which these learning failures occur and explore how mistrusting the machine affects them. These findings provide a novel explanation for human–machine complementarity and suggest guidelines on the decision to fully adopt or reject a machine.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4791 .</content>

    <title>The Gatekeeper Effect: The Implications of Pre-Screening, Self-Selection, and Bias for Hiring Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the problem of screening in decision-making processes under uncertainty, while focusing on the impact of adding an additional screening stage, commonly known as a “gatekeeper.” Although our main analysis is rooted in the context of job market hiring, the principles and findings are broadly applicable to areas such as educational admissions, patient healthcare selection, and financial loan approvals. The gatekeeper’s role is to assess applicant suitability before significant costs are incurred. Our study reveals that although gatekeepers are designed to streamline selection processes by filtering out the candidates who are less likely to be selected, sometimes they inadvertently affect the candidate’s own decision-making process. We explore the conditions under which the introduction of a gatekeeper can enhance or impede the efficiency of these processes. Additionally, we consider how gatekeeping strategies can be adapted to influence the accuracy of selection decisions. Our research also extends to scenarios in which gatekeeping is influenced by historical biases, particularly in competitive settings like hiring. We discover that candidates confronted with a statistically biased gatekeeping process are more likely to withdraw from the job application process, thereby perpetuating the previously mentioned historical biases. The study suggests that measures such as affirmative action can effectively address these biases. Although centered on hiring, the insights and methodologies from our study have significant implications for a wide range of fields to which screening and gatekeeping are integral.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier-Moses, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: Financial support from the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (CMSA) at Harvard University and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Israel (Yitzhak Shamir Fellowship) is gratefully acknowledged.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the interaction between algorithmic advice and human decisions using high-resolution hotel-room pricing data. We document that price setting frictions, arising from adjustment costs of human decision makers, induce a conflict of interest with the algorithmic advisor. A model of advice with costly price adjustments shows that, in equilibrium, algorithmic price recommendations are strategically biased and lead to suboptimal pricing by human decision makers. We quantify the losses from the strategic bias in recommendations using as structural model and estimate the potential benefits that would result from a shift to fully automated algorithmic pricing.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender discrimination in education hinders women’s representation in various fields. How can we create a gender-neutral learning environment when teachers’ gender composition and mindset are slow to change? Recent development in artificial intelligence (AI) provides a way to achieve this goal as engineers can make AI trainers gender neutral and not take gender-related information as input. We use data from a natural experiment in which such AI trainers replace some human teachers for a male-dominated strategic board game to test the effectiveness of AI training. The introduction of AI improves teaching outcomes for boys and girls and reduces the preexisting gender gap. Survey responses indicate that AI’s information advantage, friendly appearance, and interactive features helped students to learn faster, and class recordings suggest that AI trainers’ nondiscriminatory emotional status can explain the improvement in gender equality. We demonstrate AI’s potential in improving learning outcomes and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in analogous settings.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In algorithm-augmented service contexts where workers have decision authority, they face two decisions about the algorithm: whether to follow its advice and how quickly to do so. The pressure to work quickly increases with the speed of arriving customers. In this paper, we ask the following. How do workers use algorithms to manage system loads? With a laboratory experiment, we find that superior algorithm quality and high system loads increase participants’ willingness to use their algorithm’s advice. Consequently, participants with the superior algorithm make higher-quality recommendations than those with no algorithm (participants with the inferior algorithm make slightly lower-quality recommendations than those without). However, participants do not necessarily speed up by using algorithms’ advice; their throughput times only decrease compared with the no-algorithm baseline when the system load is high and algorithm quality is superior, although participants would benefit from working faster in all treatments. This happens in part because participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment serve customers more quickly than participants in the other treatments, conditional on using the algorithm. Participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment work especially quickly in later periods as they increasingly default to their algorithm’s advice. Our findings show that algorithms can have benefits for both decision quality and speed. Quality benefits come from workers’ decision to use their algorithms’ advice, whereas speed benefits depend on workers’ algorithm use and the time they spend deliberating about their algorithm use. Ultimately, algorithm quality and system load are mutually reinforcing factors that influence both service quality and especially speed.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01989 .</content>

    <title>Gender-Biased Technological Change: Milking Machines and the Exodus of Women from Farming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how gender-biased technological change in agriculture affected women’s work in twentieth-century Norway. In the 1950s, dairy farms began widely adopting milking machines to replace milking cows by hand, a task typically performed by young women. We show that the machines pushed rural young women in dairy-intensive areas out of farming. The displaced women moved to cities where they acquired more education and found better-paying, skilled employment. Our results suggest that the adoption of milking machines broke up allocative inefficiencies associated with moving costs across sectors, which improved the economic status of women relative to men.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a leverage theory of tying in markets with network effects. When a monopolist in one market cannot perfectly extract surplus from consumers, tying can be a mechanism through which unexploited consumer surplus is used as a demand-side leverage to create a “quasi-installed base” advantage in another market characterized by network effects. Our mechanism does not require any precommitment to tying; rather, tying emerges as a best response that lowers the quality of tied-market rivals. While tying can lead to exclusion of tied-market rivals, it can also expand use of the tying product, leading to ambiguous welfare effects. (JEL D41, D85, K21, L15, L40)</content>

    <title>Sequential Learning under Informational Ambiguity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates a sequential social learning problem in which individuals face ambiguity about others’ signal structures and have max-min expected utility preferences, thereby exhibiting ambiguity aversion. Unlike previous findings, which suggest that learning outcomes depend on the specifics of the learning environment, this study establishes information cascades as a robust outcome under ambiguity. With sufficient ambiguity, cascades arise almost surely, regardless of the statistical properties of signal structures. Moreover, standard results predicting the absence of cascades can easily break down: Even minimal ambiguity can trigger cascades when signals are bounded and lead to incorrect herding when signals are unbounded.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that higher rates of distressed home sales (i.e., foreclosures and short sales) among Black and Hispanic homeowners severely reduce realized housing returns for these groups—in particular, to a level below that realized by White homeowners. Yet absent financial distress, houses owned by minorities do not appreciate at substantially slower rates than houses owned by nonminorities. Racial differences in liquidity and income stability, which are imperfectly observed by lenders, are important determinants of differences in distress. Policies that prevent foreclosure among distressed minorities can mitigate the racial gap in returns. (JEL D31, G51, J15, R31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should optimal income taxation change when firms have market power? We analyze how the planner can optimally tax labor income of workers and profits of entrepreneurs. We derive optimal tax rates that depend on markups and identify four distinct components: the Mirrleesian incentive effect, the Pigouvian tax correction of the negative externality of market power, redistribution through altered factor prices, and reallocation of output toward the most productive firms. We quantify the optimal tax for the US economy and provide concrete proposals how to use income taxation to redistribute income while incentivizing production in the presence of market power.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using new methods, we measure the intensities of higher-order risk preferences (prudence and temperance) in an incentivized experiment with 658 adolescents. Aligned with theory, we find that higher-order risk preferences are strongly related to field behavior, including prevention, health, addictive behavior, and financial decision-making. Most importantly, we show that ignoring prudence and temperance can yield misleading conclusions about the relation of risk preferences to field behavior, and that survey measures of risk tolerance often relate to field behavior because they capture higher-order risk preferences.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many employers link wages at establishments outside of the home region to the level at headquarters. We show this using new data on 1,200 multinationals’ establishments across the world and linked employee-level data on their establishments in Brazil. Headquarters wage changes arising from minimum wage and exchange rate shocks are partially transmitted to workers employed in the same position abroad. Wage change transmission appears to be direct and results from firm-wide wage-setting procedures rather than associated technology or employment changes. “Anchored” wage setting is somewhat associated with particular characteristics of the job × employer × headquarters-establishment country-pair.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal monetary policy during times of global scarcity of tradable goods. The optimal monetary response entails a surge in inflation, which helps rebalance production toward the tradable sector. While the inflation costs are fully borne domestically, however, the gains in terms of higher supply of tradable goods partly spill over to the rest of the world. National central banks may thus fall into a coordination trap and implement an excessively tight monetary policy causing an unnecessarily sharp global contraction.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a public atlas of mean outcomes in adulthood by childhood census tract. Outcomes vary sharply across neighborhoods: For children whose parents earn $27,000, the standard deviation of mean household income in adulthood is $10,420 across tracts within counties. Only half the variation in outcomes is explained by traditional measures of neighborhood opportunity like poverty rates. Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates indicate 60 percent of the variation in outcomes across neighborhoods is driven by causal effects. We demonstrate how our statistics can be applied to better target policies to improve low-opportunity areas and help families move to affordable high-opportunity areas.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Judge IV designs rely on monotonicity—each judge being weakly stricter than more lenient judges in all cases. I measure monotonicity in judicial panels in five different settings and find that it is violated in up to 50 percent of nonunanimous cases. The monotonicity violations are not detected by conventional tests, but they would typically induce little bias in judge IV estimates. (JEL C26, K41, K42, O17)</content>

    <title>Curious and analytical: How analysts evaluate and respond to executive communications about firm strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do analysts react to communication about firms' strategies? Research has shown that executive communication influences markets, but we know little about reactions to the deeper strategy content communicated. Drawing from research on how evaluative frames and expectation violations shape cognition, we show that when executives focus on growth strategies, analysts react by becoming more curious and analytically intensive. These changes in cognition partially mediate a positive effect on analysts' evaluations. Further, we consider two situations that reveal how analysts react to information that reinforces or violates their expectations, demonstrating different analyst reactions to similar strategies among S&amp;P 500 firms. In doing so, we contribute new theory about how the evaluative assumptions of these influential market actors change and can be influenced by managerial framing.Managerial SummaryThis paper focuses on how securities analysts react to executive communications about their business' strategies. We know that top executive communications influence markets, but this paper probes further to understand reactions to the specific strategies that are communicated. We show that when executives focus on new growth strategies, this piques analyst interest. Specifically, we find that this makes analysts more curious and analytically intensive, thereby shaping their forecasts and evaluations. However, we find that analyst reactions also depend on how well the strategies that executives talk about fit with what is expected from the company. When the strategy articulated aligns with expectations, firms are rewarded with yet stronger evaluations. In contrast, when a strategy does not align with expectations, firms are punished with lower evaluations.</content>

    <title>On the Expansion of Risk Pooling</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Risk pooling has become an increasingly critical tool for managing risks among corporations, institutions, states, and nations, with examples including multinational pooling, decentralized insurance schemes, catastrophe risk pooling, and burden sharing for nuclear accidents. Although there has been a rich literature on such practices, little is known from a theoretical viewpoint regarding the operational strategies of risk pools and, in particular, on issues about the effect of a pool’s expansion on each existing member’s welfare. This paper is the first to explore these issues by establishing different notions of consensus for the expansion of a risk pool: strong consensus, where both existing members and new candidates improve their risk measures due to the pool’s expansion, and weak consensus, which refers to the willingness of existing members to remain in the pool. Under optimal risk sharing for each pool, we show that its properties regarding expansion’s effects depend strongly on the underlying pricing rule. For instance, only with risk-adjusted equilibrium pricing are existing members willing to accept highly risky new members, whereas simple linear pricing excludes such members from the pool. Additionally, the impact of exogenous reinsurance on consensus is analyzed under both pricing rules. The established framework offers valuable managerial insights and policy implications, which we illustrate through two indicative case studies based on real data.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: Financial support from the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management [Research Grant 2023051001], the National Social Sciences Foundation of China [Major Grant 23&amp;ZD178] is gratefully acknowledged, and the Tsinghua University Independent Research Grant [2024THZWYY02].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06863 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing use of information communication technology (ICT) has made telepressure, the urge to reply quickly to work‐related messages, a common experience among today's employees. By integrating theoretical underpinnings of conservation of resources with rumination literature, we posit that after‐hours telepressure leads to a resource‐loss process via evening affective rumination, as this type of rumination increases next‐morning emotional exhaustion. In the meantime, after‐hours telepressure enables a resource‐gain process via evening problem‐solving pondering, as this type of rumination promotes next‐morning cognitive flexibility. Moreover, we argue that leader path‐goal facilitation, leader behaviors that facilitate employees' goal achievement by providing guidance and removing obstacles, alleviates the impact of after‐hours telepressure on employees' next‐morning emotional exhaustion by reducing their evening affective rumination and strengthens the positive effect of after‐hours telepressure on employees' next‐morning cognitive flexibility by increasing their evening problem‐solving pondering. Through a 10‐day experience sampling investigation of 81 employees working in various industries in China (i.e., Study 1) and a 5‐day experience sampling investigation of 95 employees in an e‐commerce company in Singapore (i.e., Study 2), we find support for most of our hypotheses. As a whole, by providing a more balanced account of the consequences of after‐hours telepressure from the COR perspective, our work advances extant management literature and offers novel practical insights in terms that companies can help employees suffer less and even benefit from telepressure by enhancing leaders' levels of path‐goal facilitation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While cultural entrepreneurship research has highlighted how entrepreneurs craft stories to legitimize their ventures, we know much less about how entrepreneurs gain legitimacy for a novel organizational form. Drawing upon a detailed, historical examination of Japanese family mottos from the Edo period (1603–1868), we show how stories embedded in family mottos enabled legitimation by symbolically leveraging two core socio-cultural institutions of Edo Japan (religion and family), advancing our understanding of how broader cultural resources can be leveraged to legitimate a new organizational form. We discuss implications for scholarship on family business and cultural entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs make critical decisions in uncertain environments where information is limited, outcomes are difficult to predict, and multiple goals often compete. Yet, existing research offers scattered insights into how entrepreneurs dynamically adapt to such contexts and how their decisions are shaped by behavioral and cognitive foundations such as judgment, intuition, and experience. We shed light on these phenomena by exploring how decision‐making is influenced by factors at multiple levels, from individual traits and family dynamics to team interactions and organizational structures. A key aspect of our inquiry focuses on how entrepreneurs manage uncertainty by balancing economic goals, such as growth and profitability, with non‐economic objectives like social impact, sustainability, or knowledge advancement. By integrating these perspectives, this work offers a conceptual framework that connects antecedents, processes, and outcomes of entrepreneurial decision‐making under uncertainty and competing goals, providing a promising roadmap for future research.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often make decisions in uncertain environments, where they must contend with limited information and competing goals. This work explores how entrepreneurs balance economic objectives, such as profit, with non‐economic ones, like satisfying various stakeholders, achieving social impact, and sustainability. It highlights the role of individual, family, team, and organizational factors in shaping these decisions, offering novel insights into how entrepreneurs can manage trade‐offs, adapt feedback‐based strategies, and recalibrate priorities over time. For owners, managers, and business leaders, understanding these dynamics can lead to better decision‐making, improved risk management, enhanced strategic alignment, increased innovation, and a more balanced approach to growth.</content>

    <title>Managers' Decisions About Informal Accommodation Requests by Employees With and Without Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although formal accommodations are required by law across many jurisdictions, many employees seek informal adjustments to their work conditions. These individualized work arrangements are not rooted in legal compliance but are instead provided at managers' discretion. Employees without disabilities routinely ask for changes to their work conditions (e.g., flexible work arrangements), and these changes often mirror those requested by employees with disabilities. Using Social Exchange Theory as our conceptual lens, we examined the critical role of managers' decision‐making on informal accommodation requests through three policy‐capturing studies. As hypothesized, managers were more likely to grant informal accommodations to employees with longer tenure, stronger task performance, and more citizenship behaviors. Moreover, tenure consistently had the strongest influence on accommodation intentions. Managers were also more likely to grant informal accommodations for disability reasons than for family‐related reasons, contrary to our expectations. Our research offers novel insights into how managers view informal accommodation requests from employees with and without disabilities. This study provides crucial theoretical contributions to the human resource management literature and informs practical considerations on issues faced by managers and organizations.</content>

    <title>Bending Without Breaking: How Chinese Patent Examiners Navigate Value Tensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professionals increasingly work within commercial and governmental organizations whose mandates often create tensions with their professional values. Prior research, however, shows mixed findings regarding how professionals respond to these value tensions, with some values being protected and others being compromised. We explore this inconsistency by investigating how Chinese patent examiners navigate tensions between their professional values and governmental pressures to promote domestic strategic innovation under the Made in China 2025 policy. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative interviews with 27 Chinese patent examiners and quantitative analyses of nearly 1 million patents reviewed by 10,304 examiners, we develop a hierarchical framework of professional values. We find that examiners perceive their values hierarchically, distinguishing between core identity-defining values and subordinate operational values. Under external pressures, they attempt to protect their core value of judgmental fairness while absorbing the pressures by compromising their subordinate value of diagnosing diligence. Professional interactions with foreign examiners and experienced patent agents mitigate this compromise by anchoring examiners’ attention to the operational details where diagnosing diligence is embedded. Moreover, our quantitative analyses reveal that compromised diagnosing diligence ultimately undermines judgmental fairness due to interdependence within the value hierarchy. Our study advances the understanding of professional value dynamics under external pressures and provides insights into how experts balance their professional ideals with institutional mandates.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18504 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Price of Attention: Ranking Products for Maximum RevenueHow should an online retailer rank products when customers have limited attention spans? Chen, Li, and Yang tackle this classic problem by extending the well-known cascade model to account for two crucial, real-world factors: customers view only a random number of items, and the firm’s goal is to maximize revenue, not just clicks. This creates a difficult trade-off between ranking popular, low-price items and riskier, high-price ones. The authors propose the “Best-x” algorithm, an efficient method for finding a near-optimal ranking. They prove it guarantees a revenue of at least 1/e (approximately 37%) of that achievable by a clairvoyant who knows each customer’s attention span in advance. For cases where product attractiveness and attention distributions are unknown, the authors also devise the RankUCB online learning algorithm, which learns personalized rankings from customer interactions and achieves near-optimal performance over time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that traditional energy firms are key innovators in the United States’ green patent landscape. These firms produce more, and significantly higher-quality, green innovation. In many green technology spaces, they appear to be influential first movers and to produce ongoing foundational aspects of innovation and commercialization on which other alternative energy producers build. They additionally invest significantly in labor and capital to complement these green innovations. These traditional energy firms, however, receive significantly lower environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores and fund flows and are not rewarded for incremental green innovation. This behavior is consistent with a competitive response by traditional energy firms to preempt obsolescence of current technology by investing in future replacement technologies.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation [Grant SciSIP 1535813] and the Fordham University Gabelli School of Business—PVH Corp.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Patience has been a consistent source of interest and inspiration for generations of thinkers and writers. In this article, I delineate the tenets of a comprehensive framework for understanding patience, theprocess model of patience(Sweeny,Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2025, 29, 145), that positions impatience as a common and unpleasant emotion and patience as a targeted form of emotion regulation. I then outline potential applications of the model for consumer decisions, service experiences, and marketing contexts and close with practical recommendations to optimize consumer behavior in contexts where impatience is likely to arise.</content>

    <title>Sequential Sponsored-Products and Off-Amazon Advertising Optimization for Etailers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sponsored-Products (SP) advertising is a popular way to promote products on Amazon. Etailers who have a large catalog of products often create SP ad groups for products with similar attributes. An SP ad group consists of a set of products and a set of keywords, and all the products in the ad group share the same keyword set. These keywords are the ones that shoppers may search for when looking for products on Amazon. In addition to SP ads, etailers may link to external websites for advertising their products, which is called off-Amazon (OA) ads. This study focuses on the optimization of sequential SP and OA (abbreviated as SSPOA) ads decisions for etailers. Practically, many etailers set sales targets for products as manufacturing and logistics are planned ahead of time. Hence, we consider the etailer’s objective as minimizing the expected long-run average cost incurred by advertising and cumulative unmet sales target. We model the SSPOA optimization as a controlled Markovian multi-armed bandit (MAB) process. When the mean of the sales number per unit time (i.e., sales rate) for each product is known, we characterize the etailer’s optimal SSPOA policy for products in an ad group. In reality, etailers may not know the exact means of sales rates. To learn the unknown parameters while simultaneously minimizing the long-run average cost, we develop a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm for the controlled Markovian MAB problem that couples the SP and OA ads decisions. We prove that the regret bound of the proposed algorithm isO~(T), whereTis the total horizon length. Compared with existing literature, our problem additionally considers the regret from applying the estimated control policy and the impacts of choosing non-optimal keyword sets on subsequent states. We also conduct numerical experiments that validate our theoretical results. Moreover, we extend the base model in several directions, i.e., considering unknown transition rates between different sales rate levels, incorporating correlated keyword sets, and learning the optimal policy using Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning under a discretized setting.</content>

    <title>Street Orders as an Outside Option: Incentives and Information Disclosure of Taxi-Hailing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taxi drivers face tremendous market competition pressure in the private transport industry after independent contractor drivers (i.e., on-demand ride-hailing vehicles) entered the field, in the era of sharing economy. Taxi drivers have to go online and join platforms to secure demand. However, while ride-hailing drivers have platform orders as the only source of demand, taxi drivers can serve both platform andstreet orders(i.e., people waving on the roadside or waiting at taxi stands), and switch between the two on a real-time basis. The existence of street orders as anoutside optioncreates a decision problem for taxi drivers (i.e., which orders to pick) and forces platforms to carefullydesign incentives(e.g., commission and subsidy schemes) to attract taxi drivers in order to maximize profit. More interestingly, in common practices, platforms do not disclose trip destinations to ride-hailing drivers before customers get on board, to prevent cherry-picking behaviors (i.e., drivers only pick their preferred orders, for example, long-distance ones). However, many platforms provide trip information to taxi drivers in advance, as an incentive to compete against street order opportunities. Thus,taxi drivers need to choose between platform orders with trip information but also pick-up time (i.e., the unpaid driving duration to pick up customers) and street orders without trip information but zero pick-up time.This paper studies how a taxi driver should choose between platform and street orders, and how the platform should design incentives to attract taxi drivers in order to maximize profit. To this end, we build a game-theoretical model and derive optimal strategies. We find that it is optimal for the platform to allow drivers to serve both platform and street orders, rather than incentivizing exclusive service to platform. Since street orders exist as an outside option and protect drivers’ surplus, the platform’s profit will be limited if exclusivity is enforced. In addition, the disclosure of trip distance reduces the subsidy burden on the platform, compared to non-disclosure. Later in the paper, we also check the robustness of our findings under various settings, including homogeneous orders, zero commission and subsidy, distance-based subsidy scheme, and heterogeneous pick-up times.</content>

    <title>The Implications of Retail Trade-ins on Sales, Returns, and Profitability: An Empirical Analysis of a Jewelry Trade-in Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most retailers offer trade-in programs that allow customers not only to trade-in a used product in part payment for the purchase of a new one, but also to return the new product purchased via a trade-in. In this context, we study how a jewelry trade-in program affects sales and returns of trade-in eligible vs. ineligible new products, and how such programs can be better designed to improve profitability. We conduct an empirical analysis using data from a national jewelry retailer that increased the number of stores offering the trade-in program. Leveraging this expansion, we show that the trade-in program impacts sales and return rates, and find that this impact substantially differs across trade-in eligible vs. ineligible products. For trade-in eligible products, sales increase by 11.4%, and so do return rates - by 4.3 percentage points. For trade-in ineligible products, sales increase by 2.7% and there is no impact on return rates. The provision of a trade-in option reveals a novel trade-off for retailers: it leads to higher sales, but also results in greater returns, which can be detrimental to profitability. Retailers therefore need to carefully assess this trade-off to manage trade-in eligibility of different products. A counterfactual analysis suggests that a selective trade-in program accounting for this trade-off can enhance program profitability by 19%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform Disintermediation: Information Effects and Pricing RemediesIn “Platform Disintermediation: Information Effects and Pricing Remedies,” S. Sekar and A. Siddiq analyze how platforms use pricing and informational levers to combat disintermediation, where sellers transact off-platform to avoid commission fees despite losing payment protection. The authors find that a platform facing a high threat of disintermediation may optimally raise its commission rates in a high-information environment, prioritizing revenue maximization from remaining secure transactions rather than preventing all off-platform transactions. Furthermore, they show that increasing sellers’ switching costs may actually reduce platform revenue by enabling sellers to pass the cost onto on-platform buyers via higher prices. The analysis also demonstrates that a platform can benefit from providing a partially informative signal about buyer riskiness, as full information reduces the value of the platform’s protection and strengthens the disintermediation incentive. Finally, whereas access-based pricing (upfront fees) prevents disintermediation, it may yield less revenue than commissions when seller quality is highly heterogeneous.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the distinct configurations of contract characteristics associated with the success of inter‐organizational outsourcing projects across different technology paradigms? We examine information technology outsourcing contracts between 1991 and 2009 to address this question by using a relatively new approach based on qualitative comparative analysis. We consider four technology paradigms: pre‐Internet (1991–1996), pre‐Dotcom (1997–2000), post‐Dotcom (2001–2005), and Cloud Computing (2006–2009). We discuss issues related to adverse selection and moral hazard and identify five key contract characteristics that determine contract success: new contract, existing organizational relationship, long contract duration, fixed price, and competitive bidding. Our analyses document two key findings. First, we show that configurations of contract characteristics for success and failure of outsourcing projects are different across technology paradigms. Second, we identify three themes in configurations associated with outsourcing success—economic imperative, conservative relational, and conservative imperative. These themes extend prior work that draws on transaction cost economics, social exchange theory, and relational exchange theory and identify an increasing emphasis on the relational component to manage contracting risk for outsourcing success over time. From a managerial perspective, we provide context‐sensitive causal recipes to choose configurations of contract characteristics, considering technology paradigms. Together, our findings provide new insights for developing cumulative knowledge for understanding the determinants of success of interorganizational outsourcing projects while opening new avenues for further theorizing and empirical testing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relative pricing of nominal Treasury bonds and Treasury inflation‐protected securities in the presence of U.S. default risk. Hedged breakeven inflation is significantly positively related to U.S. default risk, driven by correlation between shocks to default risk and both shocks to inflation swap premia and Treasury yields. To understand the mechanisms through which default risk is related to inflation swaps and sovereign yields, we estimate an affine term structure model to capture their joint dynamics. Our estimation implies that the interaction between inflation dynamics and default is the primary source of differential pricing.</content>

    <title>The Elephant and Donkey in the Room: Time-Varying Effects of Political Dissimilarity on Social Interactions at Work During U.S. Elections</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Political polarization is recognized as a global risk. Although emerging studies on political dissimilarity at work highlight important implications for how employees behave and interact, findings are at times inconsistent. To provide a more nuanced understanding of when and why political dissimilarity disrupts workplace interactions, we draw on the social identity approach and threat processing to examine how political dissimilarity shapes perceptions of work relationships and behavior before and after election events. Across three studies, we demonstrate that political dissimilarity’s effects depend on political macro events and thus become temporally activated. Study 1, an experience sampling field study during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, showed no significant impact of political dissimilarity on negative interpersonal interactions before the election, but significance emerged on election day and persisted for six days after the election. In Study 2, an online experiment during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, we found that actual political dissimilarity indirectly influenced negative interpersonal interactions via reduced social mindfulness after the election but not beforehand. Study 3, a longitudinal experiment over four weeks during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, replicated the election effect, demonstrating that these effects persisted for at least two weeks and were mediated by cognitive (i.e., perspective-taking) and affective (i.e., empathic concern) subdimensions of social mindfulness. Our findings highlight political orientation as a critical dimension of workplace dissimilarity. Although its impact may be subdued, it becomes pronounced during macro-political events, shaping workplace interactions in significant ways, with the political dissimilarity effects being more easily reactivated in the postelection phase.Funding: Data collection was partially supported by an Add-on Fellowship for Interdisciplinary Economics and Interdisciplinary Business Administration from the Joachim Herz Foundation, awarded to M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm technological research has the potential to spawn multiple applications. Despite recognizing such potential, past literature disagrees on the process through which firms discover and grow new applications out of their past technological research. I examine this question in the context of deep learning, taking a question‐driven approach. Difference‐in‐difference analysis suggests that firms radically increased cumulative investments in past deep learning research upon signals indicating elevated application potential of deep learning. Furthermore, rather than investing in proprietary efforts, firms disclosed their cumulative development trajectories to engage external innovation efforts from which they learn and build. Grounded in these findings, I propose that the discovery and growth of new applications of past research entailsunfolding innovation interdependencewhich motivates firms to co‐evolve with external innovators.Managerial SummaryFirm technological research has the potential to spawn multiple applications. This article examines how firms cumulatively invest in their past technological research to grow new applications in the context of deep learning. Employing a difference‐in‐difference approach, analysis suggests that firms radically increased cumulative investments in deep learning after a shock elevating the application potential of their past deep‐learning research. Furthermore, firms publicly disclosed their cumulative development trajectories to attract innovation efforts from application sectors while actively learning from the attracted efforts to innovate further. These findings suggest that firms engaged, leveraged and co‐evolved with external innovation efforts to discover and grow new applications of their past research.</content>

    <title>Changing Opportunity: Sociological Mechanisms Underlying Growing Class Gaps and Shrinking Race Gaps in Economic Mobility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that intergenerational mobility changed rapidly by race and class in recent decades in the U.S. and study the causal mechanisms underlying those changes. Between the 1978 and 1992 birth cohorts, earnings increased for white children from high-income families relative to white children from low-income families, increasing earnings gaps by parental income (“class”) by 30%. Earnings increased for Black children at all parental income levels, reducing white-Black earnings gaps for children from low-income families by 30%. Class gaps grew and race gaps shrank similarly for non-monetary outcomes such as educational attainment, standardized test scores, and mortality rates. Using a quasi-experimental design, we show that the divergent trends in economic mobility were caused by differential changes in childhood environments, as proxied by parental employment rates, within local communities defined by race, class, and childhood county. Outcomes improve across birth cohorts for children who grow up in communities with increasing parental employment rates, with larger effects for children who move to such communities at younger ages. Children’s outcomes are most strongly related to the parental employment rates of peers they are more likely to interact with, such as those in their own birth cohort, suggesting that the relationship between children’s outcomes and parental employment rates is mediated by social interaction.</content>

    <title>Dual Demands, Attention, and Organizational Learning: Spatial and Temporal Replication of Routines in Scaling Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The replication of routines is fundamental to knowledge transfer and retention in organizations. Because research on routine replication has historically been divided, proceeding within knowledge transfer (spatial replication) or knowledge retention (temporal replication), respectively, our understanding of how replicating routines in new organizational units (knowledge transfer) affects an organization’s capacity to maintain adherence to those routines over time at existing units (knowledge retention) remains limited. Drawing on the organizational learning and related evolutionary economics literature on routines as well as the multiple goals literature and using data on a Fortune 100 franchise chain being scaled in the United States with thousands of outlets opened over a period of 10 years, we examine whether and how knowledge transfer affects knowledge retention. Our primary thesis is that knowledge transfer and knowledge retention create competing demands for limited attention and therefore the need to allocate attention between them. We posit that this gives rise to a negative relationship between the spatial (knowledge transfer) and temporal (knowledge retention) replication of routines, although the effect can be mitigated by organizational learning from experience. We find robust empirical support for our propositions, pointing to important attention and learning mechanisms that shape the organizational capacity to simultaneously navigate knowledge transfer and retention demands, that is, replicate routines across both space and time.Funding: This work was supported by Project PID2024-160548NB-I00 funded by MICIU/AEI /10.13039/501100011033 and by FEDER, EU as well as by by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/00124/2025, UID/PRR/124/2025, Nova School of Business and Economics] and LISBOA2030 [DataLab2030 - LISBOA2030-FEDER 01314200].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16528 .</content>

    <title>Roadmap or Compass? The Value of Prior Collaborative Experience in an Unfamiliar Task Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a temporary team faces an unfamiliar task environment, it should particularly benefit from including members who have collaborated before. Although several studies have made this prediction, it has not been supported empirically. We reconcile this discrepancy by distinguishing between prior collaborations in tightly versus loosely coupled roles, defined by the degree of interdependence among collaborators during prior work. Both forms of prior collaboration can help teammates communicate effectively, aiding team adaptation in new contexts. However, prior collaboration in tightly coupled roles also fosters shared routines that may create inertia and impede adaptation. As a result, we argue that the value of tightly coupled experience declines in unfamiliar environments, whereas the value of loosely coupled experience increases. We test these ideas using data from esports, where professional players with varying collaborative histories are randomly assigned to temporary teams. Unanticipated changes to the game exogenously alter teams’ familiarity with their task environments. Consistent with our theory, we find that tightly coupled collaborative experience enhances team performance in familiar task environments but degrades it in unfamiliar ones. Loosely coupled experience provides modest benefits in familiar environments but substantially enhances performance in unfamiliar ones. Overall, our findings suggest that when environments change, tightly coupled experience can act as a faulty roadmap—anchoring teams to outdated routines—whereas loosely coupled experience can serve as a compass that promotes coordination and adaptation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19399 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that long‐term institutional investors tilt their portfolios toward firms with better Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profiles, in the cross sections of both institutional investor portfolios and the ownership of firms. We test whether several theoretically motivated mechanisms can explain this relationship. Our results that long‐term investors exhibit patience with firms around poor earnings announcements, but quickly sell portfolio firms after negative ES incidents, support the view that long‐ and short‐term investors evaluate information differently. Our evidence shows that limits‐to‐arbitrage play a role, as we find that investors' ESG tilt weakens following regulatory shocks that shorten their horizon.</content>

    <title>The Assignment of Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the assignment of intellectual property rights between inventors and their employers affects innovation. Incomplete contracting theories predict that stronger employer property rights reduce the threat that employee inventors hold up their employers, thereby affecting inventor and invention outcomes. We test these predictions using a U.S. appellate court ruling that shifted the assignment of property rights from inventors to their employers. Within‐employer‐year analyses demonstrate that affected inventors are less likely to retain patent rights, assign patents to new employers, or leave their current employer, all consistent with reduced inventor ability to hold up their employers. Due to the reduced possibility of hold‐up, affected inventors’ innovations are revealed more promptly when disclosed, draw from a broader set of prior patents, and spread more to subsequent patents. If affected inventors do leave their employer, they are more likely to relocate to unaffected states. Furthermore, employers affected by the ruling are more likely to locate their inventors in agglomeration economies and alter their innovation strategy by reallocating activity across states and expanding their innovation portfolios. Our collective evidence suggests that shifting intellectual property rights to employers affects inventor and invention outcomes by reducing the threat of employee hold‐up from the employer's perspective.</content>

    <title>Unequal in the Spotlight: Gender Differences in How Serving on Prominent Firms Affects Directors’ New Board Appointments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does gaining a foothold in the upper echelons of the corporate landscape carry different implications for women and men? We address this question by examining gender differences in how serving on the boards of prominent firms leads to new board appointments. While prominent affiliations are widely recognized as advantageous, research has yet to ask whether these benefits vary by gender. Using data on the population of directors in the FTSE-100 between 2010 and 2017, we find that women are, on average, more likely than men to obtain additional board appointments, consistent with prior literature showing that pressures to increase diversity stimulate demand for incumbent women relative to men. However, serving on more-prominent boards within the FTSE-100 increases men’s likelihood of obtaining new appointments but decreases it for women. Thus, women’s advantage diminishes and eventually reverses, becoming a disadvantage, as firm prominence increases. Our systematic evaluation of potential demand- and supply-side explanations for this pattern finds limited support for both. We propose, instead, that women’s experiences of greater scrutiny and of informal demands on more-prominent boards may shape their willingness to pursue additional appointments. We highlight the dual role of prominent affiliations as sources of both opportunity and constraint, with implications for individual careers and organizational diversity.</content>

    <title>A Tale of Two Banks: When Credit Loss Models Meet Economic Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy makers and researchers are concerned that the expected credit loss (ECL) approach may exacerbate procyclicality. Using administrative loan‐level and firm‐level data in China, we find that banks adopting the ECL model reduced their credit supply and became more prudent in lending decisions after the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, compared to banks using the incurred credit loss (ICL) approach. Our findings are more pronounced for banks that experienced greater loan loss provisions induced by ECL and for firms with higher credit risk. The credit contraction persisted throughout our sample period. We further document that firms more exposed to ECL banks experienced larger reductions in loans, assets, liabilities, and revenue after the pandemic began than those more exposed to ICL banks. These findings support the conjecture that the ECL approach may exacerbate procyclicality.</content>
