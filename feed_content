    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We recover forward-looking expected net-of-fee abnormal returns (alphas) for active equity mutual funds from analyst ratings. In contrast to the typical equilibrium implication of zero alphas, analyst alphas are negative for most funds, but positive for the largest funds. We compare analysts’ subjective expectations with expectations from a rational expectations learning model. The model’s rational learner believes that an increase in fund size leads to a decrease in returns, but we find no evidence that analysts believe so. Consistently, counterfactual ratings based on the rational model tend to outperform analysts’ ratings out of sample. Investor fund flows respond significantly to analyst ratings.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Support from the Center for Big Data in Finance [Grant DNRF167], the Danish Finance Institute, and the Swedish House of Finance is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Can Employees’ Past Helping Behavior Be Used to Improve Shift Scheduling? Evidence from ICU Nurses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees routinely make valuable contributions at work that are not part of their formal job description, such as helping a struggling coworker. These contributions, termed organizational citizenship behavior, are studied from many angles in the organizational behavior literature. However, the degree to which the past helping behavior of employees scheduled to a shift impacts that shift’s operational outcomes remains an underexplored question. We define two measures of past helping behavior for members of a shift—the total past helping of each employee and the past helping between each pair of employees—and hypothesize that they are associated with shift performance. We empirically confirm our hypotheses with detailed scheduling and patient outcome data from six intensive care units (ICUs) at a large academic medical center, using the hospital’s electronic medical records to identify cases of one nurse helping another. Our empirical results indicate that both measures of past helping are predictive of patient length of stay (LOS), more so than the broadly studied notion of team familiarity. Counterfactual analysis shows that relatively small changes in shift composition can yield significant reduction in total LOS, indicating the managerial significance of the results. Overall, our study suggests the potential value of shift scheduling using data on past helping behaviors, and this may have promise far beyond the selected application to ICU nursing.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00465 .</content>

    <title>Inventing with Machines: Generative AI and the Evolving Landscape of IS Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not merely changing how information systems (IS) research gets done—it is reshaping what research can be. We stand at a pivotal moment where machines can help generate hypotheses, synthesize vast literatures, and identify patterns that would take human researchers months to uncover. Yet, this unprecedented capability presents equally unprecedented risks to scholarly integrity. Because the field is uniquely positioned to understand sociotechnical transformations, IS research faces an extraordinary opportunity to pioneer “inventing with machines” while preserving the human insight and oversight that gives scholarship, as currently defined, its meaning. This transformation demands more than tool adoption. It requires a reimagination of scholarly infrastructure, norms, and practice. However, this transformation of research tooling creates a dangerous paradox: Powerful AI tools are now accessible to researchers who lack the technical literacy to understand and use them responsibly, threatening everything from citation accuracy to theoretical validity. Yet within this paradox lies the potential for revolutionary advances in how we craft our future as scholars. Informed by the sociotechnical perspective, we argue that the path forward requires coordinated community action that goes far beyond individual skill development. The IS community must lead the development of specialized AI tools that consider our theoretical traditions, create educational frameworks that preserve scholarly values while embracing computational capabilities, and pioneer review processes that harness AI’s analytical power without ceding human control, at least, in the short run. Success will determine not only the future of IS scholarship but our field’s capacity to guide other disciplines through this fundamental transformation of academic practice. The era of human-AI collaboration in research has already begun. How we govern and guide it will define the next generation of scholarly discovery.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence, CEO Turnover, and Exploration Orientation in Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leadership transitions often create uncertainty in corporate innovation. Our study shows that artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in helping firms navigate these transitions. Using data on patents, job postings, and CEO turnover across U.S. public firms, we find that organizations with stronger AI investment are more successful in pursuing explorative innovation after CEO turnover. AI enables this shift by helping leaders overcome two common barriers: managerial myopia, the tendency to rely on familiar past practices, and information overload, which can overwhelm new executives. Firms that leverage AI more effectively reallocate resources to research and development, elevate innovation as a strategic priority, and launch new initiatives. These effects are especially pronounced in manufacturing industries and when CEOs have science, technology, engineering, and mathematics backgrounds. For practice, our findings highlight AI as a strategic capability that helps firms sustain organizational creativity during leadership change. For policy, they suggest that promoting AI adoption could strengthen innovation dynamism and competitiveness in rapidly changing environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The aging workforce demands evidence‐based human resource practices that lengthen working lives. Building on the Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll 1989), we investigate which organizational practices are indispensable for expanding older workers' occupational future time perspective (OFTP)—people's perceived opportunities and remaining time at work (Zacher and Frese 2009). A necessary condition analysis of survey data from 3077 workers aged 50+ in nine countries tests nine domains of the Later Life Workplace Index (LLWI) as potentialminimal viable practices. All domains exhibited statistically significant necessity effects; however, using the conventional threshold (Dul et al. 2023), only later life supportive leadership and adaptive work design reached the level consideredmeaningfully necessary. The remaining domains showed smaller, near necessity effects, suggesting a pattern of partial necessity across HRM practices. Exploratory analyses along the Tightness–Looseness cultural continuum suggested that necessity thresholds tended to be higher in culturally Tight than Loose societies, highlighting the importance of context‐sensitive HRM. This study refines theorizing on career sustainability, introduces necessity logic to the work and aging literature, and offers managers evidence‐based tools to prevent insurmountable shortcomings. Failure to meet the identified LLWI thresholds will typically result in suboptimal OFTP.</content>

    <title>Ch‐Ch‐Ch‐Ch‐Changes: The Impact of Supply Base Growth, Contraction, and Turnover on Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern supply chains are experiencing more disturbances due to regulatory shifts, rising sustainability standards, emerging or declining markets, and disruption to critical inputs. Some firms react by strengthening existing supplier partnerships to resist changes, while others reconfigure relationships with suppliers to embrace changes. Implicitly assuming structural changes are generally undesirable, research has traditionally supported the former approach to resist structural changes. However, the literature is not conclusive about the validity of this assumption. This study examines how supply base changes, captured as growth, contraction, and turnover, create opportunities and challenges for firm innovation. The results suggest that supply base growth positively impacts innovation performance, while supply base contraction has no significant statistical association. Supply base turnover has a nonlinear effect: it initially boosts innovation performance but negatively impacts it at high levels. This study contributes to theory by highlighting how supply base instability can bring innovation opportunities and risks to a firm. Specifically, supply base instability is broken down into distinct aspects, which are shown to affect firm innovation in distinctive manners. The findings not only urge supply managers to embrace supply base changes as an opportunity conducive to firm innovation but also caution against the disruptiveness of excessive changes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of a Horizontal Versus Vertical Product Display on the Attraction Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers can display their products horizontally or vertically in both online and offline settings. This display orientation has been shown to influence consumers’ judgments about individual products. The present research extends the literature by investigating the moderating impact of display orientation on the attraction effect, one of the most well-established context effects in choice. A total of eleven studies, including seven pre-registered experiments, document a novel finding that the attraction effect is stronger when choice alternatives are displayed horizontally rather than vertically. This moderating influence is replicated in both consequential choices and hypothetical scenarios and shown to generalize over diverse product categories. We explain this influence by proposing that a horizontal (vs. vertical) display increases the ease of comparing choice alternatives, leading consumers to notice the asymmetric dominance (AD) relationship among them more easily. Consistent with this mechanism, we find that the moderating influence of display orientation attenuates when individuals are guided to recognize the AD relationship or when their ability to compare vertically displayed products is momentarily enhanced. The present research thus demonstrates a significant effect of spatial orientation on the comparison and evaluation of alternatives. Theoretical and managerial implications of findings are discussed.</content>

    <title>Anthropomorphizing personal goals as dependent persons empowers consumer goal pursuit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Psychological empowerment plays a crucial role in motivating individuals to pursue their goals. This research explores a unique method to empower consumers in their goal pursuit: anthropomorphizing goals as dependent persons in need of care. Through three studies, including an incentive‐compatible study and a field study conducted at a hypermarket, we demonstrate that viewing personal goals as dependent persons who require care and nurturance (e.g., presenting a goal as a dependent person in a health app) can significantly enhance goal pursuit (e.g., choosing healthy snacks) by boosting psychological empowerment. We find that this motivational boost does not occur when a goal is simply anthropomorphized as any person (Study 1), when it is depicted as a dependent object (Study 1), or when it is anthropomorphized as an independent person (Study 2). This research contributes to a deeper understanding of motivation in goal pursuit and offers practical implications for marketers. Specifically, by using marketing communications to frame goals as entities that require care, marketers can help individuals foster a more engaging and empowering relationship with their aspirations.</content>

    <title>To wait, or not to wait: The paradoxical effects of time metaphors on impatience</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research explores the paradoxical effects of two different root metaphors of time—as resource and as motion—on impatience. We first show a conceptual correspondence between the two root metaphors: experiences associated with little time are often perceived as similar to those associated with time passing quickly, and experiences associated with ample time are often perceived as similar to those associated with time passing slowly. However, people's impatience exhibits opposite patterns for the corresponding metaphors: while people are less willing to wait when they have little versus ample time, they are more willing to wait when they experience time passing quickly versus slowly. This paradoxical effect arises because corresponding metaphors have opposite effects on perceived control and anticipated valence of the waiting time, which in turn lead to variations in impatience. Four studies (plus two in the Appendices S4 and S5) conducted across online, lab, and field settings support these findings. By identifying the relationship between the root metaphors of time‐as‐motion and time‐as‐resource and their paradoxical effects on impatience, this research contributes to the literatures on temporal cognition and intertemporal choice, and to the broader literature on the role of metaphors in consumer decision‐making.</content>

    <title>Trading with the enemy: A coopetitive perspective of resource exchange at arm's length</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on inter‐firm cooperation often focuses on long‐term strategic alliances while overlooking the distinct form of arm's‐length resource exchanges. Our study addresses this gap using the National Basketball Association (NBA) data for precise resource exchange measurements. Contrary to strategic alliances, where competitive pressure fosters cooperation, we find that competitive pressure reduces cooperation in arm's‐length exchanges. However, relational capital helps to facilitate resource exchanges. We also found that while resource bundling exacerbates the negative effect of competitive pressure, it amplifies the positive effect of relational capital. Interestingly, relational rivalry intensifies the impact of competitive pressure but does not diminish the effect of relational capital. These insights have important implications for the coopetition and the Strategic Factor Markets (SFM) literature.Managerial SummaryIn competitive environments, organizations may cooperate to reduce competition, often through long‐term strategic alliances. However, our research reveals different behaviors in arm's‐length resource exchanges. Analyzing NBA player transaction data, we found that competition generally discourages resource exchanges due to opportunism concerns, particularly when multiple resources are involved. Interestingly, organizations are more likely to engage in arm's‐length exchanges when key members have prior cooperative histories, especially in complex scenarios. Historical rivalries also heighten the competitive impact on resource exchanges but do not significantly diminish the benefits of prior cooperation. This study offers valuable insights for managers, helping them navigate resource exchange dynamics among competitors and make more informed strategic decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm births are key drivers of employment growth, productivity gains, and “creative destruction.” We show that setup costs create sizable financial constraints for new firms. When firms face high setup costs, they can only be established by leveraging up and lengthening debt maturity. We empirically confirm these predictions in a large sample of young French firms. Leverage is higher and debt maturity is longer in industries with high setup costs. Last, we show that following an exogenous shock that reduces banks’ supply of long-term loans, there is relatively lower firm creation in manufacturing industries with high setup costs.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Observatoire du financement des entreprises par le marché (OFEM) (NA) and Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grant F-STAR ANR-17-CE26-0007-01].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03846 .</content>

    <title>Assortment Optimization with α-Similar Substitutes: Insights from Customer Browsing Patterns</title>
    <updated>2025-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach to model assortment optimization problems based on two observations we made from customer browsing history on Taobao. First, most customers consider very few items (no more than five) before purchasing. Second, there exists a sorting of items so that most customer consideration sets are contained in small intervals in this sorting. This sorting can be discovered by the Cuthill-McKee algorithm, which is designed to work with sparse matrices. We encode these two observations into the [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property, which requires that all customers have consideration sets that lie in intervals (in the sorting) of length at most [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is a parameter we select and is fitted from data. The assortment optimization and pricing problems associated with this property are fixed-parameter tractable for a fixed [Formula: see text]. Moreover, we show that the assortment optimization for some specific choice model with [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property is polynomial-time solvable. We demonstrate our approach—going from data to modeling (i.e., selecting an appropriate [Formula: see text]) and finally to optimization—on another data set of customer click history on JD.com. Lastly, we conduct sensitivity tests on choice models that satisfy the [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property in the presence of customers with large consideration sets. We provide an approximation guarantee in terms of revenue when asserting the [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property. Both theoretical and numerical results show that the optimal assortment of our estimated model captures most of the revenue even when there are customers with large consideration sets.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Funding: B.

    <title>Electric Vehicle Fleet and Charging Infrastructure Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study electric vehicle (EV) fleet and charging infrastructure planning in a spatial setting. For a centrally managed fleet that serves customer requests arriving continuously at a rate [Formula: see text] throughout the day, we determine the minimum number of vehicles and chargers for a target service level along with matching and charging policies. Whereas non-EV systems require extra [Formula: see text] vehicles because of pickup times, EV systems differ. Charging increases nominal capacity, enabling pickup time reductions and allowing for an extra fleet requirement of only [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text], depending on charging infrastructure and battery pack sizes. We propose the power-of-d dispatching policy, which achieves this performance by selecting the closest vehicle with the highest battery level from d options. We extend our results to accommodate time-varying demand patterns and discuss conditions for transitioning between EV and non-EV capacity planning. Simulations verify our scaling results, insights, and policy effectiveness. Whereas long-range, fast-charging fleets resemble non-EV systems, short-range, low-cost fleets can still perform competitively, underscoring the need for EV-aware management policies.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08524 .</content>

    <title>Homelessness‐based impact hiring and consumers' contagion concerns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial company actions typically create favorable product evaluations. However, an emerging practice whereby companies employ individuals experiencing homelessness (i.e., “homelessness‐based impact hiring [IH]”) represents a meaningful exception. Five experiments show that consumers hold unfavorable perceptions of products from companies implementing homelessness‐based IH, despite moderately favorable moral judgments of the company, due to an unfavorable emotional response (i.e., disgust) activated by stigma‐driven contagion concerns. Experiment 1 demonstrates this phenomenon using actual choice behavior. Experiment 2 shows that the effect is specific to homelessness (vs. stigmatized groups in general) and is mediated by disgust. Experiment 3 replicates these effects using a non‐food product where contagion is relevant, while showing the effect attenuates when contagion is less relevant. Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrate how social proof may enhance the favorability of consumer response by targeting contagion concerns and therefore reducing disgust. Findings suggest that, despite consumer moral support, marketers cannot rely on halo effects from this emerging practice, while also providing theory‐driven guidance on overcoming obstacles to its implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Working remotely during the pandemic reshaped workplace culture. Many employers face pushback when implementing return‐to‐office (RTO) policies, primarily because the beliefs and expectations of employers and employees differ. This paper reviews the effects of RTO policies on various outcomes, including employee productivity, voluntary turnover, corporate culture, psychological safety, workplace civility, mental health and well‐being, and burnout incidence. Drawing on theory and research in these areas, it then proposes 10 best practices to support RTO transitions, such as framing the conversation, repairing the psychological contract, and developing RTO and communication strategies. To facilitate further improvements, the paper concludes with a framework comprising six focal areas related to RTO transitions, along with specific questions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between the gender composition of audit teams and two important audit outcomes—audit quality and audit fees. We identify gender composition across auditor ranks with novel audit-office level data for 20 large U.S. public accounting firms from 2010 to 2018. We find engagements of audit offices with more female auditors are associated with higher audit quality and lower audit fees. We find the association between gender composition and audit outcomes is strongest at the staff level, and among audit seniors in particular. The results also strengthen in offices with more supportive workplace environments. Overall, our large-scale evidence provides important insights on the role of gender composition of audit teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines the role of reward systems in enhancing cooperation, particularly when individual contributions are not fully transparent. We investigate the impact of reward mechanisms on cooperative behavior using an experimental setup known as the Voluntary Contribution Mechanism with Rewards. Our experimental design compares centralized reward (CR) systems, where an authority distributes rewards, with decentralized reward (DR) systems, where peers allocate rewards, against a no-reward baseline. The results reveal that CR generally promotes the highest level of cooperation, whereas DR achieves the greatest economic efficiency across all test environments. Participants also exhibited a strong preference for CR. These findings contribute to the existing literature by highlighting the effectiveness of reward systems in mitigating social dilemmas under conditions of imperfect information. The study offers vital insights for policymakers and organizational members in selecting incentive mechanisms that foster sustained collective action, even when individual efforts are not directly observable.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72503075 and 72203132]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [Grants 20AZD044, 22&amp;ZD150, and 24&amp;ZD084]; the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [Grants ZR2023QG096, ZR2023QG071, ZR2022MG068, and ZR2022QG048]; the Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province [Grant tsqn201909013 and tsqn202408212]; and the Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of Shandong University [Grant 21RWZD15] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06479 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We uncover a new price pattern: The stock systematic component exhibits momentum. This systematic momentum further yields a return momentum: Stocks sorted by systematic component have persistent positive returns. In comparison with the extremely popular and extensively studied momentum sorted by return, which is valid only monthly, our systematic return momentum holds intraday, daily, weekly, and monthly. Furthermore, our systematic momentum, the strongest ever discovered, is different from the factor momentum sorted by factor performance.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: S. Z.

    <title>Can Social Media Inform Corporate Decisions? Evidence from Merger Withdrawals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether social media sentiment predicts merger withdrawals. We find that a one‐standard‐deviation increase in social media sentiment after a merger announcement is associated with a 0.64 percentage point lower probability of withdrawal (16.6% of the average). This effect is unexplained by abnormal price reactions, traditional news, and analyst recommendations. Consistent with manager learning, the informativeness of social media strengthens after firms start corporate Twitter accounts. The informativeness is driven by longer acquisition‐related tweets by fundamental investors, rather than memes and price trend tweets. These findings suggest that social media signals can be important for corporate decisions.</content>

    <title>How Perceptual Disfluency Affects Consumer Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketing materials often create difficulties for consumers through elements like unconventional fonts or distracting background images, leading to perceptual disfluency—a sense of difficulty encoding information. During choices, consumers can mistake perceptual disfluency for choice difficulty, a feeling of indecision. Building on this idea, eleven preregistered experiments (N = 9,042) show that, when making choices, perceptual disfluency can lead consumers to rely on information that feels more intuitively appealing to them, such as a familiar brand, a preferred country of origin, or a recommendation, rather than on information they must carefully consider like numerical product specifications. Differing from the effect of perceptual disfluency in other situations, during choices, this effect occurs because consumers process information less deeply, engaging in relatively more intuitive and less analytical processing. This effect is amplified when consumers endorse a “fast-is-accurate” lay theory. In contrast, it does not occur when consumers do not mistake perceptual disfluency for choice difficulty, as when prompted to consider the actual reason for the disfluency, or when not making a choice.</content>

    <title>Extremeness Aversion and Choice Set Composition: Exposure to Multiple Extreme Options Reduces Extremeness Aversion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extremeness aversion—the tendency for consumers to prefer middling options in a choice set—is an incredibly robust and well-studied phenomenon. However, it has primarily been studied in the context of two or three option choice sets. In six studies (Ntotal = 9,377), we suggest consumers’ aversion to extreme options depends on the frequency of similar options in the choice set. In particular, we find that consumers are relatively more likely to choose an option that is in an extreme relative position when they are exposed to multiple extreme options, an effect not predicted by standard theories of context-dependent choice. This occurs because consumers perceive objectively extreme (vs. intermediate) options as relatively more typical of the product category. We demonstrate this effect is robust across different types of compositions, hypothetical and incentive-compatible studies, and in a variety of decision contexts (e.g., purchasing an item vs. choosing an activity to complete). Further, we identify boundary conditions, such as the type of occasion consumers are choosing for.</content>

    <title>The (Better) Road Not Taken: Setting a Goal Reduces Switching to More Effective Alternatives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;AbstractWe identify a novel way in which setting goals can backfire. In 13 studies and four supplemental studies, using both incentive-compatible and hypothetical designs across a range of domains, we demonstrate that setting an explicit goal and making progress towards it decreases the likelihood of switching to alternative means of pursuit. This occurs because means seem more effective relative to alternatives if they have been used to progress toward a reference point. Consistent with this mechanism, we show that the perceived effectiveness of the means used to pursue a goal, relative to an alternative, partially mediates the effect of setting a goal on the decision to switch means. Further, the effect occurs only after people make initial progress towards a specified reference point. Setting a goal does not decrease switching if people are reminded to consider the advantages of both the initial and alternative means. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.</content>

    <title>Pollution havens versus gates of hell: Environmental pollution and multinationals' foreign investment</title>
    <updated>2025-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates an under‐explored cost of operating in pollution havens: thepollution‐induced operational cost, or the increased labor costs and material supply constraints resulting from host countries' environmental pollution. Environmental degradation can thus turn “pollution havens,” where lax compliance beckons institutional arbitrage and attracts investments from foreign firms, into “gates of hell,” where ecological damage heightens the costs for business operations and discourages foreign investments. We find evidence in a panel of US multinational corporations from 2007 to 2020. A firm's investment in a host country is decreasing in the host country's environmental pollution, especially if the firm faces heightened constraints in finding alternative labor inputs and material supplies or is highly dependent on these resources.Managerial SummaryOur findings offer practical insights for multinational corporate managers and policymakers. First, managers need to evaluate the opportunity of arbitrage against the cost of operation associated with environmental pollution, especially considering their firm's labor and material supply constraints. Second, policymakers should consider the price of relaxing environmental regulations to attract foreign investments. While weak environmental policies may spur investment from arbitraging firms into a (developing) country, unregulated destruction of the natural environment will inflict inevitable operational costs to destroy broader business opportunities, as the crucial resources (e.g., labor inputs and material supplies) become degraded by pollution.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Principal Reduction on Household Distress: Evidence from Mortgage Cramdown</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mortgage cramdown enabled bankruptcy judges to discharge the underwater portion of a mortgage in a chapter 13 bankruptcy until the Supreme Court disallowed this practice in 1993. We investigate the impact of mortgage cramdown on household distress exploiting the random assignment of cases to judges. The impact of bankruptcy protection on foreclosures is reduced by more than half after the Supreme Court disallowed cramdown. Our results suggest that large principal reductions considerably decrease homeowners’ distress by reducing debt overhang. (JEL D14, G21, G51, K35)</content>

    <title>Bank Debt, Mutual Fund Equity, and Swing Pricing in Liquidity Provision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Liquidity provision is often attributed to debt-issuing intermediaries like banks. We develop a unified theoretical framework and empirically show that mutual funds issuing demandable equity also provide an economically significant amount of liquidity by insuring against idiosyncratic liq uidity shocks. Quantitatively, bond funds provide 12.5% of the liquidity that banks provide per dollar. Our model further shows that when equity values incorporate the liquidation cost from re demptions, as in swing pricing, liquidity provision is not necessarily reduced. This is because swing pricing may increase funds’ capacity for holding illiquid assets without inducing panic runs. (JEL G01, G21, G23, G28)</content>

    <title>Designing Inclusive Offerings</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The trend toward inclusivity in product and service design—ensuring equal access to, or benefit from, products and services—has gained significant attention in industries such as beauty, wellness, and fashion. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no rigorous definition of inclusivity in the product line design or assortment optimization literature. This paper addresses the need for rigorous models, frameworks, and methods to create inclusive product lines and to measure the inclusivity of existing ones. We introduce the first formal definition of inclusive offerings and propose two continuous measures of inclusivity. We then formulate the inclusive offering design problem, which aims to select a minimum-cardinality set of offerings from a continuous feature space to ensure suitability for all users. Despite its NP-hardness, we present an optimal algorithm for realistic settings and one-dimensional feature spaces. Additionally, we explore the inclusivity resulting from offerings designed to maximize profit, revealing a nonmonotone relationship between inclusivity and the diversity of the user population. Our methods and metrics are applied to the foundation lines of eleven leading makeup brands, demonstrating their practical relevance and impact to the inclusive beauty movement.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, management science.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06742 .</content>

    <title>Redesigning VolunteerMatch’s Search Algorithm: Toward More Equitable Access to Volunteers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In collaboration with VolunteerMatch (VM)—the world’s largest online platform for connecting volunteers with volunteering opportunities—we designed and implemented a new display ranking algorithm. VM’s original ranking algorithm was intended to maximize efficiency (i.e., the total number of connections), but as a consequence, it repeatedly displayed the same few opportunities at the top of its ranking, effectively limiting access to volunteers for the other opportunities. To incorporate VM’s desire for equity (defined as the weekly number of opportunities with at least one connection) along with efficiency, we propose a modeling framework for online display ranking in settings where it is important to manage the trade-off between the total number of connections and the equitable allocation of these connections. We take an adversarial approach in evaluating the performance of online algorithms and show that a class of algorithms that applies a penalty to opportunities after each connection provides a strong (and, in certain regimes, optimal) performance guarantee. Inspired by our theoretical results yet mindful of practical considerations on VM’s platform, we propose SmartSort, a simple score-based ranking algorithm that enjoys comparable guarantees in many regimes. We implemented SmartSort in two experiments, covering Dallas–Fort Worth and all of Southern California. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the implementation of SmartSort led to an estimated 8% increase in the weekly average number of opportunities with at least one connection (consistent across both experiments) without any significant decrease in the total number of connections. If SmartSort has a similar distributional effect on a national scale, an additional 30,000 connections every year will go to opportunities that would have otherwise lacked access to volunteers.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03838 .</content>

    <title>Entrepreneurial Market Leadership Claims, Cultural Resonance, and Investor Evaluations in Nascent Markets: The Goldilocks Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cultural entrepreneurship research emphasizes entrepreneurs’ use of cultural resources to influence audience evaluations through resonance. However, the process by which such cultural resonance is achieved remains underexplored, particularly as an intermediary outcome. We investigate how cultural resonance may be attained by focusing on entrepreneurs’ use of a prevalent cultural resource in nascent markets: market leadership claims. Incorporating insights from social psychological research, we propose that the frequency of these claims becomes an important prompt in triggering investors’ cognitive processing and affects the attainment of cultural resonance. Specifically, we theorize a ‘Goldilocks effect’: a venture’s increased claiming frequency initially enhances resonance with investors, resulting in more favourable evaluations, but excessive claims reduce it, resulting in less favourable evaluations. Using a multimethod approach comprising an archival study and an experiment, we find support for our theory. These findings offer new insights into research on cultural entrepreneurship, discursive strategy, and nascent market strategies.</content>

    <title>Firm growth and stagnation in the United States: Key trends and new data opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using administrative data from the US Census Bureau, we introduce a new public‐use dataset (“Business Dynamics Statistics—High Growth” [BDS‐HG]) that captures the full distribution of firm growth in the United States between 1978 and 2021. BDS‐HG enables researchers to analyze not only high‐growth firms but also stagnant and shrinking firms, disaggregated by firm maturity, size, industry, region, and year. We begin by documenting two key trends: (1) a significant decline in the share of high‐growth firms—especially among young and small firms and (2) a marked rise in stagnant firms. To help illustrate the dataset's usefulness, we provide three empirical applications and highlight research opportunities across major areas of strategic management. In addition to supporting new analyses, BDS‐HG can be used to benchmark research samples and assess their generalizability.Managerial SummaryThe US economy has seen two major shifts in firm growth dynamics: a steady decline in the share of high‐growth firms—especially among startups—and a notable rise in firms that exhibit no growth. We document these patterns using BDS‐HG, a new public‐use dataset from the US Census Bureau that tracks employment growth across all US employer businesses from 1978 to 2021. The data are disaggregated by firm age, size, industry, geography, and year, enabling users to examine growth trends across sectors and regions. BDS‐HG offers a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and analysts seeking to understand long‐term business dynamism. It can also be used to benchmark research samples against national patterns, helping users assess how representative their data or findings are.</content>

    <title>All Along the Watchtower: Military Landholders and Serfdom Consolidation in Early Modern Russia</title>
    <updated>2025-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines the emergence of coercive labour institutions using the case of serfdom in early modern Russia. We argue that serfdom consolidated under the pressure of landholding military elites who gained political influence due to the prolonged struggle with steppe nomads. To contain nomadic raids, the Russian state erected defence lines on the southern frontier, and granted land in the area to soldiers in charge of its defence. The soldiers could not farm while on defence duty, nor could they compete in the market for peasant labour, as the land had been selected for its defensive rather than agricultural value. The system was therefore only sustainable by restricting labour mobility. In response to the volume of landholders’ collective petitions, the Russian state gradually tied peasants to the land and institutionalized serfdom in the written law. Using newly digitized population data from the 17th century, we show a higher prevalence of serfs and military landholders in districts on the defence line. We also find a higher prevalence of small estates—up to 25 serf households—sufficient to support a soldier and his family. Placebo tests show that these patterns do not hold for non-serf peasants, or for merchants and artisans. To ensure causality, we develop a novel algorithm that reconstructs the optimal invasion routes for nomads and pinpoints the optimal location of the defence line using topographic data. Our results highlight the primacy of political economy factors over purely economic ones, such as the land–labour ratio or the grain trade, in the development of serfdom. This sheds new light on the possible mechanisms of institutional divergence between Eastern and Western Europe in the early modern period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do startups influence the neighborhoods in which they locate? Using data from the Greater London area, we find a positive association between growth-oriented entrepreneurship and both demographic and organizational changes in these communities. Older, less educated residents are replaced by younger, more educated ones. Restaurants become more expensive and more diverse. We also demonstrate that growth-oriented entrepreneurship predicts a subsequent rise in residential real estate prices. This price appreciation, however, does not seem to benefit long-term residents, as property values increase primarily in areas with high rates of renting. The gentrification of neighborhoods experiencing startup entry calls for deeper reflection on the role of entrepreneurship in inequality and the sustainability of entrepreneurial ecosystems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18920 .</content>

    <title>On the Convergence of Modified Policy Iteration in Risk-Sensitive Exponential Cost Markov Decision Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Balancing Risk and Robustness in Dynamic Decision MakingMany real systems, such as networks, finance, and safety-critical autonomy, must hedge against rare but costly events. Risk-sensitive control formalizes this idea by optimizing an exponential cost objective that prioritizes reliability over just average performance. Classical dynamic programming methods such as value iteration and policy iteration are well-understood in this risk-sensitive setting. However, modified policy iteration (MPI), which combines the strengths of both through partial policy evaluation, has lacked any theoretical understanding. This paper addresses this gap. It analyzes MPI for risk-sensitive Markov decision processes governed by a multiplicative Bellman equation, develops normalization and contraction tools suited to this setting, and proves both convergence and finite-time guarantees. The results provide a principled foundation for algorithms that combine computational efficiency with robustness, supporting the development of reinforcement learning methods that emphasize long-term reliability.</content>

    <title>Proactive Policing: Resource Allocation for Crime Prevention with Deterrence Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing Police Presence to Prevent Crime Before It HappensIn their paper “Proactive Policing: Resource Allocation for Crime Prevention with Deterrence Effect,” He, Li, and Zhao introduce a novel optimization framework that reimagines how police resources should be allocated to prevent crimes rather than react to them. Departing from traditional models that respond after incidents occur, the authors propose a proactive approach grounded in the economics of deterrence effect and rational choice theory. By modeling offenders’ location choices using a multinomial logit framework, the study captures how visible police presence not only suppresses crime locally but also redistributes potential criminal activity across space, a phenomenon known as crime displacement and diffusion of crime control. The authors establish the computational complexity of the problem, develop tractable mixed-integer conic reformulations, and extend the framework to dynamic settings. A data-driven case study in New York City demonstrates the model’s potential to guide smarter, prevention-focused deployment of urban policing resources.</content>

    <title>Political Polarization and Nonmarket Strategy over the Policy Life Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Growing political polarization has reshaped the business landscape, shifting the mix of private and public politics companies face and requiring managers to develop more sophisticated nonmarket strategies. Yet the literature has largely continued to study strategies aimed at public and private politics in isolation. We analyze repertoires of nonmarket strategies and how they evolve over time in a formal game theoretic model of the policy life cycle, providing an integrated framework for studying public and private politics. Industry may resist activist campaigns or concede to them and may also lobby to block legislation when public politics is viable. The evolution of public opinion in a polarized world divides the game into two distinct phases, an initial phase of pure private politics and a subsequent phase with both public and private politics. Polarization delays social consensus and intensifies activism while increasing industry resistance to it. As public concern about an issue rises over time, industry resistance to activist campaigns weakens, and lobbying becomes costlier and less likely. We reveal important complementarities between strategies: The ability to lobby in the latter phase makes industry more resistant to activist campaigns during both phases of the life cycle. Our analysis demonstrates clearly and precisely how suboptimal strategic decisions may result from a failure to fully coordinate nonmarket strategy instruments.This paper was accepted by Anita McGahan, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.00819 .</content>

    <title>Augmented Learning for Joint Creativity in Human-GenAI Co-Creation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has opened new opportunities for human–GenAI co-creation, in which humans and GenAI collaborate to produce creative outcomes. However, our findings indicate that mere integration does not guarantee augmented learning—the foundation for the continuous improvement of joint creativity over time. Effective integration depends on how well humans understand and collaborate with GenAI. We propose a two-step approach. First, organizations should critically assess GenAI’s strengths and limitations, recognizing its capacity to analyze data and generate diverse ideas, but also its lack of contextual and emotional understanding. Second, organizations should design targeted strategies and training programs that cultivate employees’ skills in Idea Co-Development—a co-creation activity in which humans and GenAI engage in critical feedback exchanges and the joint refinement of generated ideas. Our study demonstrates that even basic explanations and examples of Idea Co-Development significantly enhance joint creativity, suggesting that formal training with contextualized exercises can further amplify results. From a policy and design perspective, GenAI developers should build systems that actively support co-creative interaction through features such as feedback loops and prompts for elaboration. Together, these organizational and technological initiatives can foster more effective, sustained, and creative human-GenAI collaboration.</content>

    <title>Firm Quality Dynamics and the Slippery Slope of Credit Intervention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A salient trend in crisis intervention has emerged in recent decades: government and central banks have offered funding directly to nonfinancial firms, bypassing banks and other credit intermediaries. We analyze the long-term consequences of such policies by focusing on firm quality dynamics. In a laissez-faire economy, firms with high productivity are more likely to survive crises than those with low productivity. The government funding support saves more firms but cannot be customized based on firm productivity, dampening the cleansing effect of crises. The policy distortion is self-perpetuating: a downward bias in the firm quality distribution necessitates larger interventions in future crises. Our mechanism is quantitatively important: we show that if policymakers ignore such distortionary effects on firm quality dynamics, the resultant credit intervention would almost double the optimal amount.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial performance is often right-skewed and heavy-tailed, yet empirical studies typically focus on average outcomes, assuming normality. Recent research addresses this by examining full performance distributions. We extend this work by introducing an intuitive framework with three distinct characteristics of distributional tails: (a) tail impact, the contribution of star performers relative to the rest; (b) tail extremity, the extent by which the highest performer exceeds the typical performer; and (c) tail frequency, the fraction of performers who are stars. We outline a methodological guide, offer illustrative examples, and provide R code to enrich future investigations of star performance in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We trace the evolution of the language of science, religion, and political economy in the centuries leading to the British Industrial Revolution. Using textual analysis of 264,443 works printed in England between 1500 and 1900, we test whether British culture manifested a belief in progress associated with science and industry. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, there was a separation in the languages of science and religion beginning in the mid-18th century. Second, volumes using language at the nexus of science and political economy became more progress-oriented during the Enlightenment. Third, volumes using industrial language—especially those at the science-political economy nexus—were more progress-oriented beginning in the 18th century.</content>

    <title>Recalibrating Entrepreneurship Research: Decolonizing and Embracing the Pluralism of Entrepreneurial Activity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship research has long focused on exceptional, high‐growth, venture‐funded firms while overlooking the everyday and modest ventures that make up most entrepreneurial activity. This Special Issue calls for a recalibration of the field by decolonizing its assumptions and embracing its pluralism. We distinguish between conventional entrepreneurship, shaped by ideals of technology‐driven innovation and venture‐capital funded growth, and unconventional entrepreneurship, which reflects diverse and contextually grounded practices. Focusing on everydayness, pluralism, and decolonization, we draw on Santos’ concept of abyssal line to invite a shift from studying outliers to studying the ordinary. Using the metaphor of moving from a microscope to a prism, we call for theories that capture the full spectrum of entrepreneurial life across contexts and cultures. We discuss how papers in this Special Issue exemplify this prism approach and, in doing so, cast new light on how entrepreneurship can be understood, studied, and imagined.</content>

    <title>Chatting Towards Inclusivity: A Digital Approach to Inclusion Action Plans and Leader Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inclusion is a cornerstone of success for organizations and society, yet inclusion is not guaranteed. Building on inclusive leadership research and relational models theory, we argue that inclusion cannot manifest without systematic effort and planning by leaders. Unfortunately, few resources exist to help leaders plan and enact specific inclusion behaviors. To address this, we introduce the “Leader Success Bot,” an innovative conversational chatbot designed to help leaders develop daily inclusion action plans. Through our immersive longitudinal design and mixed methods data, we advance the taxonomy of inclusive leader behaviors and test the impact of inclusion planning on leaders and followers. We demonstrate how equality matching is an overlooked relational model that is a pivotal relational dynamic for inclusion. Across two studies, our quantitative and qualitative findings show that equitable exchanges by leaders can foster a deeper sense of belonging and community. As leaders interact with the chatbot, both leaders and followers are more likely to accomplish their goals. Additionally, followers' inclusion climate and psychological safety benefited, leading to a decrease in turnover intentions. Our findings underscore the potential of chatbots to support inclusive leadership training and development by providing leaders with a structured, scalable platform for continuous reflection and growth. This research advances theoretical understanding of relational inclusion dynamics and offers practical insights and a scalable tool for HR managers seeking to build more inclusive, psychologically safe cultures.</content>

    <title>Location choice in global patent litigation: Does the landscape matter?</title>
    <updated>2025-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms asserting their patents globally face a dilemma: a legal verdict is binding only in the country of litigation, and yet litigating country by country is prohibitively expensive. Thus, firms have to be strategic in deciding where to sue. In this paper, we argue that global patent litigation is not only about winning a case, but also about making a case, that is, leveraging litigation in one country to shape expectations on litigation outcomes elsewhere. Our analyses on patent litigation in 50 countries over 13 years show that firms tend to concentrate litigation in few countries when the relevant markets historically share similar litigation outcomes, so litigation in one country can effectively inform the litigants of future trajectories, reducing the need for repetitive litigation across countries.Managerial SummaryWhile legal enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights remains national, the battleground for IP has become increasingly global, especially for firms competing across countries. In this paper, we argue that the location choice for global patent litigation depends not only on country characteristics, such as market size and competition intensity, but also on the relationships across countries, that is, how similar or different the IP regimes are. When the relevant countries historically share similar litigation outcomes, firms can use litigation in one country to influence the expectations of litigants and potential infringers in other markets, which reduces the need for repetitive litigation. Thus, examining the global landscape of patent litigation as a whole can provide insight beyond the sum of IP strategies in individual countries.</content>

    <title>The Support Paradox: Explaining (Mis)Matches in Refugee Workplace Support</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent refugee movements have spurred corporate initiatives, with workplace support proving critical for integration. However, while research on workplace support for refugees remains limited, the broader support literature highlights paradoxical effects – support either benefits or harms recipients depending on how well it matches their needs. This study investigates how and why (mis)matches occur between support practices and refugees’ needs. Adopting a multiperspective qualitative approach, we conducted 53 in‐depth interviews with refugee employees and their support providers (e.g., supervisors and human resource managers), spanning 25 support relationships and 19 companies. Our analysis reveals three distinct support constellations: work‐centric, caring vs. intrusive, and self‐help. Each constellation represents a recurring configuration of how support is understood, delivered, and experienced. The convergent and divergent perspectives of recipients and providers on agency, perceived challenges, and appropriate forms of support shape these constellations. We theorize three underlying mechanisms – framing and perception, communication, and reflexivity – that explain why differing perspectives exist and how they influence support (mis)matches. Challenging recipient‐centred perspectives on support in previous research, we emphasize the role of perception and communication between support providers and recipients. These insights provide practical guidance for organizations aiming to empower refugees while minimizing the risk of marginalization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;ThisCounterpointchallenges Fleming and Oswick’s (2025)Pointpaper and their notion ofloosely coupled abduction. Whereas theirPointemphasizes how abductive theorizing can balance creativity and rigor through consensus‐based plausibility, we argue that this very reliance on consensus carries epistemic risks. Specifically, abductively posited mechanisms may become established through repetition and shared acceptance rather than empirical verification. We define this heuristic process assemiotic abduction,an unintended consequence of the consensus rule emphasized in thePoint. Whereas thePointemphasizes how abduction can be disciplined in the formation of theory, beginning with anomalies and gaining plausibility through informed consensus, we highlight the danger that such mechanisms may gain traction without sufficient validation. Semiotic abduction, we argue, risks fostering mechanism drift, theoretical ambiguity, and the fragmentation of research domains around unverified assumptions. We conclude by offering recommendations to mitigate these risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been increasingly linked to entrepreneurship, yet existing findings remain fragmented and, at times, contradictory. This meta-analysis synthesizes 298 effect sizes from 47 studies to examine the relationships between ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, total symptoms, and clinical diagnosis) and entrepreneurial attitudes, behaviors, and post-launch outcomes. The results show hyperactivity/impulsivity is positively associated with entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviors, but not significantly related to post-launch outcomes. Conversely, inattention is negatively associated with post-launch outcomes. Total ADHD symptoms and diagnosis are positively related to entrepreneurial behaviors, yet negatively linked to outcomes. We conclude by proposing directions for future research.JEL code:L26, I10, J24</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This Special Section of theStrategic Entrepreneurship Journalexplores how business model innovation (BMI) can address grand challenges (GCs), includingartificial intelligence (AI),business and global unrest, andclimate change through a proposed “ABC” classification and “BMI‐GC” concept. Highlighting BMI's role as a boundary‐spanning, collaborative approach to innovation, we demonstrate its potential to drive sustainable solutions by rethinking value creation, delivery, and capture mechanisms. We examine how BMI may foster resilience and help firms and organizations adapt to global volatility, integrate ethical AI, and advance sustainability in business ecosystems. We offer a roadmap for future inquiry into BMI‐GC, including measurement and assessment, digital transformation, and collaborative ecosystems. By embracing these research pathways, scholars can contribute to a deeper theoretical and practical understanding of BMI to address grand challenges.Managerial SummaryWe investigate how business model innovation (BMI) can help tackle pressing global challenges (GCs), includingartificial intelligence (AI),business and global unrest, andclimate change, captured in a proposed “ABC” classification and “BMI‐GC” concept. We illustrate how BMI can help firms and organizations create sustainable, resilient, and future‐proof solutions. Practical strategies include integrating ethical AI, embedding flexibility in business models to withstand volatility, and adopting sustainable practices that align with regulatory and market demands supported by BMI. The paper identifies key opportunities for businesses to rethink how they create and deliver value, and foster collaboration across ecosystems. Through the ABC classification and BMI‐GC concept, we show how BMI can help enhance competitive advantage while responding proactively to the complexities of a rapidly changing world.</content>

    <title>Developing opportunities in times of crisis: The interactive effects of corporate entrepreneurs' emotional reactions and psychological climates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how corporate entrepreneurs' emotional reactions to the business impact of a crisis interact with psychological climates to drive engagement in opportunity formation. Drawing on affective events theory and psychological climate theory, we posit that positive emotional reactions increase engagement in opportunity formation when the psychological climate for initiative is strong, and negative emotional reactions increase engagement when the psychological climate for psychological safety is strong. Conversely, these relationships become negative when these climates are weak. An analysis of data from an eight‐wave longitudinal investigation involving 126 corporate entrepreneurs supports our predictions. By uncovering how corporate entrepreneurs' emotional reactions interact with climates for initiative and psychological safety, we illuminate the affective foundations of opportunity formation and show how organizations can foster climates that channel emotions into entrepreneurial action.Managerial SummaryThis study examines how corporate entrepreneurs' emotional reactions to crises interact with psychological climates to shape entrepreneurial actions. Our findings demonstrate that organizations should cultivate climates characterized by high personal initiative and psychological safety among middle managers. Managers' perceptions of such climates effectively harness both positive and negative emotional reactions for productive entrepreneurial actions, thereby facilitating corporate entrepreneurship. These insights are particularly marked for firms in disrupted industries, where conventional business approaches become obsolete in a crisis. Absent such organizational climates, managers' emotional reactions can discourage them from taking initiative on new opportunities, making it more difficult for the organization to transform and adapt.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new model of monetary policy implementation to account for two key developments: (i) the introduction of intraday liquidity requirements and (ii) the decreasing relevance of the federal funds market in favor of repurchase agreement (repo) markets with nonbank participants. Our paper studies how liquidity requirements prevent banks from arbitraging between the fed funds and repo markets and generate large repo spikes. We propose a simple measure of excess intraday reserves. Consistent with our theory, this metric is close to zero in 2019Q2, when U.S. repo markets experienced a spike of 400 basis points.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04037 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Delay in negotiations is common in many settings, but the effects of delay have rarely been studied empirically in the field. We measure the causal effects of delay on bargaining outcomes using data from millions of negotiations on eBay. We find that for both buyers and sellers, the longer the bargaining party delays, the less likely the opponent is to continue the negotiation by countering, and the fewer rounds the negotiation takes to complete. The effects of delay are robust; they exist even under short amounts of delay (under six hours) and for negotiations for low-priced goods. We find that these effects are consistent with models of strategic delay, in which delay acts as a signal of bargaining power.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01562 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that public charities with corporate directors on their boards are more likely to lobby on behalf of connected corporate interests. We document this result using granular fixed effects and alternative measures, excluding donor firms, focusing on specific legislation bills, and shocks to board connections. The effects of connections are stronger when firms face more competition, have better corporate governance, and are more exposed to political risks. Through connected charity lobbying, firms enjoy political benefits in the form of governmental procurement contracts. Policies aimed at improving the transparency of nonprofits help discipline charities who would otherwise seek funding benefits through procorporate lobbying activities. Our results highlight directors’ charitable engagement as a complementary avenue for corporate political activities.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00165 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traders operating in informal economies tend to use nonaccounting metrics in their credit allocation decisions. By using a combination of survey questions and a hypothetical choice experiment, we explore wholesalers’ preferences for retailers’ accounting information and, importantly, the reasons for its limited use. Based on estimates of wholesalers’ willingness to pay for retailer information, we find that, although wholesalers continue to value nonaccounting information such as retailers’ community membership and relationship length, wholesalers also overwhelmingly value sales and profits in making credit decisions. However, wholesalers do not use accounting information because it is perceived to be unreliable, and retailers do not share this information because it might be misused. Our findings suggest that improving the reliability of accounting information and preventing its misuse will increase the use of such information in credit allocation in informal markets.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first sample complexity lower bounds for the estimation of simple diffusion models, including the Bass model (used in modeling consumer adoption) and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model (used in modeling epidemics). We show that one cannot hope to learn such models until quite late in the diffusion. Specifically, we show that the time required to collect a number of observations that exceeds our sample complexity lower bounds is large. For the Bass model, our results imply that when new adopters are predominantly driven by imitation, one cannot hope to predict the eventual number of adopting customers until one is at least two-thirds of the way to the time at which the rate of new adopters is at its peak. In a similar vein, our results imply that in the case of an SIR model, one cannot hope to predict the eventual number of infections until one is approximately two-thirds of the way to the time at which the infection rate has peaked. This lower bound in estimation further translates into a lower bound in regret for decision making in epidemic interventions. Our results formalize the challenge of accurate forecasting and highlight the importance of incorporating additional data sources. To this end, we analyze the benefit of a seroprevalence study in an epidemic, where we characterize the size of the study needed to improve SIR model estimation. Extensive empirical analyses on product adoption and epidemic data support our theoretical findings.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 1727239].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02953 .</content>

    <title>Borrowing Based on Great Expectations: Evidence from the Origins of Fracking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use the origins of fracking to study how people respond to a large and uncertain permanent income shock. Following the arrival of news in 2003 that fracking was commercially viable, the average person owning rights to natural gas deposits in the Barnett Shale could plausibly expect to earn a present value of about $33,000 from leasing the rights to energy firms. Anticipating the income, people who signed leases after 2006 borrowed $5,400 more than nonleaseholders as of 2006. Leases not yet signed could not be collateralized, suggesting that expectations of increased permanent income rather than relaxed credit constraints drove leaseholder borrowing. A consumption smoothing model that uses observed well productivity and Hotelling’s rule for pricing nonrenewable resources suggests that borrowing as of 2006 was rational to conservative. When natural gas prices unexpectedly crashed during 2009–2019, leaseholders reduced their debt and had delinquency and bankruptcy rates that indicate limited financial distress, suggesting that their borrowing prior to signing a lease was not impulsive.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04214 .</content>

    <title>Utilities’ Managed Home Charging Programs for Electric Vehicles</title>
    <updated>2025-12-11T14:39:13+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Experts estimate 20 million electric vehicles will be on U.S. roads by 2030, and the majority (around 80%) of the electric vehicle drivers will use home charging. Many utilities are designing managed home charging programs to centrally manage charging times to reduce cost, avoid new and aggravated peaks and blackouts, and ensure grid stability. These managed home charging programs are either active, in which the utility continuously controls the charging while the vehicle is plugged in, or passive, in which the participants decide when to charge based on preannounced low-rate episodes. We study jointly designing and executing these active and passive programs. We present a program-design model, which produces a menu of the charging programs, tailored for each driver type, and a load-management model, which dynamically manages the load supply to each individual participant. The load-management model consists of a large number of nonhomogeneous participants, and it is a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear stochastic problem. We present an effective approximation method, conduct thorough theoretical and numerical analyses of our approximation, and provide worst-case bounds for its error components. Our methodology provides detailed insights on the amount and timing of the improvements achievable in cost and demand variability by offering managed home charging programs, and by customizing the passive programs. It also offers detailed insights on the significance of the tradeoff between cost and demand variability. We find promoting a culture of charging electric vehicles every night may significantly increase utilities’ total cost if passive programs have high participation levels.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00850 .</content>

    <title>Assuring the Crowd: The Role of Assurance in Securities Crowdfunding Success</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of CPA financial statement assurance in securities crowdfunding. Under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding, effective May 2016, early-stage private companies are permitted to conduct securities crowdfunding offerings—low-dollar securities offerings on Internet platforms—to a large number of investors. Using SEC filings and hand-collected data on the universe of offerings from 2016 to 2019, we examine the relation between CPA assurance and capital raised in the securities crowdfunding market. We fail to find evidence that issuers voluntarily seek higher levels of assurance, and we document high rates of noncompliance with the CPA assurance requirements. Our results suggest the on average positive association between CPA assurance and crowdfunding outcomes shown in prior research is explained by noncompliance with the Reg CF assurance requirements and is not driven by additional assurance. Overall, this study provides new insights of interest to crowdfunding issuers, investors, and regulators on the role of assurance in this nascent market of capital formation for startups.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03178 .</content>

    <title>Lemon Ads: Adverse Selection in Multichannel Display Advertising Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two auction-based channels play a crucial role in facilitating transactions of ad impressions in display advertising: real-time bidding (RTB), which is accessible to all advertisers, and private marketplace (PMP), which is restricted to a select group of advertisers through invitation-based agreements with publishers. Despite the ongoing discourse on the benefits and drawbacks of these two channels, how their coexistence influences the market dynamics and outcomes remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate this question by focusing on the welfare implications of publishers’ channel adoption. First, using a game-theoretic model, we show that publishers who use both RTB and PMP can leverage their private information on impression quality to sell lower-quality impressions at higher prices in RTB, leading to adverse selection and exposing their RTB-only counterparts to losses. To validate our theoretical prediction, we conduct an empirical analysis using a large proprietary data set. The results provide strong evidence of the presence of adverse selection. In particular, we find that, all else being equal, RTB impressions from dual-channel publishers are of significantly lower quality compared with those from single-channel publishers. Our findings shed light on the nuanced dynamics between RTB and PMP and contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay of informational and strategic factors in the display advertising market.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03407 .</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Writing Assistance on Jobseekers’ Resumes Increases Hires</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is a strong association between writing quality in resumes for new labor market entrants and whether they are ultimately hired. We show this relationship is, at least partially, causal: In a field experiment in an online labor market with nearly half a million jobseekers, treated jobseekers received nongenerative algorithmic writing assistance on their resumes. Treated jobseekers were hired 8% more often at 10% higher wages. Contrary to concerns that the assistance takes away a valuable signal, we find no evidence that employers were less satisfied. We find that the writing on treated jobseekers resumes had fewer errors and was easier to read. Our analysis suggests that writing is an imperfect signal of ability but better writing helps employers ascertain ability through clearer writing, suggesting digital platforms could benefit from incorporating nongenerative algorithmic writing assistance into text-based descriptions of labor services or products.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using gender to identify analyst groups, we examine whether in-group bias affects the behavior of sell-side equity analysts and the information dissemination process. We find that analysts hold more optimistic and less accurate earnings expectations for firms with same-gender CEOs, where in-group bias is stronger among men. Greater exposure to out-of-group individuals weakens in-group bias, and the bias is also weaker among analysts located in U.S. states with greater gender equality. Group definitions based on race/ethnicity and name similarity yield similar results. These findings are robust and unlikely to reflect selective information access or various selection effects.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01467 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A mixture of multinomial logits (mixed multinomial logit (MMNL)) generalizes the multinomial logit model, which is commonly used in modeling market demand to capture consumer heterogeneity. Although extensive algorithms have been developed in the literature to learn MMNL models, theoretical results are limited. Built on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, we propose a new algorithm that learns both mixture weights and component-specific logit parameters with provable convergence guarantees for an arbitrary number of mixtures. Our algorithm utilizes historical choice data to generate a set of candidate choice probability vectors, each being close to the ground truth with a high probability. We further provide a sample complexity analysis to show that only a polynomial number of samples is required to secure the performance guarantee of our algorithm. Finally, we apply the learned MMNL to data-driven multiproduct pricing problems and quantify how the estimation errors affect the pricing optimality under our proposed data-driven pricing framework Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Multi-Item Order Fulfillment Revisited: LP Formulation and Prophet Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this work, we revisit the multi-item order fulfillment model introduced by Jasin and Sinha (2015). Specifically, we study a dynamic setting in which an e-commerce platform (or online retailer) with multiple warehouses and finite inventory faces the problem of fulfilling orders that may contain multiple items. The platform’s goal is to minimize the expected cost incurred from the fulfillment process, subject to warehouses’ inventory constraints. Differing from the classical literature on multi-item fulfillment, we use the method-based formulation to design a class of dynamic policies that combine ideas from randomized fulfillment, prophet inequalities, and subgradient methods for the general multi-item fulfillment model. Specifically, by establishing connections between the fulfillment and prophet inequality literature, we prove that our algorithm has strong approximation guarantees in nonasymptotic settings, which also happens to be asymptotically optimal. Our result shows that there is a simple and near-optimal procedure for solving multi-item fulfillment problems once the online retailer has enough inventory, independent of other problem parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of this type in the context of multi-item order fulfillment. In addition, and of independent interest, our analysis also leads to new asymptotically optimal bounds for network revenue management problems.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, market design, platform, and demand analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00357 .</content>

    <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Sponsored Search Auctions and Impact of Ad Quality on Search Revenue</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents an empirical model of sponsored search auctions where advertisers are ranked by bid and ad quality. Our model is developed under the “incomplete information” setting with a general quality scoring rule. We establish nonparametric identification of the advertiser’s valuation and its distribution given observed bids and introduce novel nonparametric estimators. Using Yahoo! search auction data, we estimate value distributions and study the bidding behavior across product categories. We also conduct a counterfactual analysis to evaluate the impact of different quality scoring rules on the auctioneer’s revenue. Product-specific scoring rules can enhance auctioneer revenue by at most 24.3% at the expense of advertiser profit (−28.3%) and consumer welfare (−30.2%). The revenue-maximizing scoring rule depends on market competitiveness.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under the Insight Development Grant [Grant 430-2022-00841] to D.

    <title>The Economics of Advice: Evidence from Start-up Mentoring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of advice in early firm development and growth, drawing on detailed data from a global program where angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) mentored founders over several months. Leveraging variation in mentors’ availability to support start-ups because of personal scheduling conflicts, I find that advice significantly improves start-ups’ future market performance. To explore how advice shapes early firm development, I develop a novel typology of start-up activities, finding that a defining element of mentors’ advice is to do less and learn more. Although angels and VCs are consistent in this message, they differ significantly in when they choose to advise start-ups in achieving their business objectives. Angels are more likely than VCs to help founders design and execute product market experiments, whereas VCs provide more mentoring support on business analysis and planning tasks. I find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that experimentation is a skill developed via learning-by-doing, and angels have a skill advantage in that domain because of having more operational experience.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: The author acknowledges support from the Government of Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund [Grant 811949] and RBC Borealis Graduate Fellowship [Grant 2018-0439].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05115 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using novel data on 1,240 credit agreements, we investigate sources of contractual complexity in the leveraged loan market. Although negative covenants are widespread, carve-out and deductible clauses that qualify them are as frequent. We propose simple and comprehensive measures of contractual weakness based on the usage of such clauses. The economic significance of the actions allowed by these clauses and the market-wide price reaction that followed the 2017 J.Crew restructuring, a high-profile use of such contractual elements, support this interpretation. Leveraged buyouts, large transactions, and nonbank funding are conducive to weaker contractual terms for credit agreements.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01496 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lending relationships matter for firm financing. In a model of debt dynamics, we study how lending relationships are formed and how they impact the joint choice of leverage and debt maturity, thereby rationalizing recent empirical findings and generating new predictions. In the model, lending relationships evolve through repeated interactions between firms and debt investors. Stronger lending relationships lead firms to adopt higher leverage ratios, issue longer term debt, and raise funds from nonrelationship lenders via syndicated loans or bonds issues when relationship quality is sufficiently high. Debt contracts involving nonrelationship investors have longer maturity than those exclusively issued to relationship investors.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Swiss Finance Institute, the Danish Finance Institute, and the Center for Financial Frictions [Grant DNRF102].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02415 .</content>

    <title>Strategic Residential Location Choice: How Parents Game Priorities in School Matching</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most school choice matching mechanisms employed in theory and practice assume that schools rank students by characteristics that cannot be manipulated. However, parents may have incentives to misstate information used for determining school priorities, such as the proximity of the residential address to a school, particularly when such misrepresentations are difficult to detect or carry minimal penalties. If manipulation of school priorities occurs, the efficiency and fairness of the matching mechanism may be affected. Using official registration data on 330,000 children from the city of Vienna, I demonstrate that such strategic parental behavior occurs and establish lower bounds for its prevalence. Some parents register their child at a different residential address a few months before applying to a school and change the official residential address back to the original address after the child has been successfully enrolled. Migrants and families with lower education levels are less likely to game the system. A survey among 1,300 parents of first graders suggests that this negatively affects parents and children who are sincere.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The parents survey was funded by the Institute for Markets and Strategy, Vienna University of Economics and Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03711 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide novel evidence that aggregate investor attention to stocks predicts marketwide returns, but with a striking difference across investor clienteles. Daily aggregate retail attention (ARA) negatively predicts one-week-ahead market returns, is associated with aggregate retail order imbalance and flows to equity mutual funds, and exhibits a stronger predictability during periods of high marketwide uncertainty, poor liquidity, or more costly short selling. In contrast, aggregate institutional attention (AIA), when observed before major news announcements, positively predict future marketwide returns. In cross-sectional analysis, we show that the predictability is stronger for ARA among illiquid stocks and for AIA among high-beta stocks. The predictability results are robust out-of-sample and correspond to meaningful expected utility gains even for diversified investors. The findings are consistent with the idea that attention-driven retail buying can generate an aggregate price pressure on the stock market, whereas institutional attention precedes the resolution of marketwide uncertainty and the accrual of risk premiums.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: J.

    <title>The Role of Monitoring Effect in Risk Classification: Evidence from Telematics Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) empowers firms to collect and analyze individual consumers’ activities to classify customer types based on their actions and behaviors that are traditionally unobservable. Although behavioral tracking has become more prevalent in practice, its effectiveness in classifying customer types has hardly been discussed. We utilize detailed individual-level data from a field experiment conducted by an insurance company and its car rental partner to show that tracking using IoT devices such as telematics induces a monitoring effect that sways consumers to behave differently than usual when they are monitored, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of using temporal behavioral tracking data to classify individual types. More importantly, the magnitude of the monitoring effect is correlated with drivers’ unobserved inherent behavior, the very behavior that the tracking devices target to uncover. This correlation is fundamentally different from the typical heterogeneity in effects driven by observable characteristics. Our exercise demonstrates that even if firms recognize the existence of the monitoring effect, overlooking this correlation can more than double the misclassification rate, rendering the classification strategy less effective compared with the traditional classification approach based on customer profiles and sensitive to customer self-selection. Furthermore, we show that the monitoring effect spills over into the postmonitoring period and manifests through both habit formation and crowd-out effects. The direction and the magnitude of the postmonitoring effect vary across individuals. These findings alert practitioners about the caveats in utilizing temporal behavioral tracking data to classify customer types. Suggestive solutions for firms to properly adjust for the influence of the monitoring effect are also provided.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do dealers use their financing discretion to charge higher interest rate markups to high-risk customers? We use unique transaction-level data to examine finance and vehicle profits in the subprime auto market with three main results. First, financing subprime customers is costly for dealerships because of loan discounts that are only partially offset by proceeds from interest rate markups. Second, financing is costliest to dealers for deep subprime customers with low credit scores and low incomes. Third, instead of offsetting financing costs, vehicle markups are lowest for deep subprime customers. Finance margins and vehicle markups are also positively correlated more generally.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04086 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock and bond prices of a country move together with increasing country-specific risk. Bonds effectively hedge growth expectation risk when country-specific risk is low, resulting in a negative stock-bond correlation. However, as country-specific risk increases, hedging is less effective because (1) rising domestic prices tend to reduce a country’s growth potential and (2) global growth expectation shocks are more persistent than country-specific ones. Consequently, countries with greater country-specific risk exhibit a relatively positive stock-bond correlation. Equity investments in these countries outperform those with negative relationships by 7%–11% annually. The superior performance is not driven by investing in a fixed set of countries.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmidt, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Yonsei University [Grant 2024-22-0467].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07047 .</content>

    <title>Beyond IID: Data-Driven Decision Making in Heterogeneous Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, for example, because of the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot “correct” for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims to analyze the performance of central data-driven policies and also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments, and it aims to understand key drivers of performance. We establish a first result that allows us to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by sample average approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate, through several widely studied problems—for example, newsvendor, pricing—how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results toward a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03448 .</content>

    <title>Automated Enforcement and Traffic Safety</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traffic safety poses a persistent challenge for society and public policy. Conventional law enforcement by human police is often cost-ineffective because of information asymmetry and negative externalities of unsafe driving behaviors. Automated enforcement, in the form of traffic cameras on the road, has gained prominence in recent decades, yet its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms remain debated. This study examines the impact of traffic cameras on road safety using longitudinal data from a metropolitan city in China. We distinguish between advanced cameras, which use machine learning to detect various traffic violations and constantly record video, and conventional cameras, which rely on triggered image capture for a limited number of violations. Using an event study design with staggered camera installations at road intersections, we observe a significant and sustained reduction in accidents near advanced cameras, compared with locations with no cameras or only conventional cameras. Further analysis identifies three key mechanisms driving the effects of advanced cameras: (i) automated detection effect—superior technical capabilities to automate violation detection; (ii) real-time recording effect—continuous monitoring and recording capability to augment accident cause identification; and (iii) driver learning effect—technology-enabled deterrence that increases driver awareness of these cameras and encourages behavioral adjustments to mitigate accident risks. This study contributes to information systems, transportation economics, and criminology, offering policy insights into the effective design and deployment of automated enforcement to improve traffic safety.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is widespread concern about the lack of transparency regarding standard essential patents (SEPs). This paper examines the proposal to introduce essentiality checks, a certification scheme for declared SEPs. We develop a framework that allows us to evaluate how essentiality checks would impact licensing, litigation, and incentives to innovate. In our model, an upstream innovator invests in R&amp;D and privately learns about the likely essentiality of its patents for a standard. The innovator then licenses the patents to a downstream implementer who can contest the essentiality of the patents in court. We show that, although essentiality checks can reduce litigation, they also raise incentives for R&amp;D investment. Because the latter can be excessive if FRAND requirements are ineffective and spillovers are small, the overall welfare impact of essentiality checks is ambiguous.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: C.

    <title>Bank Compensation for the Penalty-Free Loan Prepayment Option: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While it is standard for corporate bonds to include a loan cancellation fee, a surprising 90% of tranche A commercial and industrial term loans allow borrowers to prepay the loan without penalty. We use a simple framework with dynamic learning to derive testable implications for the required bank compensation when including a penalty-free prepayment option. In this framework, after loan origination, borrowers receive noncontractible public information about the value of the project funded by the bank loan. This information causes some ex post high-value borrowers to prepay or renegotiate the loan to obtain a lower rate, deteriorating the credit quality of the bank’s remaining borrower pool. To avoid credit rationing of borrowers with a high prepayment risk, we show that the bank’s compensation must be in the form of an upfront fee rather than a higher initial loan rate, as the latter only exacerbates the adverse prepayment incentive. The model also accounts for the possibility that in relationship lending, an upfront fee may dominate a loan cancellation fee when the latter triggers costly ex post bargaining with high-value clients. To test model predictions, we construct a prepayment risk index, which contains proxies for borrower upside potential and loan renegotiation costs, and we use aggregate industry-level merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as an instrument for exogenous variation in loan prepayment risk. The tests support that upfront fees increase with borrower prepayment risk. In addition, upfront fees are lower for credit lines and loans with performance-sensitive pricing, as predicted.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: Partial financial support from Tuck’s Lindenauer Forum for Corporate Governance (Eckbo) and from the Norwegian Research Council [Grant 273678] (Thorburn and Su) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00159 .</content>

    <title>Textual Factors: A Scalable, Interpretable, and Data-Driven Approach to Analyzing Unstructured Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a general approach for analyzing large-scale text-based data, combining the strengths of neural network language processing and generative statistical modeling to create a factor structure of unstructured data for downstream regressions typically used in social sciences. We generate textual factors by (i) representing texts using vector word embedding, (ii) clustering the vectors using locality-sensitive hashing to generate supports of topics, and (iii) identifying relatively interpretable spanning clusters (i.e., textual factors) through topic modeling. Our data-driven approach captures complex linguistic structures while ensuring computational scalability and economic interpretability, plausibly attaining certain advantages over and complementing other unstructured data analytics used by researchers, including emergent large language models. We conduct initial validation tests of the framework and discuss three types of its applications: (i) enhancing prediction and inference with texts, (ii) interpreting (non–text-based) models, and (iii) constructing new text-based metrics and explanatory variables. We illustrate each of these applications using examples in finance and economics such as macroeconomic forecasting from news articles, interpreting multifactor asset pricing models from corporate filings, and measuring theme-based technology breakthroughs from patents. Finally, we provide a flexible statistical package of textual factors for online distribution to facilitate future research and applications.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Becker Friedman Institute of Economics, the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, INQUIRE Europe, the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, and the Risk Institute at OSU Fisher College of Business (while L.

    <title>Backup Plans: The Impact of Disclosure on Perceptions of Expert Competence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People often consult experts to provide solutions to their problems. Oftentimes, an initial attempt to solve a problem fails, and these experts (e.g., advisors, consultants, specialists, and service providers) will resort to a backup plan. A backup plan can be presented when it is needed (i.e., after an initial failure) or in advance (i.e., before a potential failure). We examine how the timing of disclosure of a backup plan affects judgments of an expert’s competence. We show that although people expect experts to have a backup plan, they react more negatively if it is presented after (versus before) it is needed, all things equal. This “competence penalty” disappears when people are prompted to think about what an expert would do in case of failure as indeed, an alternative plan is expected. Importantly, our findings indicate that there is no competence penalty for early disclosure of a backup plan, regardless of the outcome of the initial plan: if it has failed, has succeeded, or is still ongoing. However, we do find one exception; early disclosure has a negative impact if multiple backup plans are disclosed while the initial plan is in progress.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funding for all studies was provided by the MUMA College of Business, University of South Florida.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02615 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to support high-stakes decisions. However, there is frequently a construct gap: a gap between the construct of interest to the decision-making task and what is captured in proxies used as labels to train ML models. As a result, ML models may fail to capture important dimensions of decision criteria, hampering their utility for decision support. Thus, an essential step in the design of ML systems for decision support is selecting a target label among available proxies. In this work, we explore the use of historical expert decisions as a rich—yet also imperfect—source of information that can be combined with observed outcomes to narrow the construct gap. We argue that managers and system designers may be interested in learning from experts in instances where they exhibit consistency with each other while learning from observed outcomes otherwise. We develop a methodology to enable this goal using information that is commonly available in organizational information systems. This involves two core steps. First, we propose an influence function-based methodology to estimate expert consistency indirectly when each case in the data are assessed by a single expert. Second, we introduce a label amalgamation approach that allows ML models to simultaneously learn from expert decisions and observed outcomes. Our empirical evaluation, using simulations in a clinical setting and real-world data from the child welfare domain, indicates that the proposed approach successfully narrows the construct gap, yielding better predictive performance than learning from either observed outcomes or expert decisions alone.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [Grant R01NS124642], Good Systems, University of Texas at Austin, the Metro 21 Institute, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [Grant FA8750-17-2-0130], the National Science Foundation [Grant 1939606], Google [Award for Inclusion Research], and the UK Medical Research Council [Grants MC UU 00002/2, MC UU 00002/5, and MC UU 00040/02–Precision Medicine].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01576 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the effects of incentive plans on the quantity and quality of creative production. We examine a serial publishing platform that switched from a uniform commission (UC) plan to a quantity-based commission (QBC) plan offering a bonus commission rate when writers’ production meets a preset threshold. Our analysis reveals that, for a given book, chapters published in the months when writers reached the preset threshold quantity, and thus earned bonus commission rates, exhibited higher quality, as measured by the chapter-to-chapter customer retention rate. Such a positive correlation was nonsignificant for books published under the UC plan. We interpret that the implementation of a QBC plan enhanced the complementarity between quantity and quality in the writers’ payoff function. Further empirical analysis shows that this effect persisted over time. Moreover, the degree of enhanced complementarity was lower for writers who earned commissions from multiple books. Our key result remains robust when measuring quality by reader comments sentiment. Overall, the findings underscore the critical role of well-designed incentives in enhancing the platform’s effectiveness in managing mass creativity.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the London School of Economics and Political Science [Internal Research Fund, Department of Management], the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [Yuk-Shee Chan Professorship Fund], the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto [China Research Initiative Grant], and McGill University [Desautels Faculty of Management Research Support F].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I develop an analytical model to examine the effect of disclosure on organizational structure. In this model, an owner with two investment projects decides whether to organize them as a single multidivisional firm or two stand-alone firms whose manager(s) may issue a truthful but costly disclosure of each project’s profitability to raise capital. In a multidivisional firm, capital is initially provided by investors and subsequently allocated across the two projects by the manager. The analysis shows that a multidivisional structure allows for efficient internal capital allocation while avoiding disclosure costs, whereas a stand-alone structure prevents inefficient cross-subsidization. Specifically, a multidivisional structure is optimal when disclosure costs are high relative to project payoffs. These results help explain empirical evidence that multidivisional firms tend to trade at a discount.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Ananthakrishnan, accounting.</content>

    <title>Robustly Optimal Contracts for Agricultural Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because of various factors (such as a lack of adequate statistical knowledge or data, unforeseen weather events), the yields of agricultural products often exhibit a high level of ambiguity. When facing distributional ambiguity in yields, farmers and landowners may base their contracting decisions on descriptive statistics, such as the mean and variance. To investigate how limited information could reshape optimal contract forms, we consider an agricultural supply chain in which a landowner contributes farmland and a skilled farmer exerts costly private effort to cultivate a crop. Both parties face distributional ambiguity in crop yield and employ a robust max-min decision rule. When the landowner possesses the bargaining power to draft the contract (the L model), we find that a hybrid contract of debt and equity is robustly optimal. In contrast, when the farmer possesses the bargaining power (the F model), the optimal contract could be a linear (equity) contract or a nonlinear quadratic debt contract, depending on the coefficient of variation (CV) and the landowner’s reservation profit. We use U.S. Department of Agriculture data to calibrate the model and find that, as the CV increases, the party that possesses the bargaining power tends to share more risk. We also find that when both the CV and the landowner’s reservation profit are sufficiently large, the L model induces a higher effort level; otherwise, the F model achieves better effort. Finally, we extend the model to consider various features, such as random crop price, farmer’s risk aversion and bounded crop yield.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: G.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can algorithms help people detect deception in high-stakes strategic interactions? Participants watching the preplay communication of contestants in the TV show Golden Balls display a limited ability to predict contestants’ behavior, whereas algorithms do significantly better. To increase participants’ accuracy, we provide them with algorithmic advice by flagging videos for which an algorithm predicts a high likelihood of cooperation or defection. We test how the effectiveness of flags depends on their timing. We show that participants rely significantly more on flags shown before they watch the videos than flags shown after they watch them. These findings show that the timing of algorithmic feedback is key for its adoption.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funding provided by an Innovation Grant for Inclusive Research Excellence at UC San Diego.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02792 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Learning with Online Convex Optimization: Theory and Application to Medical Decision-Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing the treatment regimen is a fundamental medical decision-making problem. This can be thought of as a two-dimensional decision-making problem with a nested structure because it involves determining both the optimal medication and its optimal dose. Identifying the most effective medication for an individual often poses considerable difficulty, and even when a suitable medication is ascertained, dosing it optimally remains a significant challenge. Making these two nested decisions necessitates the adaptive learning of a personalized disease progression control model. To address this problem, we propose a novel contextual multiarmed bandit model under a two-dimensional control with a nested structure. For this model, we develop a new joint contextual learning and optimization algorithm, termed the stochastic subgradient descent atop contextual multiarmed bandit (SGD-MAB) algorithm. It sequentially selects for a patient (i) the best medication based on their contextual information and (ii) the corresponding dose optimized over the prior history of those patients who received the same medication. We prove that it admits a sublinear regret, which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our regret analysis leverages the strengths of both contextual bandit approaches and online convex optimization techniques in a seamless fashion. We substantiate the practicality of SGD-MAB using clinical data on patients with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risks. Our analysis indicates that SGD-MAB has the potential to surpass current practices. We benchmark several policies to show the advantages of our approach and offer critical insights. Our framework holds promise for various applications beyond healthcare that require nested decision-making.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses an important class of restless multiarmed bandit (RMAB) problems that finds broad application in operations research, stochastic optimization, and reinforcement learning. There are N independent Markov processes that may be operated, observed and offer rewards. Due to the resource constraint, we can only choose a subset of [Formula: see text] processes to operate and accrue reward determined by the states of selected processes. We formulate the problem as a partially observable RMAB with an infinite state space and design an algorithm that achieves a near-optimal performance with low complexity. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of Whittle’s original idea of indexability. Referred to as the relaxed indexability, the extended definition leads to the efficient online verifications and computations of the approximate Whittle index under the proposed algorithmic framework.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02831 .</content>

    <title>Is Relevancy Everything? A Deep-Learning Approach to Understand the Effect of Image-Text Congruence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly use a combination of image and text description when displaying products and engaging consumers. Existing research has examined consumers’ response to text and image stimuli separately but has yet to systematically consider how the semantic relationship between image and text impacts consumer choice. In this research, we conduct a series of multimethod empirical studies to examine the congruence between image- and text-based product representation. First, we propose a deep-learning approach to measure image-text congruence by building a state-of-the-art two-branch neural network model based on wide residual networks and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. Next, we apply our method to data from an online reading platform and discover a U-shaped effect of image-text congruence: Consumers’ preference toward a product is higher when the congruence between the image and text representation is either high or low than when the congruence is at the medium level. We then conduct experiments to establish the causal effect of this finding and explore the underlying mechanisms. We further explore the generalizability of the proposed deep-learning model and our substantive finding in two additional settings. Our research contributes to the literature on consumer information processing and generates managerial implications for practitioners on how to strategically pair images and text on digital platforms.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disclosures about a business acquisition help investors understand what assets are acquired and how the acquiring company plans to benefit from the transaction. However, in practice, these disclosures exhibit significant variation and often fall short of providing meaningful information to investors. Our experiment provides evidence that separately identifying intangible assets acquired in a business combination (i.e., what was acquired) can compensate for shortcomings in an acquirer’s disclosures about how the transaction will benefit the acquiring firm. An additional experiment indicates that the benefits of separately identifying acquired assets do not extend to tangible assets, suggesting our insights may be unique to intangibles.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Z.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal workforce and contract design for a firm that employs a team of two agents. The agents have possibly diverse demographic characteristics captured by their discount factors. When both agents have relatively low discount factors (impatient agents), the optimal contract is designed to foster cooperation, whereas when both agents have relatively high discount factors (patient agents), the optimal contract is designed to both foster cooperation and prevent collusion. In preventing collusion, the principal optimally targets the less patient agent by offering him higher-powered incentives, while the more patient agent is offered lower-powered incentives to promote cooperation. Offering high-powered incentives to the less patient agent, who is also less susceptible to collusion, makes it costlier for the more patient agent to bribe the less patient agent into colluding. The optimal workforce is a diverse one consisting of one agent with the highest discount factor and a second agent with a discount factor that is just low enough that both agents can be offered cooperative incentives without inviting collusion. We also study optimal team design for four agents with given discount factors—two with low discount factors and two with high discount factors—who are to be assigned to two teams and identify conditions under which diverse assignment is optimal.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether and how standardized gender diversity disclosure requirements affect women’s representation on corporate boards. Our analysis takes advantage of Canada’s 2014 regulation, which requires disclosures of consistent and comparable information on boards’ gender diversity policies and guidelines. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the disclosure regulation increases women’s representation on boards. The increase is more pronounced among firms with stronger shareholder oversight as proxied by ownership from environmental, social, and governance (ESG)–friendly investors, poor diversity performance preregulation, Toronto Stock Exchange index membership, and U.S. cross-listing. In addition, after the regulation, firms that make stronger diversity commitments (e.g., disclosing the adoption of written diversity policies and diversity targets) experience a higher increase in ownership by foreign ESG-friendly investors. Together, our findings suggest that standardized disclosure requirements enable shareholders to be better monitors, thereby improving board gender balance.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00509 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an empirical measure of the types of financial misreporting based on misreporting incentives. We identify three distinct types: (1) misreporting driven by top executives’ wealth pursuits, (2) misreporting induced by capital market pressure, and (3) misreporting by subordinates due to inadequate management oversight. Our measure is developed by conducting a detailed analysis of the textual data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases. We also provide rigorous empirical validations. Additionally, we create a composite misreporting severity score that incorporates the three misreporting incentives. Using our measure of misreporting incentives, we help reconcile previous mixed findings on the link between equity incentives and financial misreporting. Furthermore, in predicting market reactions to misreporting, our misreporting severity score outperforms a measurement that does not integrate misreporting incentives. Our measures can be practical tools for investigating a wide range of research questions related to the causes and consequences of financial misreporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 [Grants RG101/22 and RG59/17].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00160 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To best utilize labor, companies need to match employees’ skills with jobs that best fit those skills. Exploiting unique features of the mutual fund industry, we identify instances when this matching happens for fund managers and study its consequences. When fund managers are matched, they deliver a significantly higher risk-adjusted performance. Fund companies use this information to maximize company value by increasing assets under the management of these managers (i.e., assigning them to more and larger funds) and by collecting higher fees from these managers’ funds. In addition, they make the expertise of these managers available to other managers of the fund company.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02805 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we examine how financial reporting regulations—limits on earnings management and auditing—affect disclosure quality and market efficiency. Our findings indicate that a tight limit and the possibility of an audit enhance the informativeness of earnings disclosures, leading to improved pricing efficiency while a weak limit deteriorates disclosure quality and pricing efficiency. Financial reporting regulations enhance disclosure quality via both constraining earnings management practices and inducing signaling behavior. Auditing more effectively boosts social welfare by suppressing manipulation, whereas limits trigger overinvestment in costly signal. Our results also shed light on previously contradictory empirical findings regarding financial reporting regulations.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two commentaries by Tormala and Rucker and by Critcher and Galak offer complementary perspectives on our target article,Changing BeliefsversusChanging Behavior. Tormala and Rucker emphasize attitudes as proximal determinants of behavior, underscoring the importance of attitude strength and measurement compatibility. Critcher and Galak propose a contextual continuum of decision making that situates belief influence within unprompted, opportunity‐based, and prompted behavioral contexts, illustrating how contextual factors shape the recruitment of beliefs for specific actions. In this response, we clarify the relations among beliefs, attitudes, and context; address the misconception that our model overemphasizes inferential reasoning; and extend the framework to integrate evaluative and contextual determinants of behavior. This synthesis offers a comprehensive account in which attitudes function as inferential products of belief processing, while contexts determine when and how these processes are activated.</content>

    <title>Choice and Opportunity Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We define the (physical) opportunity cost of a choice x as the alternative that would be chosen if x were not available, and the opportunity cost of any unchosen alternative as x itself. The agent has preferences over pairs consisting of alternatives and their opportunity costs. Because costs affect choice and vice-versa, choice results from an intrapersonal equilibrium rather than from simple maximisation. In spite of significant rationality assumptions, the resulting behaviour can be highly non-standard, allowing intransitive choices. Rational utility maximisation is ensured by an additional new consistency condition on preferences. However, we argue that the maximised utility cannot be straightforwardly interpreted as a welfare relevant “revealed preference”. A generalisation of our model accommodates additional departures from standard rationality in the form of menu effects.</content>

    <title>The Fog of Warnings: How Non-Security-Related Notifications Diminish the Efficacy of Security Warnings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users’ disregard of security warnings is a critical problem in cybersecurity. This problem worsens when people confuse security warnings with common, non-security-related notifications, which they learn to routinely disregard. We investigate this problem through the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization of habituation, where habituation to one stimulus transfers to another stimulus that shares similar characteristics. Generalization of habituation suggests that because of habituation to frequent notifications, people may also be deeply habituated to security warnings they have never seen before, leading to warning disregard. Furthermore, because generalization of habituation occurs unconsciously at the neurobiological level, this may occur even though a person can consciously distinguish security warnings from notifications. We address this problem through three experiments—two in the field and one using functional magnetic resonance imaging. These experiments demonstrate how generalization of habituation occurs and can be mitigated by differentiating warnings from notifications in terms of their visual appearance or mode of interaction. These findings provide guidance to software developers for designing warnings that resist generalization of habituation and promote greater warning adherence.</content>

    <title>How App Developers’ Boundary-Shifting Moves Reshape Competitive Dynamics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As digital platforms evolve, app developers do more than passively participate; they actively reshape the competitive landscape through boundary-shifting moves (BSMs). By modularizing boundary resources at different levels of the technology stack, developers can provoke, delay, or neutralize competitive responses in hypercompetitive app markets. Drawing on an empirical analysis of mobile apps launched by leading Chinese internet firms, we uncover a striking asymmetry in how rival developers react to these moves. Specifically, higher-level app modules—those tailored to particular application domains—tend to delay rival responses, while lower-level technical modules—broadly applicable across domains—trigger faster competitive reactions. This effect is heightened among firms with a history of direct competition, as they respond more aggressively to changes at the lower levels of modularization. By foregrounding the strategic role of technology stack levels in shaping competitive interactions, our study advances a differential resourcing perspective and offers new insights into the dynamics of competition within digital platforms. These findings challenge the dominant host platform-centric and cooperative views on boundary resources, illuminating how app developers actively reshape platform ecosystems to gain temporary advantage.</content>

    <title>Does Bot Gender Matter? Theory and Evidence From a High-Tension Service Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the increasing use of AI-powered voicebots, our understanding of how the choice of bot gender may impact service outcomes in high-tension service contexts, such as debt collection, remains limited. To address this gap, we drew on the tensions-based view of customer relationships and gender stereotype theory to hypothesize how and when voicebot gender matters in high-tension service contexts. We tested our hypotheses using a proprietary dataset of debt collection calls made by AI voicebots. We found that female voicebots increase the odds of a positive repayment intention by 28.3%. This gender effect is more pronounced when service encounters begin with higher tension, such as during weekdays or with initially uncooperative customers. We further show that the gender effect can be explained by the advantages of female voicebots in reducing behavioral and emotional tension during service interactions.</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Social Injustices: Antecedents and Mitigations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key assumption in data science is that the fairness of an algorithm depends on its accuracy. Antecedents that create accuracy problems are expected to reduce fairness and cause algorithmic social injustices. We theorize why complexities in ground truths, IT ecosystems, and statistical models of algorithms can also generate algorithmic social injustices, above and beyond the indirect effects of antecedents, through the mediation of accuracy problems. We also theorize technology design and organizational mitigation mechanisms for taming such complexities and reducing algorithmic social injustices. We tested the proposed theory in a sample of 363 matched pairs of problematic and problem-free algorithms. We found that complexities in ground truths affected algorithmic social injustices directly rather than through the mediation of accuracy problems. Failures in complex IT ecosystems of algorithms did not affect the likelihood of algorithmic social injustices, but they caused damage directly and indirectly through the mediation of accuracy problems. Failures in complex statistical models significantly increased algorithmic social injustices both directly and indirectly through the mediation of accuracy problems. The results indicate that agentic algorithms produce social injustices not only through accuracy problems but also through complexities in their ground truths, IT ecosystems, and statistical models. The proposed complexity taming mechanisms are effective in reducing algorithmic social injustice risks through (1) the user organization’s quality in managing the algorithm’s stakeholders, (2) designing algorithms with a large scope of human-like interaction capabilities, (3) the developer organization’s algorithmic risk mitigations, and (4) the user organization’s algorithmic risk mitigations.</content>

    <title>Judgmental Bot: Conversational Agents in Online Mental Health Screening</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Only a fraction of people with mental health issues seek medical care, in part because of fear of judgment, so deploying text-based conversational agents (i.e., chatbots) for mental health screening is often viewed as a way to lower barriers to mental health care. We conducted four experiments and a qualitative study and, contrary to common assumptions, consistently found that participants perceived a text-based chatbot as more judgmental than a human mental health care professional, even though the interactions were identical. This greater judgmentalness reduced the willingness to use the service, disclose information, and follow the agent’s recommendations. Participants described judgmentalness as a rush to judgment without fully grasping the issues. The chatbot was perceived as more judgmental because it was less capable of deeply understanding the issues (e.g., emotionally and socially) and conveying a sense of being heard and validated. It has long been assumed that chatbots can address the real or imagined fear of being judged by others for stigmatized conditions like mental health. Our study shows that perceptions of judgmentalness are actually the opposite of what has been assumed and that these perceptions significantly influence patients’ acceptance of chatbots for mental health screening.</content>

    <title>Different but the Same? An Event-Driven Approach to Determine Probabilities of Data Duplication</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The importance of data quality assessment, in general, and duplicate detection, in particular, has been recognized in both research and practice. Duplicates are known to cause critical problems in many domains, including customer relationship management, data management and data warehousing, fraud detection, production, and healthcare. Such duplicates are caused by events that are typically associated with data patterns in the records. For example, duplicates in customer databases caused by the event “relocation of a customer” characteristically exhibit dissimilar values for address-related features, while the values of the other features (e.g., name-related features) tend to be highly similar. Analyzing duplicate-related events and recognizing such patterns seems particularly promising for duplicate detection. However, existing approaches do not take advantage of this and neither consider events nor recognize their associated data patterns when detecting potential duplicates. In this paper, we introduce events as causes of duplicates and, on this basis, propose a novel probability-based approach for duplicate detection. Our approach assigns the probability of being a duplicate to each analyzed pair of data while avoiding limiting methodical assumptions of existing approaches. The evaluation on seven different datasets shows that our approach is able to outperform existing approaches and that the models learned can be transferred between datasets of the same domain without further labeling or repeated model learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of crowd characteristics on crowd value, which is measured by the improvement in the power to predict stock volatility using crowd-generated content. Leveraging a natural platform-wide event that changes the crowd compositions of S&amp;P 500 stock discussions, we found empirical evidence that content from a larger crowd size is associated with a higher crowd value. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of crowd size on crowd value decreases with increased diversity of the crowd’s background and the independence of the crowd’s opinions. Additionally, we found that crowd values derived using various machine learning algorithms exhibit different sensitivities to these crowd characteristics. Algorithms that can handle interrelated observations (i.e., non-independent) and potential nonlinear relationships among crowd-generated content are more robust in performance than algorithms that cannot. We discuss the mechanisms that drive these findings and highlight the implications of crowd diversity and crowd independence on model performances when analyzing crowd-generated content.</content>

    <title>Guardrails for Human-AI Ecologies: Norm-Based Coordination and Design for Predictability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human-AI ecologies involve human and AI-based agents that coordinate their interactions in part by following social norms. Social norms, therefore, are important for establishing the guardrails that ensure desirable interactions in a way that is consistent with essential values, such as human safety. Managing human-AI ecologies requires specifying norms to enable coordination in known situations but also allowing for the emergence of norms to enable coordination in unspecified, unstructured situations. We integrate predictive processing theory and social norm theory to explain how existing norms are enacted and reinforced based on agents’ predictive models and how new norms emerge as agents update their predictive models in response to prediction errors in uncertain coordination scenarios. Rooted in this perspective, we develop a design theory that emphasizes design for predictability and propose a set of design principles for managers and developers to encode norms to evolve in human-AI ecologies, monitor outcomes, and intervene when necessary.</content>

    <title>Deductive Certainty? Exploring the Boundaries of Trust Formation in Smart Contracts on Blockchains</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We offer a new perspective on trust formation in smart contracts on blockchain that is based on deduction rather than induction. This shift in perspective allows us to explore the boundaries of trust in IT systems, analyze the conditions under which trust becomes dispensable, and unpack the sociotechnical complexity of supposedly “trust-free” systems. Through this approach, we introduce three key concepts: deductive certainty, a state in which an individual has full knowledge of the other party’s future behavior based on deduction; the possibility of deductive certainty that an IT system may provide; and deduction-related trust, a new type of trust rooted in the possibility of deductive certainty. We use these concepts to analyze smart contracts on a blockchain as a technology that offers the potential for deductive certainty by enabling complete deduction. Our analysis reveals the conditions under which smart contract-based applications, also known as dApps, can become “trust-free” and why, in practice, they often are not. Based on a sample of 536 dApps and a user survey, we provide evidence supporting our theoretical claims. Our findings suggest that the possibility of deductive certainty plays a significant role in forming initial trust in dApps. However, we also find that new users rely on both deduction-related trust and classical inductive trust, with the two sources of trust reinforcing each other.</content>

    <title>RADAR: A Framework for Developing Adversarially Robust Cyber Defense AI Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is being widely adopted in modern cyber defense to weave automation and scalability into the operational fabric of cybersecurity firms. Today, AI aids in crucial cyber defense tasks such as malware and intrusion detection to keep information technology (IT) infrastructure secure. Despite their value, cyber defense AI agents can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In these attacks, the adversary deliberately manipulates a malicious input by taking a sequence of actions so that a targeted cyber defense AI agent fails to correctly determine its maliciousness. Consequently, the robustness of cyber defense AI agents has raised deep concerns in modern cyber defense. Drawing on the computational design science paradigm, we couple robust optimization and reinforcement learning theories to develop a novel framework, called reinforcement learning-based adversarial attack robustness (RADAR), to increase the robustness of cyber defense AI agents against adversarial attacks. To demonstrate practical utility, we instantiate RADAR for malware attacks—the primary cause of financial loss in cyber attacks. We rigorously evaluate the performance of RADAR as a situated IT artifact against state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning-based benchmark methods. Incorporating RADAR in three renowned malware detectors shows an adversarial robustness increase of up to seven times, on average. We conclude by discussing contributions to information system research as well as implications for cyber defense stakeholders.</content>

    <title>Real-Time Sales Data, Streamer Improvisation, and Sales Performance: Evidence From Live Stream Selling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live stream selling has surged as an innovative form of e-commerce, supporting high social interactivity and fast-paced sales for large-scale audiences. However, live streamers must manage complex, concurrent tasks— such as presenting products, engaging with viewers, and employing various sales tactics to facilitate consumer purchases, while dealing with uncertainty in foreseeing viewers’ reactions and time pressure for selling products. This study examines the role of real-time sales data in influencing streamers’ impromptu decision-making and sales outcomes in live stream selling. On the one hand, real-time sales data might exacerbate the already complex decision-making, overwhelming and distracting streamers. On the other hand, it may help streamers improvise their tactics and utilize time more efficiently and effectively to improve sales performance. In partnership with a leading global live stream selling platform, we analyzed data from a randomized field experiment to unravel whether, how, and under which conditions the provision of real-time sales data affects live stream sales performance. The streamers in the experiment were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which had access to real-time sales data for presale products, or the control group, which had no such access. Our results reveal that product sales of presale products in the treatment group increased by approximately 40.21% compared to those in the control group. Further, the observed main effect can be explained by streamers’ data-driven improvisation in promotional, linguistic, and presentational pace tactics. Moreover, heterogeneity analyses reveal that the positive effect of real-time data on sales performance is more salient for streamers with likely better improvisational skills and for products with higher uncertainty, thereby providing suggestive evidence of streamer improvisation as the underlying mechanism. This study contributes to the literature on data-driven decision-making, evidencing the importance of real-time data for enhancing decision-making processes and outcomes. Our findings also offer guidance for implementing real-time data infrastructure in live stream selling platforms.</content>

    <title>Mitigating Bias in Hate Speech Detection With a Small Number of Expert Annotations: A Prompt-Based Learning Approach</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hate speech is a major problem on social media platforms. Automatic hate speech detection methods relying on machine learning models, which learn from manually labeled datasets, have been proposed in both academia and industry. However, there is increasing evidence that hate speech detection datasets labeled by general annotators (e.g., amateurs or MTurk workers) contain systematic bias, as they cannot effectively consider language use differences among different speakers. When such biased datasets are used to train machine learning models, the resulting models will also be biased. Unlike general annotators, experts can produce much less biased annotations. However, expert annotations cannot be efficiently obtained in large quantities. This paper bridges the gap by adopting a weakly supervised learning method for hate speech detection using a small number of expert annotations. We propose a novel design that uses contrastive learning and prompt-based learning based on large language models, incorporating a group estimator, a pair generator, and knowledge injection. Using real-world Twitter posts written by African American English speakers and other racial groups as an example, extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. The proposed approach was also evaluated on data in the LGBTQ+ community and achieved consistent results. The study has important academic and practical implications for hate speech detection and large language models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers must ensure that the claims about the knowledge produced by their work are valid. However, validity is neither well-understood nor consistently established in design science, which involves the development and evaluation of artifacts (models, methods, instantiations, and theories) to solve problems. As a result, it is challenging to demonstrate and communicate the validity of knowledge claims about artifacts. This paper defines validity in design science and derives a “design science validity framework” and a process model for applying it. The framework comprises three high-level claim and validity types— criterion, causal, and context—as well as validity subtypes. The framework guides researchers in integrating validity considerations into projects employing design science and contributes to the growing body of research on design science methodology. It also provides a systematic way to articulate and validate the knowledge claims of design science projects. We apply the framework to examples from existing research and then use it to demonstrate the validity of knowledge claims about the framework itself.</content>

    <title>Behind Privacy Labels: Data Tracking and Advertising Competition on App Platforms</title>
    <updated>2025-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recently, a controversial new privacy policy on mobile app platforms, which requires app developers to display privacy labels and explicitly request data-tracking permissions from users, has sparked a heated discussion among practitioners in digital advertising. In this paper, we build a game-theoretic model to examine how this new policy impacts the key stakeholders of a mobile app platform (i.e., app developers, the platform, and consumers). The model captures how the new policy prompts developers to expand their strategies beyond pricing by introducing data-tracking levels as an additional competitive dimension, which in turn affects the intensity of price competition. We find that while implementing a policy restricting developers’ tracking of consumers may increase the platform’s advertising revenue, it can also put the platform at a disadvantage. This is because it may incentivize developers to lower their prices and engage in more intense price competition, consequently reducing the platform’s commission revenue. Regarding app developers, the new policy may prove beneficial despite its restriction to tracking only consumers who have opted in. Another noteworthy finding is that while platforms have asserted that the new policy is aimed at safeguarding consumers’ privacy, it does not always serve consumers’ best interests. Our paper provides meaningful implications for all key stakeholders of mobile app platforms regarding the implementation of the new privacy policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between corporate tax planning and firm-level productivity. Using a sample of U.S. public firms from 1993 to 2017, we find that tax planning is positively associated with productivity. Our findings further indicate that tax planning contributes to growth in production input factors: capital and labor. We also test the underlying mechanisms, documenting that the observed association between productivity and tax planning is more pronounced in financially constrained and knowledge capital–intensive firms. We exploit the initiation of new banking relationships and the introduction of Check-the-Box regulations as sources of tax planning variation to facilitate difference-in-differences analyses. The empirical evidence holds consistently across a wide array of robustness tests. Taken together, the results enhance the understanding on the economic implications of tax planning and provide insights for informed tax policy debates.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03569 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nonprogressive diffusion models the spread of behavior on social networks, where agents are allowed to reverse their decisions as time evolves. To provide an efficient framework for evaluating and optimizing nonprogressive diffusion, we introduce a comprehensive model along with a fixed-point approximation (FPA) scheme, which admits both theoretical guarantee and computational efficiency. We show that the approximation error depends on the network structure and derive order-optimal bounds for this error based on a newly proposed network measure. Additionally, we propose two easy-to-calculate network metrics (one at the node level and the other at the network level) that serve as reliable indicators of FPA performance. Our results indicate that the FPA scheme is particularly accurate for dense and large networks, which are typically challenging to analyze via simulation. To showcase the broad applicability of our approach, we apply the FPA scheme to well-known problems, like influence maximization and optimal pricing on social networks. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks. On real-world networks, the FPA scheme achieves computational speedups of 70–230 times compared with naïve agent-based simulation and 23–30 times compared with a more advanced simulation method while maintaining a mean absolute percentage error of less than 3.48%.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: R.

    <title>Promotion Architecture: A Deal Fairness Model of Restricted Price Promotions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines the effectiveness of two common types of restricted price promotions: threshold promotions (conditional on spending more than a threshold amount; e.g., “Get $5 off on orders of $10 or more”) and capped promotions (limited to a maximum dollar value; e.g., “Get 50% off, up to $5 per order”). Results from seven pre-registered studies, including one field study, show that threshold promotions lead to higher purchase intentions and conversion rates (but potentially lower purchase amounts) than comparable capped promotions—even though capped promotions are equivalent in maximal economic savings for the consumer—when the trigger value (the spending amount at which the promotion activates or caps) is low. This effect occurs because consumers have higher expected promotion levels for capped promotions and lower expected spending levels for threshold promotions, leading them to perceive the threshold promotion as a fairer deal. However, this effect reverses when the trigger value is high, where consumers perceive capped promotions as a fairer deal and prefer them to threshold promotions. The implications of our results for the optimal management of price promotion architectures were discussed.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using field and laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that the complexity of incentive schemes and worker bounded rationality can affect effort provision. This is because some attributes of the incentives become opaque; that is, workers do not take them into account. In our setting, workers overprovide effort relative to a fully rational benchmark, improving efficiency. We identify contract features, and facets of worker cognitive ability, that matter for opacity. We find that even relatively small degrees of opacity can cause large shifts in behavior. Our results illustrate important implications of complexity and bounded rationality for designing and regulating workplace incentive contracts. (JEL C90, D21, D91, J22, J31, J41)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider an economy with equal amounts of N types of goods, to be allocated to agents with strict quasi-convex preferences over lotteries. We show that ex ante, all Pareto-efficient allocations give almost all agents lotteries over at most two outcomes. Our results provide a simple criterion showing that many popular allocation mechanisms are ex ante inefficient. For the case of identical preferences, we establish existence of an efficient solution where all lotteries used are equally attractive. Assuming the reduction axiom, social welfare deteriorates by first randomizing over these binary lotteries. Efficient ex ante equality is achieved if agents satisfy the compound-independence axiom.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the firm responses and real wage effects of foreign demand shocks. We use Belgian microdata to construct firm-specific measures of demand shocks, which capture that firms pass on foreign demand shocks to domestic suppliers. Our estimates of firm responses to these shocks suggest that firms face upward-sloping labor supply curves and have sizable fixed labor costs. We specify a general equilibrium model with these features to quantify the aggregate effects of simulated tariff shocks on wages. We find that ignoring fixed labor costs substantially underestimates aggregate effects on wages, whereas incorporating upward-sloping labor supply appears less consequential.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on data gathered from 27,000 real-world meetings between financial advisors and clients of a large German bank, we show that advisors offer more self-serving advice to women, while men are more likely to receive sales fee rebates and less likely to be recommended expensive in-house multi-asset (IHMA) funds. Additional client and advisor surveys provide evidence consistent with statistical discrimination based on gender as a proxy for client financial sophistication, with female clients exhibiting lower financial literacy, confidence, and price sensitivity. Moreover, female advisors report less confidence in their own professional skills and engage in less discrimination than male colleagues. (JEL D83, G21, G51, G53, J16, L84)</content>

    <title>Supply, Demand, Institutions, and Firms: A Theory of Labor Market Sorting and the Wage Distribution</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how workforce composition, labor demand, and minimum wage jointly determine wages through their effects on worker-task assignments, firm wage premiums, and firm-worker sorting. Using an estimated model of monopsonistic local labor markets, it finds that minimum wage hikes and labor demand shocks drove the decline in Brazilian wage inequality from 1998 to 2012. While rising educational attainment compressed skill premiums within firms, it also reallocated skilled workers to high-wage firms, limiting that shock’s effect on inequality. The analysis highlights interactions among exogenous factors, showing that concurrent supply and demand changes attenuated minimum wage impacts. (JEL J22, J23, J24, J31, J38, J42, R23)</content>

    <title>Downward Rigidity in the Wage for New Hires</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wage rigidity is an important explanation for unemployment fluctuations. In benchmark models wages for new hires are key, but there is limited evidence on this margin. We use wages posted on vacancies, with job and establishment information, to measure the wage for new hires. We show that our measure of the wage for new hires is rigid downward and flexible upward, in two steps. First, wages change infrequently at the job level, and fall especially rarely. Second, wages do not respond to rises in unemployment, but respond strongly to falls in unemployment. Job information is crucial for detecting downward rigidity.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable framework for deficit and debt dynamics. A “free lunch” fiscal deficit—one that raises spending without higher future taxes—is sustainable without zero lower bound (ZLB) only when R &lt; G − φ, where φ is the sensitivity of the interest rate to the debt level. With the ZLB, both high and low deficits can increase debt, as the latter weaken demand and reduce nominal growth at the ZLB. A rise in income inequality expands fiscal space outside the ZLB, but contracts it at the ZLB. Calibrating the model, we find little space for “free lunch” policies for the United States in 2019, but significant space for Japan. (JEL D31, E23, E43, E62, H62, H63)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;High school students from non-elite backgrounds are less likely to have peers with elite-educated parents than their elite counterparts. This difference in social capital is a key driver of the high intergenerational persistence in elite education. We identify a positive elite peer effect on enrollment in elite programs and labor market earnings, then disentangle underlying mechanisms. Exploiting a lottery in assessment, a causal mediation analysis shows the overall positive peer effect reflects a positive effect on application behavior (conditional on GPA). When considering income mobility, we find that further mixing between high school elite and non-elite students could improve mobility. (JEL D31, I21, I23, I24, J31, J62, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For whom has earnings risk changed, and why? We answer these questions by combining the Kalman filter and EM algorithm to estimate persistent and temporary earnings for every individual at every point in time. We apply our method to administrative earnings linked with survey data. We show that since the 1980s, persistent earnings risk rose by 12.5 percent for both employed and unemployed workers and the scarring effects of unemployment doubled. At the same time, temporary earnings risk declined. Using education and occupation codes, we show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. (JEL J22, J24, J31, J64)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals might experience negative utility from not consuming a popular product. With such externalities to nonusers, standard consumer surplus measures, which take aggregate consumption as given, fail to appropriately capture consumer welfare. We propose an approach to account for these externalities and apply it to estimate consumer welfare from two social media platforms: TikTok and Instagram. Incentivized experiments with college students indicate positive welfare based on the standard measure but negative welfare when accounting for these nonuser externalities. Our findings high-light the existence of product market traps, where active users of a platform prefer it not to exist. (JEL D62, D83, D91, L82, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies housing vouchers and urban redevelopment programs by incorporating neighborhood effects into a general equilibrium overlapping-generations model with endogenous location choice and child development. We calibrate the model using US data and estimate impacts of large-scale implementations of rental voucher and place-based subsidy policies. Our core finding is that vouchers generate long-run welfare gains by reducing inequality and generating skill improvements that offset higher taxation and other GE effects. Although vouchers lead to larger welfare gains on average, we find housing supply. (JEL D63, H24, J13, J24, R23, R31, R38)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study multidistrict legislative elections with two parties and two binary dimensions of policy. Strategic voters focus on the dimension where their district is most likely to be pivotal in the legislature. Anticipating this, candidates select different policies than they would in single-district elections. The final policy is (i) uniquely pinned down by voter preferences, (ii) preferred by a majority of districts on each dimension, and (iii) a Condorcet winner if one exists. These properties are not guaranteed in single-district elections. (JEL D71, D72, D81, D91)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine political affiliation's role in venture team formation and success. Using data from Crunchbase and L2 on 1125 US‐based startups, we investigate political homophily in team assembly and its association with startup outcomes. Our analysis reveals strong political homogeneity in founding teams: teams with similar political views form more frequently than diverse teams, even after controlling for founders' gender, age, location, and industry. This political homophily relates to venture performance. Startups with politically heterogeneous founding teams are more likely to shut down. Across additional performance measures (capital funding, employee size, Crunchbase rankings), we observe directionally consistent associations with worse outcomes, though these secondary findings vary in robustness. These findings highlight the dual role of founders' political affiliations: their relationship with team composition and startup performance.Managerial SummaryOur study examines political diversity's association with startup team formation and venture success. Analyzing data from 1125 US‐based startups, we discovered a strong tendency for teams to form based on political similarity. Individuals with similar political views prefer starting companies together, even when accounting for age, gender, location, and industry. Startups with politically diverse founding teams are more likely to shut down. These teams also tend to receive less funding, have fewer employees, and exhibit worse Crunchbase rankings, although these patterns are less consistent than the survival effect. For entrepreneurs and investors, these findings highlight the need to balance team cohesion against diverse perspectives. Business practitioners should be aware of these dynamics when forming teams or developing management strategies, particularly in a politically charged environment.</content>

    <title>Marginal Returns to Public Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the returns to enrolling in American public universities by comparing the long-term outcomes of barely admitted versus barely rejected applicants. I use administrative admission records spanning all 35 public universities in Texas, which collectively enroll 10 percent of all American public university students, to systematically identify and employ decentralized cutoffs in SAT/ACT scores that generate discontinuities in admission and enrollment. The typical marginally admitted student gains an additional year of education in the four-year sector, becomes 12 percentage points more likely to ever earn a bachelor’s degree, and eventually earns 8 percent more than their marginally rejected but otherwise identical counterpart. Marginally admitted students pay no additional tuition costs thanks to offsetting grant aid; cost-benefit calculations show internal rates of return of 26 percent for the marginal students themselves, 16 percent for society (which must pay for the additional education), and 7 percent for the government budget. Earnings gains are similar across admitting institutions of varying selectivity, but smaller for students from low-income families, who spend more time enrolled but complete fewer degrees and major in less lucrative fields. Finally, I develop a method to separately identify effects for students on the extensive margin of attending any university versus those on the margin of attending a more selective one, revealing larger effects on the extensive margin.</content>

    <title>Who’s Afraid of the Minimum Wage? Measuring the Impacts on Independent Businesses Using Matched U.S. Tax Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common concern surrounding minimum wage policies is their impact on independent businesses, which are often feared to be less able to bear or pass on cost increases. We examine how these typically small- and medium-size firms accommodate minimum wage increases along product and labor market margins using a matched owner-firm-worker panel dataset drawn from the universe of U.S. tax records over a 10-year period, and using state minimum wage changes as identifying variation. We find that, on average, firms in highly exposed industries do not substantially reduce employment — they do not layoff workers but moderately reduce part-time hiring. Instead, these firms are able to fully finance the new labor costs with new revenues, leaving average owner profits unchanged. Higher wage floors, however, forestall entry, particularly of less productive firms, reducing the number of independent firms operating in these industries by roughly 2%. Yet, these industries do not shrink; instead, incumbent responses and strong positive selection among entrants reshape industries that rely heavily on low-wage workers, yielding fewer but more productive firms after the cost shock. We also take a worker-level perspective to examine how potentially vulnerable individuals are affected by minimum wage increases. Using panels of low-earning and young workers, we find that their average earnings rise substantially with the minimum wage, while they are no less likely to be employed. Worker transitions indicate that minimum wage increases boost retention and that worker reallocation from independent firms toward corporations buffers disemployment impacts from reduced hiring at independent firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rethinking Causal Inference Through Robust Sensitivity ModelsIn this issue, a new study by researchers from The Wharton School and New York University introduces a breakthrough in causal inference for observational data. Traditional analyses often fail when hidden confounders distort cause-and-effect relationships, but the newly proposed f-sensitivity model tackles this challenge by measuring the “average” impact of unobserved confounding instead of its worst-case effect. This framework connects causal inference to distributionally robust optimization, providing more realistic and interpretable bounds on treatment effects. With novel estimation and debiasing techniques, the method achieves statistical validity, even under minimal assumptions. The approach offers a flexible, computationally efficient way to test how robust conclusions remain in the presence of uncertainty, marking a significant advance in data-driven decision making across economics, healthcare, and policy analysis.</content>

    <title>Public Signals, Default Risk, and Voluntary Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the information in public signals (e.g., earnings, analysts’ forecasts) affects firms’ voluntary disclosures. We consider levered firms and information structures such that investors update their beliefs about both the mean and variance of the firm’s cash flows. We predict that firms that, conditional on the public signal, have a higher default risk are less likely to disclose. For firms with low ex ante default risk, larger positive surprises following the public signal initially increase the disclosure likelihood because they indicate a higher mean of cash flows. However, too large positive surprises may reduce the disclosure likelihood of these firms, because the larger surprise is also indicative of higher variance and, thus, higher probability of default. Symmetrically, larger negative surprises may increase disclosure for firms with high ex ante default risk, despite the more pessimistic inference about the mean, because the higher variance makes it more likely that these firms avoid default. Extending our analysis to multiple analysts’ forecasts, we predict that not only consensus, but also dispersion affect firms’ disclosure likelihood. Consensus conveys information about the mean and variance of cash flows, whereas dispersion is informative about the precision of analysts’ signals, which in turn affects the information content of forecasts.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: D.

    <title>Commercializing the Package Flow: Cross-Sampling Physical Products Through E-Commerce Warehouses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many e-commerce platforms have established their warehouses to facilitate the storage and delivery of packages. This paper studies a novel business practice—cross-sampling through e-commerce warehouses—that allows physical free samples provided by one (sampling) brand to be distributed with the packages of another unrelated (distributing) brand. In close collaboration with Alibaba, we implement cross-sampling through a large-scale field experiment, in which more than 55,000 free samples are distributed, to empirically examine its effectiveness in driving online sales of the sampling brand. First, we find significant increases in store visits and sales of the sampling brand both in the short term and long term up to 14 months afterward. The long-term effect is driven mainly by acquiring customers who did not purchase from the sampling brand to visit the online stores and eventually make a purchase. Second, contrary to the previous literature on within-category free sampling, we find a significant sales increase in both the sampled item and other items, which further spills over to indirect channels. Therefore, cross-sampling can also help promote the sampling brand as a whole. Finally, we illustrate the potential for personalization for cross-sampling. Cross-sampling is more effective for customers who recently viewed related products or just purchased nonessential products from the distributing brand. By taking into account the interaction among brands, items, and customers, we can further improve the profitability of cross-sampling by targeting the “right” packages. Overall, because cross-sampling is scalable, effective, and flexible, we demonstrate the high potential of a new business practice that combines offline logistics control and online information to generate additional business value for customers, brands, and the platform.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Funding: T.

    <title>How the Threat of Knowledge Loss Drives Firms’ R&amp;amp;D Dynamism: A Threat Rigidity Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on threat rigidity theory, this paper argues that the threat of knowledge loss gives rise to a threat rigidity effect in firms’ R&amp;D function, that is, reduces their R&amp;D dynamism. It further argues that the dampening of R&amp;D dynamism is greater for firms more vulnerable to the threat of knowledge loss due to facing greater product market competition, yet lower for firms that can better respond to the threat due to having relatively higher absorptive capacity and/or greater financial slack. Using a sample of publicly listed US manufacturing firms tracked over a 15‐year observation period from 1991 to 2015 and leveraging the quasi‐natural experiment created by the staggered rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) across fourteen US states, it empirically tests and finds support for the above hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Inventor Rewards, Specialization, and Innovation Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inventor rewards—monetary compensation for employees who generate patents—are widely used to promote innovation. Yet the same incentives can steer innovation toward productivity (quantity) or toward inventiveness (quality). Based on social identity theorizing, we argue that inventors’ social identity order—lower versus higher—explains this heterogeneity. Lower-order identities, exemplified by technological specialists, are tightly constructed around exclusive, proximal membership with actively policed expectations—such as strict inventiveness norms—whereas higher-order identities, exemplified by generalists, are more distal and loosely policed, providing limited social constraints on behavior. Rewards activate identity, and the desire for incentive-identity alignment then guides behavior, with stronger pressures to conform to ingroup standards under lower-order than higher-order identities. Hence, we predict that, in response to inventor rewards, specialists produce fewer but more-inventive patents whereas generalists increase productivity at the expense of inventiveness, defaulting to prototypical reward-maximizing behavior. Further, in mixed-identity teams, specialists’ norms are projected onto generalists, raising their inventiveness in response to inventor rewards. We test these predictions using a difference-in-differences estimation and matched inventor-patent data from before and after a regulatory change in China mandating inventor rewards in state-owned enterprises. Consistent with our theory, after the mandate, generalists filed more but less-inventive patents, specialists produced fewer but more-inventive patents, and generalists in mixed teams became more inventive. By linking social identity order to reward responses, we clarify how to align incentives and the R&amp;D workforce with desired innovation outcomes.</content>

    <title>Changing beliefs or changing behavior? Understanding the belief‐to‐behavior process and intervening to curb the impact of misinformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common assumption among scientists, journalists, and policymakers is that combating misinformation reliably changes behavior. However, the empirical evidence reveals that the belief–behavior association is often modest, variable, and context‐dependent, raising critical questions about when and how to pursue belief versus behavior change. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms by which beliefs influence behavior and the conditions under which addressing beliefs can change behavior. Specifically, we review the belief‐to‐behavior inference model, which proposes that beliefs influence behavior when (a) the belief is linked to a behavioral goal, (b) the inferential path from belief to behavior is relatively short, and (c) the belief–behavior association is preserved in memory. Our framework aligns intervention decisions with the cognitive architecture of belief–behavior correspondence and the intervention's goals, whether maximizing belief accuracy or behavioral impact. We also reviewed individual and social‐structural interventions that are best suited for changing beliefs versus behavior, conceptually integrating interdisciplinary work on behavior change with the psychology of belief change.</content>

    <title>The Effects of the FTC Policy and Affiliation Disclosures on Product Review Video Engagement: Evidence from YouTube</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractAffiliate marketing on social media involves content creators posting product reviews with affiliate links, through which they earn a commission from resulting purchases. The FTC’s disclosure guidelines require creators to reveal affiliate relationships alongside product reviews. This paper examines how the FTC policy affects viewer engagement with affiliated content, defined as product review videos containing affiliate links. We find that after the FTC policy implementation, viewer engagement with affiliated content significantly decreases relative to nonaffiliated content. However, affiliation disclosure moderates this effect: after the policy, affiliated content with disclosures receives higher engagement than affiliated content without disclosures. The mitigating effect of disclosures varies across content creator and video characteristics. The mitigating effect is more pronounced for more experienced creators, more popular creators, and more negative videos. This paper provides important empirical evidence on disclosure policies’ effects on viewer engagement, addressing a notable gap in the literature. Our findings also have important implications for policymakers designing effective disclosure regulations, content creators managing compliance while maintaining viewer engagement, and social media platforms implementing disclosure features. This paper finds that whereas disclosure policies may lower engagement with affiliated content, proper disclosures can signal credibility and increase engagement.</content>

    <title>Expanding Our Understanding of Quiet Quitting: Antecedents, Correlates, and Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting remains an undertheorized and inconsistently defined construct in the scholarly literature. There is little understanding of or agreement about its construct domain, and no unifying conceptual framework to distinguish it from related constructs. Popular accounts often equate quiet quitting with employee work disengagement. Drawing on a synthesis of academic and practitioner literatures, we conceptualized quiet quitting as a form of psychological withdrawal that extends beyond in‐role task disengagement to include disengagement from colleagues and the organization more broadly. Its key components include a weakening of social connections at work, diminishing job engagement, a generalized disinclination toward work, and the desire to set boundaries between work and personal life. To reflect this multifaceted conceptualization, we developed the Multidimensional Quiet Quitting (MQQ) scale, comprising four interrelated dimensions: (1) lack of job‐specific engagement, (2) lack of generalized work engagement, (3) lack of social connections at work, and (4) boundary setting. Using a content validation sample of working adults (N= 114), we evaluated the scale's content validity. We then examined its latent structure and internal consistency using experience sampling data from 124 professionals over 10 weeks, followed by confirmatory factor analysis in an independent replication sample (N= 290). Finally, we mapped the nomological network of quiet quitting by examining associations with theoretically relevant antecedents and outcomes. Results indicated that organizational newcomers and younger employees were slightly more prone to quiet quitting, while job autonomy, work responsibility, marriage, and childcare responsibilities served as protective factors. Quiet quitters also tended to be less extraverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, and agreeable. Quiet quitting and disengagement were each associated with concurrent and subsequent mental health and work outcomes. Quiet quitting components incrementally predicted stress, job satisfaction, burnout, and work effectiveness beyond traditional work disengagement, an overlapping construct. By specifying and measuring quiet quitting as a multidimensional construct, this study provides much‐needed construct clarity and demonstrates empirical effects associated with the phenomenon. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Management of Self-Renewable Resource in a Production-Inventory System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a production-inventory system in which production relies on a self-renewable natural resource. The resource regenerates at a rate that depends on its current stock as well as random environmental factors. In each period, the firm decides on the production quantity, facing stochastic demand and limited resource. This type of system is common in industries such as fishing and logging. We model the resource’s self-renewal using a generating function and formulate the production optimization problem as a dynamic program. We find that because of the renewable nature of the resource, the optimal stock level does not necessarily increase with the available resource quantity, and could become higher than the optimal stock level for a benchmark system where resource is unlimited. In a special case with deterministic demand and environment, we show that it could be optimal to halt production even with zero inventory left, in order to preserve the growth of resource. On the other hand, it could also be optimal to raise the inventory level to be higher than demand, when overpopulation becomes an issue. Moreover, a higher market price, which stems from adverse environmental conditions and signals lower future yields, can incentivize the firm to reduce production and conserve resources for future growth. In a deterministic environment where the inventory is fully perishable, we analytically characterize the long-run dynamics of the resource quantity. In particular, sustainable production is more achievable for low-margin products, and a myopic production firm does not necessarily deplete the resource. We conduct numerical experiments using real-world salmon population data to test the robustness of our findings in general systems with stochastic environment and non-perishable products. The results show that ignoring either the resource constraint or the self-renewal dynamics, could lead to high operational costs and undermine resource sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Returning products has become standard practice for consumers, and a significant "pain point" for retailers. The authors contend that returns can be harnessed to increase profits. This requires retailers to manage the interweaving dynamics of product returns and purchase. The strategy is to co-manage a virtuous cycle whereby current returns increase future purchases, and a vicious cycle whereby current returns increase future returns. Marketing executes the strategy. It generates purchases. The returns that follow impose a direct cost due to the vicious cycle. However, the virtuous cycle of returns can offset this, enabling the retailer to “free-ride” returns by optimizing its marketing. The approach follows the Decision Support System (DSS) paradigm by combining a conceptual model, a statistical model, data, and optimization. A core construct is a stock variable tracking consumers’ memory of return experiences. This drives both the virtuous and vicious cycles. The authors optimize marketing spend accounting for Return Stock. The best results are when dynamics are included in both the statistical and optimization models. Results suggests managers should avoid strict return policies aimed at eliminating returns. Instead, they should design policies that optimally balance the long-term benefits and costs of returns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how an incumbent firm navigates internal and external uncertainties when entering a nascent platform ecosystem. Drawing on a longitudinal study of a large telecommunication firm's transition into an evolving IoT ecosystem, we advance a cognitive perspective on platform strategy. We explain how managers' cognitive frames shape platform scope decisions based on shifting assumptions and interpretations of ecosystem dynamics and internal capabilities. Our process model shows how deviations between expected and actual developments trigger changes in managers' attitudes toward uncertainty, thereby shifting their cognitive frames and prompting them to modify platform scope strategies, leading to oscillation between shaping and adapting strategic postures. Our theorization sheds light on the cognitive foundations of platform strategy and the dynamics of incumbent platform transitions in a nascent ecosystem.Managerial SummaryIncumbents often enter nascent digital ecosystems by introducing a platform, yet uncertainty complicates decisions about the appropriate platform scope. Our nine‐year study of TELECO’s IoT platform reveals three takeaways. First, scope is not a one‐off decision; it evolves as managers revisit assumptions about opportunities and constraints. Second, scope decision rarely move linearly; firms oscillate between broad and calibrated scopes, creating episodes of overreach and retrenchment. Third, interpretations of uncertainty steer these shifts: reading uncertainty as an opportunity supports shaping bets, whereas interpreting it as a constraint encourages adaptation and selective coopetition. Overall, platform decisions in uncertain ecosystems reflect organizational tensions as firms balance ambitions for dominance against market realities and the actions of ecosystem members.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the importance of production networks for the transmission of monetary policy using the stock market reaction as laboratory. We attribute 55% to 85% of the overall response to network effects. Large network effects are a robust feature of the data; we document similar patterns in realized fundamentals. Matching sparsity and the first two outdegrees industry-by-industry can explain large network effects. A simple model with intermediate inputs predicts the reaction of stock returns follows a spatial autoregression, which we exploit for our empirical strategy. Our results suggest production networks are an important mechanism for transmitting monetary policy shocks. (JEL E12, E31, E44, E52, G12, G14)</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing Strategies for Processing Intermediaries in Agri-chains with Side Markets: Paradox of Ex-Post Pricing Flexibility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study an agricultural supply chain in an emerging economy, where farmers make land allocation decisions among alternative crops and have the option to sell their harvest either in a side market or directly to a processing plant, and where a government-mandated minimum price guarantee (MPG) is in place. Our study examines a range of pricing strategies that the processing plant can employ to favor a protected crop and the utilization of the processing plant. We begin by considering the Benchmark strategy, in which the plant strictly adheres to the MPG. Subsequently, we investigate two distinct pricing strategies: the Ex-ante strategy, in which the plant commits to an optimal predetermined final price at the start of the growing season; and the Responsive strategy, in which the optimal final price is determined at the end of the season after yield and side-market uncertainties have been resolved. Additionally, we propose the Hybrid strategy, which integrates both ex-ante pricing as a preseason commitment and ex-post price adjustments in response to realized uncertainties. We develop two-stage stochastic program models to analyze the farmer allocation and plant pricing decisions. Among other results, our study suggests that the ex-post pricing flexibility inherent in the Responsive approach may leave the plant worse off, even though price adjustments are plant-profit optimizing. We refer to this phenomenon as the ex-post pricing flexibility paradox. Due to this phenomenon, the Hybrid strategy, while consistently outperforming the Responsive approach, does not always dominate the Ex-ante approach. We propose execution variants of the Hybrid strategy that can guarantee outperformance on the Ex-ante benchmark. In long-term repeated interactions between the plant and farmers, the Hybrid strategy with historically credible probabilistic afterharvest price adjustments, proves effective. For short-term practices, defining a contingency region of relevant outcomes (e.g., yield realizations, side-market attractiveness, and processing margins) that triggers after-harvest price adjustments enables the Hybrid strategy to outperform. These findings urge caution when the plant considers adjusting after-harvest prices, and highlight the importance of building long-term and stable relationships in agri-chains for effective execution of pricing strategies that align incentives and optimize profits for all involved parties.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Expanding Naloxone Accessibility: A Lifesaver or a Risky Setback?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The widespread prevalence of opioids has prompted governments to implement targeted interventions aimed at reducing overdose mortality, with naloxone accessibility emerging as one of the most prominent policies. Naloxone, a potent opioid antagonist, is highly effective in reversing overdoses, yet its expanded availability introduces complex trade-offs, particularly in the presence of moral hazard.We develop a dynamic compartmental model that captures transitions between susceptible individuals and those with opioid use disorder (OUD), allowing us to evaluate the impact of naloxone accessibility on overdose mortality and to derive the optimal accessibility policy. We show that full naloxone accessibility is optimal in the absence of moral hazard or when its effect is small. However, when moral hazard is significant—where greater access to naloxone encourages riskier opioid use—expanded accessibility can paradoxically increase overdose deaths.Extending the model to incorporate peer-driven contagion in opioid misuse, we find that the structure of the optimal policy remains robust, preserving the bang-bang nature and the reversal induced by moral hazard. Two additional insights emerge under this interaction-based model. First, in epidemics primarily driven by prescription-induced opioid use, full accessibility remains optimal. In contrast, when opioid use spreads socially—especially as the effectiveness of naloxone declines due to potent synthetic opioids like carfentanil—limited accessibility may become preferable. Second, the relationship between naloxone accessibility and overdose mortality may become non-monotonic, exhibiting an inverted U-shape in which moderate increases in accessibility can initially worsen outcomes.A calibrated case study based on U.S. data suggests that under current epidemic conditions, full accessibility remains optimal—a finding that aligns with existing regulatory policies. However, our results highlight that shifts in epidemic dynamics, such as increased opioid potency, may fundamentally alter this conclusion. These findings underscore the need for continuous reevaluation of naloxone distribution policies as the opioid crisis evolves.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While sports are enjoyed by several billion fans globally, the business of sports has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry. Multi-disciplinary research on developing competitive strategies for drafting players and making on-field decisions is growing rapidly. However, there remains a notable gap in operations management research focusing on thebusiness aspectsof the sports industry. This paper addresses this gap in the literature to encourage future research in this domain. We highlight new opportunities for operations management researchers, emphasizing five research themes that are of importance to the sports industry: (1) revenue management, (2) new technologies in sports business, (3) betting, (4) rule and competition changes, and (5) service operations. We identify important and relevant open-ended research questions and discuss related trade-offs to address the research questions. This paper provides a basis for future operations management research to address the unique challenges faced by sports organizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The long drug approval process in the US imposes significant development costs on firms and delays access for patients, especially when a therapy that addresses a condition with no existing treatments shows early promise. To shorten approval timelines, the FDA has instituted expedited pathways that are designed to bring the most promising therapies to patients more quickly. In this paper, we study the safety implications of the newest of the four expedited pathways: the Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) program. We also examine the effectiveness of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) and the Boxed Warnings (BW) – two pharmacovigilance tools that the FDA uses to mitigate the safety risks. To conduct our study, we compile a unique dataset of 327 drugs approved by the FDA between 2012 and 2019. We measure drug safety as the number of serious adverse events associated with a drug in a year. Results from the instrumental variable analysis show that BTD drugs incur 1,722 additional serious adverse events in a year (equivalent to 2.7 times the average annual serious adverse events) compared to non-BTD drugs. We find that REMS substantially reduces this safety gap, but BW does not. Specifically, BTD drugs with REMS record 875 fewer serious adverse events per year than BTD drugs without REMS. By revealing the BTD program’s detrimental effects on drug safety and showing which pharmacovigilance tools effectively mitigate these hazards, we contribute to quality and new product development literatures, and provide actionable guidance to policymakers. We propose that the FDA should consider requiring REMS for all drugs approved with BTD status.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Under what conditions should traditional firms transform into digital platforms? While adding developers can enhance value through externalizing value creation, it also entails investment risk. We show that when transformation entails high risk and the value of network effects is low, firms should avoid transforming into a platform and retain their traditional form. By contrast, low transformation risk or high value of network effects make digital transformation profitable. Interestingly, when firms choose to transform, we show that inviting rivals onto the platform can raise profits. Indeed, the platform can even pay rivals to join its platform in certain cases. We find that the benefit of enhancing network effects through demand aggregation can be more profitable than competing as separate platforms. Further, inviting rivals onto a proprietary platform lowers the rival’s competitive aggressiveness. This is a novel strategic rationale for inviting rivals onto the platform elicited in this paper. Yet, when the value of network effects is very high and investments are nearly certain, the platform chooses to foreclose rivals’ participation. We offer guidelines for managers seeking to transform and for regulators seeking to intervene to boost market efficiency. We use real-world examples to illustrate our theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A developer's popularity plays a crucial role in their success within open source software (OSS) communities and their access to sponsorship opportunities. This study, seeks to answer the question - which signals have the most predictive power for popularity and sponsorship volume on social coding platforms? Using algorithm supported abductive theory generation supplemented by qualitative insights from observations and interviews, we arrive at a theory of peer evaluation in OSS communities. We examine a large number of signals and categorise them. The two categories are signalling via self-disclosure through profile signals and signalling via contribution quantity and quality through behavioral signals. The large amount of data available to us allows us to use machine learning techniques to arrive at top ranking predictors within each category. We generate our theory by finding robust patterns and test our theory using a hold-out sample. Our findings indicate that easily observable credibility enhancing, and approachability related developer profile signals hold greater predictive importance in shaping popularity. However, harder to observe and more complex behavioral signals show greater predictive importance for sponsorship volume. These results signify OSS social coding platforms are not meritocratic, as developer self-disclosure significantly influences popularity. In contrast, sponsorship decisions, due to their high cost and irreversibility, depend on within platform contribution-related signals. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of popularity and sponsorship within peer-to-peer followership networks in OSS communities. Through our research, platforms are better informed about the predictors of popularity and sponsorship and can introduce measures to enhance the meritocratic nature of these communities. Developers who seek influence and sponsorship on the platform can be more strategic about information disclosure and their contributions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide firm-level evidence on how politicians’ ideologies shape economic outcomes, using a unique setting of ideological discontinuity in China, transitioning from Maoism to Dengism around 1978. We find that ideological exposure during a politician’s early adulthood has a lasting impact on contemporary firm policies in their city. Firms governed by “Maoist mayors” show greater stakeholder spending, lower pay inequality, and less internationalization compared with those governed by “Dengist mayors.” Further evidence suggests that politicians’ ideologies influence corporate behaviors through nonpolicy channels, and these results cannot be fully explained by selection bias, endogenous matching, or the age of the mayor.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Business Research Initiative [Grant G17C20406 from SMU and CKGSB] from the Singapore Management University and the China Europe International Business School.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01745 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The pervasive use of smartphones has raised concerns about their addictive and maladaptive nature. This paper introduces an intervention based on rational addiction theory to cost-effectively nudge consumers to reduce smartphone usage, promoting sustainable digital consumption. We examine whether pre-announcing future targets to reduce smartphone usage influences current consumption and behavioral change. We develop a mathematical model incorporating habit formation, satiation, and projection bias, and test its predictions in three pre-registered randomized control trials using objectively measured smartphone usage. When future incentives and targets are pre-announced, consumers reduce usage pre-emptively compared to their baseline, consistent with rational addiction. This occurs only when participants are given fixed daily reduction targets, not when incentivized proportionally for reductions over time, and seems to reflect forward-looking habit formation, as other explanations (e.g., goal priming or capability testing) were unlikely to drive results. Interestingly, pre-emptive reductions are stronger among heavy users and those with stronger beliefs in meeting their targets. We also find that pre-emptive reductions help consumers meet their targets during the incentivized period and might support post-treatment behavioral sustenance. Our model fitting results reveal considerable heterogeneity and offer insights into how digital detox experiences can be structured to promote sustainable behavior change.</content>

    <title>Starting Positive: The Impact of Self-Presentation Concerns on Consumer Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how reviewers’ self-presentation strategies influence their posting behavior. We find reviewers are less likely to post negative reviews early in their review history due to concerns that doing so would make them appear as lacking warmth. This concern diminishes as the number of reviews associated with their profile increases, resulting in a discernable negative trend in ratings at the reviewer level. We document this trend across two well-known review platforms (Yelp and TripAdvisor). A series of controlled laboratory studies replicate the effect while demonstrating the role played by self-presentation concerns in explaining the downward trend of ratings. Specifically, we find concerns about appearing to lack warmth influence reviewers’ initial reluctance to post negative (but not positive) reviews, while concerns about appearing competent do not. We identify two theoretically consistent managerial interventions that moderate the effect. Allowing reviewers to rate experiences without associating a review with their profile reduces the effect of the number of prior reviews on their likelihood to post, as does prompting them to mention one positive element in their written comments. Our findings underscore the common concern that online review platforms provide positively skewed ratings and offers insight into how to address this.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers often act to correct the wrongdoings of people close to them, such as family members or friends. The current research demonstrates that consumers may also engage in a variety of reparatory behaviors—from a simple apology to gift‐giving and tipping—to counter the misdeeds of in‐group strangers when their behavior threatens the reputation of their shared group identity. Across eight preregistered experiments, the present research demonstrates that when an in‐group member commits a wrongdoing in the presence of out‐group observers, fellow in‐group members experience a threat to the group's reputation. This reputational threat evokes feelings of embarrassment and a motivation to distance the group identity from the transgressor, prompting reparatory behaviors such as apologizing, gift‐giving, or tipping. These effects emerge across a range of social identities, including ethnicity, nationality, university affiliation, and sports team fandom. Importantly, this tendency is attenuated when other in‐group members have already taken action to restore the group's image. These findings reveal a powerful form of identity‐driven consumer behavior, highlighting how concerns about group reputation can drive individuals to act, even for the misdeeds of in‐group strangers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To meet sales targets with limited resources, business-to-business (B2B) service firms must prioritize promising opportunities within large pipelines. Yet, both theory and practice indicate that such decisions often rely on intuition or ad hoc rules, resulting in suboptimal sales and operations planning. Drawing on relationship management and organizational buying literature, we develop a theory-informed sales-operations framework that links buyer typology (e.g., new vs. rebid) and opportunity characteristics (e.g., size, relationship strength) to the firm’s bid and win decisions. Using archival data from a global on-site services provider encompassing 4,574 opportunities across 23 countries (2010–2021), we document a persistent trade-off: while low-risk, relationship-based opportunities yield higher win probabilities, they are insufficient to achieve regional sales goals. We address this challenge through an ensemble machine learning model that predicts win likelihood and a combinatorial optimization model that allocates bidding capacity strategically. The integrated framework improves predictive accuracy by 11% and could have increased realized sales by 21% while bidding on 38% fewer opportunities. Extensions incorporating stochastic programming and a Heckman-style two-stage correction enhance the framework’s robustness to uncertainty and data selection bias, providing managers with a rigorous, data-driven approach to opportunity management.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Does Artificial Intelligence Stimulate or Diminish Human Interactions? An Affordance Perspective on AI, Relational Coordination, and Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) can influence the way people relate and coordinate to improve performance. Our research explores how human-AI interactions affect relational coordination and operational performance. Competing views suggest that AI may augment or substitute for human capabilities. To examine conflicting views, we build on affordance theory, which suggests that the interactions between people and technology provide (i.e., afford) multiple potential actions, which could stimulate or diminish human interactions. Given the importance of human interactions during times of increasing technology use, we focus on relational coordination with its explicit emphasis on human relationships built on mutual respect and shared goals in fostering coordination. We introduce and find evidence of the concepts of convergent and divergent affordances to explain how AI affordances can result in similar or different outcomes. We perform multiple progressive, behavioral experiments in a virtual factory setting where participants work in teams with three functional roles, including operations, demand, and quality. We randomly assign individuals to one of three treatment groups that differ in the number of teammates that receive recommendations from an analytical AI based on machine learning. Through quantitative, qualitative, replication, recording, and multiphase methods, we find that human-AI interactions can stimulate relational coordination between individuals and improve team performance. We propose a theoretical framework, the ACT cycle, that explains how people interact with AI and with one another based on discussion, trust, and use of AI. Through recording and observing teams, we find evidence of various paths of interaction in that framework. We also find that discussion of AI can stimulate relational coordination, particularly in early phases of team interactions. The results provide theoretical and practical insights into how AI can stimulate relational benefits of human-technology interactions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social purpose lies at the heart of nonprofit organizations, serving as a nexus that motivates support from volunteers, donors, and other stakeholders, driving collective efforts to address social issues and anchoring everyday practices in moral imperatives that transcend organizational boundaries. Whereas a compelling social purpose is seen as vital for the survival and growth of nonprofits, we know surprisingly little about how purpose develops in these organizations. Drawing on a triadic framework that conceptualizes social purpose as narratives, shared understandings, and enactment in practice, we investigate how purpose forms and evolves within a nonprofit organization. Our findings elaborate how discrepancies can emerge between founders’ abstract, future-oriented visions and members’ practices related to the organization’s beneficiaries. These discrepancies may lead to conflicting or fragmented understandings of purpose, but they can also be generative, driving its evolution toward a resonant and achievable social impact. Whereas leaders are commonly seen as guarding organizational purpose from drift, our study shows how members in nonprofits protect purpose from irrelevance and inefficacy.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Council of Finland.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17213 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fixing AI’s “Peer Review Lottery”Getting a paper into a top AI conference can feel like a lottery, with studies showing reviewer scores are often arbitrary. Now, research from Weijie Su introduces a fix set to reform the field. The new "isotonic mechanism" tackles the crisis by asking authors to do the seemingly counter-intuitive: rank their own submissions from best to worst. The method’s effectiveness lies in its game-theoretic proof that honesty is actually the author’s best possible strategy. By harnessing this truthful self-assessment, the mechanism calibrates noisy and random reviewer scores, ensuring genuine scientific merit rises to the top. After successful large-scale experiments at major conferences, this mechanism isn’t just a theory. It’s being officially adopted by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) in 2026, promising a fairer, more reliable future for millions of AI researchers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers are increasingly supporting businesses and brands that align closely with their values, engaging in acts of political consumerism. Despite the growing demand to support minority-owned businesses, discovering these establishments through traditional channels remains challenging. In this study, we examine whether and how online reviews facilitate the discovery of Black-owned businesses. We leverage GPS-enabled foot traffic data, hand-collected data from a directory of Black-owned restaurants, online reviews from Yelp.com, and zip code-level demographic data to understand the potential mechanisms driving this behavior. Our results suggest that Black-owned restaurants receiving reviews mentioning Black ownership as a product attribute experience about a 10% increase in foot traffic compared with those that do not receive such reviews. Furthermore, we find that reviews mentioning Black ownership primarily benefit Black-owned restaurants located in cities with lower segregation and racial isolation and those where minority ownership is not easily inferable from the kind of cuisine served. Our findings also indicate that online reviews mentioning Black ownership increase foot traffic to Black-owned restaurants by enhancing interracial exposure. Non-White consumers who patronize these restaurants experience an increased likelihood of encountering White consumers after the restaurants receive a review mentioning Black ownership. Collectively, our results demonstrate the value of user-generated content in enabling political consumerism, even without targeted interventions from digital platforms or voluntary disclosure of race by business owners.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Board Fiduciary Duty, Communication, and Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the consequences of tightening board fiduciary duty rules in a setting that combines agency frictions and strategic communication. A firm needs to tailor an investment decision (e.g., mergers and acquisitions) to the state of the world. The CEO is privately informed about the state but is an empire builder. The board can learn about the firm’s state through exerting a costly information gathering effort or through communication. In equilibrium, the board values communication more than the shareholders do. By granting the CEO a larger equity stake, the board fosters communication, and this reduces its need for costly information acquisition. Anticipating this, rational shareholders can adjust the board’s equity stake to boost its effort incentive. Surprisingly, the benefit to shareholders from stricter fiduciary duty rules is nonmonotonic in CEO agency conflicts and can diminish as the severity of agency conflict increases. Moreover, welfare analysis shows that strengthening fiduciary duty rules can weaken board effort incentives and reduce total equity value and overall welfare. Paradoxically, these efficiency losses occur when CEO agency conflicts are severe—the very situations in which stringent fiduciary duty rules are typically introduced to address such concerns. These findings suggest unintended consequences of strengthening board fiduciary duty rules and highlight the importance of taking boards as strategic, self-interested entities.This paper was accepted by Prof. Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technological advancements enable firms to anticipate service failures and apologize to consumers more effectively than ever. But are apologies always the best policy? Five experiments, including a large-scale field experiment, demonstrate that apologies backfire when consumers are not aware of the failure. Apologies decrease consumer satisfaction, trust, recommendation intentions, and repatronage behavior. This is because apologies increase awareness that a failure occurred. Accordingly, apologies backfire for both mild and severe failures so long as there is room to increase awareness of the failure. Moreover, apologies backfire more than notifications about a service failure, because although both increase awareness of the aspect of the service experience that was a failure, apologies uniquely increase awareness that this constituted a failure. Beyond increasing awareness, apologies backfire by decreasing perceived service quality and competence. However, apologies also increase perceived warmth and honesty. Consequently, apologizing can be beneficial when consumers are already aware of a failure because apologies are less likely to backfire and more likely to enhance positive perceptions of the firm. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that apologies are always the best policy when something goes wrong and provide insight into when and when not to apologize.</content>

    <title>Moving beyond the belief–behavior correlation question: Decision contexts facilitate beliefs' effects on behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Specific beliefs do not correlate with seemingly relevant behaviors for many reasons. Such correlations may be low even when beliefs perfectly cause behavior (e.g., because multiple beliefs compete for influence, because beliefs have various behavioral outlets). A belief may be a necessary precursor to, but not a guarantee of, a behavior. And most critically, belief–behavior correlations may depend on the context in which behavioral decisions are made. The present article complements Lee and Albarracín's focus on how beliefs can serve as logical premises from which behavioral intentions are deduced (belief‐to‐behavior inferences) by considering how specific contexts do or do not encourage the recruitment and potential application of beliefs. Behavioral decisions can be made entirely unprompted, because the context affords a behavioral opportunity, or because a prompt requires a decision be made. These distinctions can describe naturalistic decision making and research methodologies, suggesting details of the latter can encourage misleading conclusions about a belief's behavioral relevance. Although these considerations transcend the more specific interest in correcting misinformation, a specific concern with addressing political misinformation is discussed.</content>

    <title>Collaborative Intelligence in Sequential Experiments: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Drug Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drug discovery is a complex process that involves sequentially screening and examining a vast array of molecules to identify those with the target properties. This process faces challenges because of the vast search space, the rarity of target molecules, and constraints imposed by limited data and experimental budgets. To overcome these challenges, we propose a human-centered human–algorithm collaboration framework. Notably, both the algorithm and humans have substantial knowledge gaps. The algorithm proposes, and human experts retain decision rights to approve, revise, or override. Our design artifact leverages dual-process theory for attention management, surfaces meta-knowledge as a shared state for coordination, and optimizes a joint team objective. In real-world drug discovery tasks, the human–AI team consistently outperforms all baselines, including human-only and AI-only methods. This demonstrates complementary performance. These findings illustrate that the optimal use of AI in complex decision-making environments is to augment, rather than replace, human expertise. Managers should balance AI integration with the cultivation of deep domain expertise, ensuring that technology enhances decisions without eroding uniquely human strengths. For practice and policy: preserve human agency with clear decision rights, make model uncertainty explicit, and use AI to route scarce expert attention to the most informative experiments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine administrative data with a life cycle structural model that exploits the unique features of the U.K. mortgage market to analyze the sources of inaction and to estimate borrowers’ nonpecuniary remortgaging costs. The utility costs needed to generate a given level of inaction depend on monetary gains from remortgaging and on the importance of those monetary gains for agents, which in turn depend on the (endogenously determined) marginal utility of consumption. The model results reveal significant nonpecuniary costs of action that, when measured as a proportion of borrower income, are larger for the young and for lower-income households.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. We develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for statistical arbitrage and a novel data-driven solution. First, we construct arbitrage portfolios of similar assets as residual portfolios from conditional latent asset pricing factors. Second, we extract their time-series signals with a powerful machine learning time-series solution, a convolutional transformer. Lastly, we use these signals to form an optimal trading policy, which maximizes risk-adjusted returns under constraints. Our comprehensive empirical study on daily U.S. equities shows a high compensation for arbitrageurs to enforce the law of one price. Our arbitrage strategies obtain considerable out-of-sample mean returns and Sharpe ratios, and outperform all benchmark approaches.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank MSCI for generous research support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We uncover a significant friction in small business lending: perception of risk by Small Business Administration (SBA) employees. Using novel data on SBA employees transferring across offices, we find that more current defaults on SBA loans in their previous location reduce SBA loans and job creation in their current location. The effect is independent of local economic conditions and the informational content of the nonlocal defaults, suggesting that SBA employees update their risk assessment irrationally. Our results are the first to document that regulators’ misperception of economic conditions affects the ability of small businesses to obtain access to finance.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03040 .</content>

    <title>Correlation of Rankings in Matching Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of correlation in matching markets, where multiple decision makers simultaneously face selection problems from the same pool of candidates. We propose a model in which a candidate’s priority scores across different decision makers exhibit varying levels of correlation dependent on the candidate’s sociodemographic group. Such differential correlation can arise in school choice because of the varying prevalence of selection criteria, in college admissions because of test-optional policies, or because of algorithmic monoculture, that is, when decision makers rely on the same algorithms and data sets to evaluate candidates. We show that higher correlation for one of the groups generally improves the outcome for all groups, leading to higher efficiency. However, students from a given group are more likely to remain unmatched as their own correlation level increases. This implies that it is advantageous to belong to a low-correlation group. Finally, we extend the tie-breaking literature to multiple priority classes and intermediate levels of correlation. Overall, our results point to differential correlation as a previously overlooked systemic source of group inequalities in school, university, and job admissions.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was partially supported by MIAI @ Grenoble Alpes [Grants ANR-19-P3IA-0003 and ANR-23-PEIA-0003], by the French National Research Agency (ANR) [Grants ANR-19-CE48-0018 and ANR-20-CE23-0007], and by the National Science Foundation [Grant DMS-1928930] and by the Alfred P.

    <title>Stakeholder Management and Resource Complementarities: Firm Performance amid Systemic Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stakeholder management plays a central role in shaping firms’ responses to systemic crises. However, existing research offers incomplete guidance, often examining it in isolation from firms’ internal resource positions and external crisis exposure. Drawing on a configurational perspective, we analyse a unique dataset of 2727 US firms during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic using fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Our findings indicate that both encompassing and minimalist stakeholder management approaches can lead to high performance, but only when aligned with firms’ financial and operational resources (i.e., slack and diversification) and their levels of crisis exposure. An encompassing approach proves most effective under high crisis exposure, as it enhances legitimacy and stakeholder coordination amid uncertainty. In contrast, low‐exposure firms can perform well through a minimalist approach, provided they possess ample financial slack to buffer against disruption. Our study advances stakeholder management research by moving beyond an either‐or perspective, identifying multiple equifinal configurations for achieving resilience. We highlight the causal complexity of firms’ crisis responses and advance a contingency‐based understanding of what works, for whom, and under what conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cronyism promotes the exchange of favors among connected parties based on relationships rather than merit, granting them undue advantages in securing opportunities and resources. This study examines the impact of cronyism on the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship. The analysis of data from 98 countries over 8 years (482 country-year observations) indicates that cronyism is negatively associated with the quantity of productive entrepreneurship, and positively associated with the prevalence of unproductive entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the results reveal that cronyism diminishes the quality of entrepreneurship productivity across countries. Interestingly, the findings suggest that a stronger rule of law exacerbates the detrimental effects of cronyism on entrepreneurship productivity. These results extend our understanding of cronyism as a crucial yet understudied informal institution with major implications for management and entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Working Daily, Paid Monthly? Effects of On-Demand Wage Access on the Financial Engagement of Low-Wage Workers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented Abstract (for Research Spotlight)Low-wage workers often face liquidity constraints, relying on costly short-term credit options such as payday loans. On-demand wage access (OWA) platforms offer a promising alternative by allowing workers to access earned wages before traditional pay cycles. This study examines whether OWA enhances financial engagement among low-wage workers and investigates the mechanisms driving these effects. Using transaction data from about 4,000 users of a U.S.-based OWA platform, we employ a difference-in-differences approach with staggered adoption to identify behavioral changes. To enrich our analysis, we supplement these data with evidence from an online experiment, a survey of OWA users, and semistructured interviews exploring psychological and contextual mechanisms. Our findings show that OWA adoption increases monthly saving frequency by 3.7%, time spent monitoring financial dashboards by 12.9%, and goal-setting activity by 1.3%. These effects are amplified in regions with lower minimum wages or limited banking access but weakened among users who frequently incur fees for instant withdrawals. We identify self-empowerment—beyond mere self-efficacy—as the key mechanism enabling a shift from reactive to proactive financial management. By demonstrating how digital affordances foster behavioral change within structural constraints, this research offers actionable insights for employers, OWA providers, and policymakers seeking to promote financial inclusion.</content>

    <title>Sustainable Work and Employment in Social Care: New Challenges, New Priorities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human Resource Management (HRM) research focused on social care is sparse. This gap is surprising given the scale of the social care workforce in many countries, its vital role in meeting the increasingly complex needs of vulnerable community groups, and the persistent challenges in recruiting and retaining staff. Framing the special issue of articles on HRM in social care, we suggest the relative neglect stems from difficulties: defining the boundaries of the social care sector; scoping its workforce; capturing the diverse range of organizational service providers; and in a crowded research space, clarifying how HRM researchers might make a distinctive scholarly and practical contribution to the literature. The six articles comprising the special issue, together with literature from HRM and related fields, are explored through the organizational, systems, and stakeholder perspectives that underpinned the original call for articles. We develop a substantive characterization of HRM in social care comprising various parts. First, systemic features of the sector, including service fragmentation and light touch state regulation, are presented as pushing social care organizations towards opportunistic, low‐cost workforce management approaches that stakeholders—particularly employees and less directly service users—often experience negatively. Second, providers, nonetheless, retain some discretion to pursue alternative management strategies, with recent policy shifts towards networked care delivery models creating opportunities for more strategic, developmental HRM approaches. Third, leadership behavior and intrinsic employee satisfaction with care work can moderate the often‐degraded employment experience, albeit within limits, suggested by the sector's ongoing recruitment and retention difficulties. Synthesizing these insights through the systems, organizational, and stakeholder themes, we present a multi‐level analytical framework for the study of HRM issues in social care. Accompanying research questions aim to support the exploration of workforce issues by policymakers, practitioners, and HRM scholars.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend the prior operations management literature on innovation by providing large-sample empirical evidence of the differential effects of customer-base concentration on two distinct outcomes of innovation: volume and radicalness. We predict a positive association between customer-base concentration and innovation volume and a negative association between customer-base concentration and innovation radicalness. Using a sample of 16,014 firm-year observations in business-to-business industries between 1976 and 2010, we find results consistent with our predictions. Furthermore, we predict and find that a firm’s product market competition and financial resource constraints moderate the relation between customer-base concentration and innovation volume (radicalness). While prior operations management research on innovation primarily focuses on the dynamics of customers across high- vs. low-end markets, we extend this literature by demonstrating that customer-base concentration influences the nature of innovation regardless of market type and providing a better understanding of how market structures drive innovation outcomes. Firms with high customer-base concentration can use the insights from our study to allocate resources more effectively across incremental and radical innovations with the objective of ensuring their long-term survival and development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As malpractice liability increases, physicians order more and more diagnostic tests/procedures to avoid potential lawsuits. Given the waste/costs of defensive medical practices, some U.S. states enacted tort reform to reduce malpractice liability. As key healthcare providers, hospitals face significant malpractice liability. Despite the fact that a vast amount of medical malpractice occurs in hospitals, the effects of tort reform on hospital performance have not been studied. This study examined tort reform’s effects on four hospital cost/efficiency related measures (defensive medicine (DM) costs, occupancy rate (OR), operating cost (OC), and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees/bed) and two patient-centered measures (experiential quality (EQ) and patient satisfaction (PS)). Considering both cost and quality measures enabled an examination of whether a trade-off arises under tort reform – a trade-off uniquely relevant at the hospital-level. The research applied difference-in-differences (DID) methodology to longitudinal data from multiple sources and addressed methodological weaknesses in prior studies preventing causal attribution. The results showed that tort reform reduced DM costs, with an average savings of $372 per patient stay and a savings of $238 million for an average-sized hospital, decreased hospitals' OC, with an average savings of $664 per patient stay and $4.23 million for an average-sized hospital and is associated with 0.22 fewer FTEs per bed. However, tort reform’s reduction in OR was not statistically significant. The findings indicate that conclusions drawn from single medical specialty studies do not necessarily translate to hospitals with a full spectrum of healthcare services. With respect to the patient-oriented measures, experiential quality and patient satisfaction fell by 3.53% and 5.63%, respectively. The study is particularly germane given the challenges hospitals face in meeting both the cost and quality mandates of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) Value-based Purchasing (VBP) program and provides valuable insights for policymakers (at both government and hospital levels) for improving hospital performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring fair platform practices has become a critical challenge in Operations Management. Increasing anecdotal evidence suggests that digital platforms may leverage consumer data to engage in data-driven price discrimination (DDPD) -- charging discriminatory prices to customers based on inferred willingness to pay. Yet, despite widespread concern, no platform has publicly acknowledged the operation of DDPD, and academic research has thus far lacked the means and empirical evidence to quantify its magnitude in practice. Against this backdrop, the first objective of this study therefore is to provide direct evidence on the presence of DDPD. To this end, we conducted a field experiment with a leading e-retailing platform in China. The results reveal that customers for whom the platform possesses more data are subject to a higher level of price discrimination. Recently, various regulations have been introduced to protect consumers from unfair use of their data, but there is a lack of evidence on platform compliance to these regulations. The second research objective is then to investigate whether and to what degree platforms complied with these regulations. We leverage a unique natural experiment in which the Chinese government implemented a new regulation banning DDPD in 2020. The findings reveal that while DDPD practice did not disappear entirely, the level decreased significantly post-regulation. As the first empirical study to present direct evidence of DDPD presence and platform compliance, the findings have significant implications for policymakers, platforms, and customers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Fan Cultivation and Monetization with Network Effects: Competing Influencers and Collaborating Brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate fan cultivation and monetization with network effects for competing influencers. Influencers are asymmetric in content-creation ability, and each influencer cooperates with a brand. They monetize their fame by charging a commission fee for selling the cooperating brand’s products to consumers. Influencers compete for fans by adjusting content quality in the fan-cultivation stage, and brands determine product prices in the monetization stage. We first study influencers maximizing only current sales profits and then incorporate long-term benefits through the word-of-mouth effect. We characterize the equilibrium of the quality-pricing game between influencers and brands and reveal how commission rates, content-creation abilities, network effect levels, and word-of-mouth strength affect influencers’ and brands’ equilibrium behavior and profits. We find that a higher revenue share of a brand does not always benefit the brand. Improving an influencer’s ability always helps the influencer-brand channel, whereas raising the commission rate may hurt the channel’s profit, depending on whether the influencer is advantaged (i.e., having a higher content-creation ability or charging a higher commission rate). From the social welfare perspective, cooperating with low-commission-rate influencers is recommended. Moreover, conducting influencer marketing with influencers who have a greater difference in content-creation ability improves social welfare. Allowing for the word-of-mouth effect, strengthening the effect improves the advantaged influencer’s content quality and may lower the disadvantaged influencer’s. Surprisingly, a stronger word-of-mouth effect may make either influencer worse off. We extend the base model by investigating a brand’s influencer cooperation strategy, cooperation with multiple influencers under a commission-and-slotting-fee (a fixed payment made to an influencer) mode, fans with correlated content preferences, and substitutable products with correlated consumer preferences sold by competing brands. These extensions confirm the robustness of the base-model findings and bring new insights. Specifically, as the network effect strengthens, the brand tends to cooperate with a more advantaged influencer. When a brand can cooperate with multiple influencers with a slotting fee, cooperating with one influencer is non-optimal when the slotting fee is low or the network effect is weak. Direct competition between correlated products may make a higher commission rate of the advantaged influencer contribute to more social welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Algorithms Advance Revenue Management with Demand LearningA new study by Sentao Miao (University of Colorado Boulder), Yining Wang (University of Texas at Dallas), and Jiawei Zhang (New York University) introduces efficient algorithms for revenue management when firms face limited resources and uncertain demand. Revenue management, used in industries such as airlines, hotels, and retail, requires dynamic decisions on pricing and product assortments, whereas resources such as seats or inventory cannot be replenished. Traditional approaches often struggle with complexity or weak theoretical guarantees. The authors propose a primal-dual learning framework that combines optimization with machine learning’s upper confidence bound method. Their approach achieves near-optimal regret bounds, remaining computationally efficient even in large or infinite decision spaces. Applications include dynamic assortment selection, network revenue management with generalized linear demand, and joint pricing–assortment optimization. Numerical experiments show the methods consistently outperform benchmarks, offering practical, scalable solutions for data-driven industries.</content>

    <title>Optimized Dimensionality Reduction for Moment-Based Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most moment-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems can be reformulated as semidefinite programming (SDP) problems, which can be solved in polynomial time. However, solving high-dimensional SDPs is often time-consuming. Existing approximation methods typically reduce the dimensionality of random parameters before solving the approximated SDPs. This sequential approach relies solely on statistical information to reduce the high-dimensional uncertainty space, which may not yield the best approximation performance. Jiang et al. (2025) introduce an optimized dimensionality reduction (ODR) approach that integrates the dimensionality reduction of random parameters with subsequent optimization problems. This integration enables two outer approximations and one inner approximation of the original problem, all represented as low-dimensional SDPs that can be solved efficiently, providing two lower bounds and one upper bound, respectively. More importantly, these approximations can theoretically achieve the optimal value of the original high-dimensional SDPs, resulting in a zero gap.</content>

    <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Equilibrium Computation in Multistage Auctions and Contests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compute equilibrium strategies in multistage games with continuous signal and action spaces as they are widely used in the management sciences and economics. Examples include sequential sales via auctions, multistage elimination contests, and Stackelberg competitions. In sequential auctions, analysts performing equilibrium analysis are required to derive not just single bids but bid functions for all possible signals or values that a bidder might have in multiple stages. Because of the continuity of the signal and action spaces, these bid functions come from an infinite dimensional space. Although such models are fundamental to game theory and its applications, equilibrium strategies are rarely known. The resulting system of nonlinear differential equations is considered intractable for all but elementary models. This has been limiting progress in game theory and is a barrier to its adoption in the field. We show that deep reinforcement learning and self-play can learn equilibrium bidding strategies for various multistage games. Verifying an equilibrium in such games is challenging because of the continuous signal and action spaces. We introduce a verification algorithm and prove that the error of this verifier decreases when considering Lipschitz continuous strategies with increasing levels of discretization and sample sizes. Leveraging the novel verification algorithm, we find equilibrium in models that have not yet been explored analytically and new asymmetric equilibrium bid functions for established models of sequential auctions.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grant BI 1057/9].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge is a key resource in marketing and an assumption across literatures is that a firm must prevent valuable knowledge from leaking to competitors. This research develops a theoretical framework that calls for rethinking this view by offering a fresh perspective onwhenandhowa firm should protect marketing knowledge to minimize the likelihood harm to the firm. This framework integrates research across disciplines and interviews with executives to provide a more accurate analysis of the payoffs of knowledge protection. This is accomplished, first, by introducing a set of unintended hidden costs of the most commonly used knowledge-protection strategy—leakage prevention—that harm a firm’s competitive advantage. Firm and industry moderators that influence the magnitude and consequences of these hidden costs are outlined. Second, the framework suggests that the benefits of knowledge protection may be more limited than previously recognized. It does so by delineating the knowledge “leakage-to-harm” process and identifying competitor and industry moderators that can impede the process. Third, the framework offers a typology of alternative protection strategies firms can use to preserve their knowledge-based competitive advantage. Across these contributions, the framework calls for substantial rethinking marketing knowledge protection with important implications for marketing practice and future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Novice art pricing is an understudied domain. Novice artists operate as microenterprises, making crucial price-setting decisions. Research shows that newcomers often risk overpricing or underpricing their work, and existing online tools offer basic, cost-based pricing advice. Using a three-study framework, we examine novice art pricing on Etsy, where artwork listings include structured data, images, and textual descriptions. We first analyze how these inputs relate to final selling prices using a hedonic regression on structured data, followed by a multimodal fusion deep learning (MMF-DL) model that integrates structured, visual, and textual features. Our results show that features related to artist authenticity (e.g., certificates), customer service (e.g., shipping, returns, personalization), and art style (e.g., genre) are important price predictors. Thus, novice art sold on online platforms exhibits some features typical of mature art markets (e.g., authenticity and reputation) but emphasize customer-focused services. Finally, using a Cox proportional hazards model, we show that, while higher artist reputation is associated with faster sales, discounting correlates with longer time on market. These associations suggest the importance of price setting. From these insights, we develop a price recommender application that predicts both selling prices and time-to-sale, offering practical guidance for newcomer artists and online platforms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Ethnic Diversity in Advertising: A Meta-Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although research on ethnic diversity in advertising is extensive, its findings remain fragmented and often inconclusive. This limits practical guidance for marketers. Beyond marketing- and consumer-specific factors, differences between ethnic minority groups within a country and cross-national socioeconomic and cultural factors can play a role in shaping responses to ethnic diversity advertising of consumers belonging to either ethnic majority or minority groups. This study develops and empirically tests a theoretical framework to examine the impact of ethnic diversity in advertising along with the factors that moderate this impact. We conduct a meta-analysis based on 1,276 effect sizes derived from 106 studies published between 1969 and 2024, encompassing 155 unique datasets from 21 countries. The findings reveal that ethnic diversity effects are small, but are moderated by country-level variables such as migration rates and rule of law, in addition to product, advertising, and consumer characteristics and that some of these moderator effects work differently for ethnic minority compared to majority consumers. Furthermore, within the U.S. context, the sociopolitical power position of ethnic minorities enhances advertising effectiveness among majority consumers. These insights offer implications for both researchers and practitioners.</content>

    <title>Stereotypes as Strategic Assets: How Expatriates Navigate Discrimination to Build Advantage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreigners are often subject to stereotyping and discrimination, challenges typically associated with negative outcomes in the literature. In contrast, this study explores the potential benefits of such experiences for expatriates. Using an abductive approach, informed by self-categorization theory and impression management theory, we draw on interviews with 102 German expatriates in China, Korea, and Japan to examine 1) the stereotyping and resulting preferential discrimination expatriates experience abroad and 2) how expatriates strategically utilize stereotypes to their advantage. Our findings reveal that both positive and negative stereotypes can lead to preferential discrimination. Expatriates may benefit from immediate trust, privileged access to decision-makers, and what is often referred to as a “foreigner bonus.” Rather than passively accepting stereotyping, expatriates actively leveraged it through three strategies—trustworthy actor, powerful messenger, cultural clueless foreigner—to gain individual and organizational benefits. These strategic performances were often encouraged by local colleagues and superiors. By uncovering how expatriates engage in stereotypical behavior to enhance outcomes, this study reframes foreignness as a valuable asset that can be performed situationally and relationally. This perspective offers valuable managerial implications and advances theoretical understanding of cross-cultural interactions.</content>

    <title>What, Why, and How: An Empiricist’s Guide to Double/Debiased Machine Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an introduction to double/debiased machine learning (DML), a framework that enables effect estimation when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data. In many empirical analyses, especially in fields such as information systems, researchers face difficult choices about which control variables to include and how to model their relationships with the outcome. These modeling decisions can significantly change results, leading to uncertainty about which findings are reliable. DML offers a practical solution by combining modern machine learning with rigorous statistical inference. The idea is to let flexible ML models (such as random forests or gradient boosting) capture complex relationships among control variables while still delivering reliable estimates for the key effect of interest. DML can be applied to many familiar research designs, including standard regression with controls, instrumental variables, difference in differences, and models that incorporate ML-generated features. Empirical studies and simulations show that DML is typically more robust to misspecification than traditional regression and more reliable than earlier semiparametric methods. However, DML is not automatic—it still requires sound research design and high-quality machine learning estimation. Used thoughtfully, DML provides a powerful, flexible, and statistically grounded approach for empirical research in modern data environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand’s dystopian work of fiction, became a cornerstone of libertarian philosophy and its influence continues as an articulation of contemporary capitalism. In introducing this Special Issue, we revisit its core assumptions and contradictions in order to reimagine capitalism and reflect on the potential of management studies to contribute alternatives. These aspirations are reflected in the contributions. They discuss Indigenous views of capitalism, the ethics of care, insights from self‐determination theory, the logic of marketization, and how capitalist institutions foster violence, racism, inequality, and environmental crisis. Building from these insights, we discuss the potential for future research to draw on a combined critical lens ofplaceandintersectionalityin developing systemic analyses of capitalism. Place situates action in its meaningful social and geographical spaces, recognizing the specific historical, political, and community relations through which global forces are (re‐)produced and experienced. Intersectionality interrogates the capitalist system through various axes of identity to understand its consequences and inequalities. We use this framing to assess key aspects of contemporary capitalism: labour markets, globalization and global value chains, and access to resources. We then reflect on the prospects for alternative imaginings of capitalism and how management research might contribute to these.</content>

    <title>Counter‐Stigmatization in the Digital Age: The Case of the Sex Tech Award Incident</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have shown considerable interest in how organizations manage stigma when powerful actors discredit them and their products. However, research has paid less attention to how organizations might deflect stigma back onto their stigmatizers. This is a distinct possibility in today’s digital age, where social evaluations are rapidly disseminated, emotionally charged, and widely distributed. We investigate this dynamic in this paper, focusing on how stigmatized organizations can counter‐stigmatize their stigmatizers despite an imbalance of power. Drawing on a longitudinal case of a sex tech start‐up whose innovation award was rescinded by a major technology trade show, we identify the triggers, mechanisms, and outcomes of counter‐stigmatization. The model that we offer contributes to research on stigmatization as a process. Specifically, we theorize how digitally mediated counter‐stigmatization reshapes power dynamics, how event and core stigma become intertwined within this process, and how emotions drive counter‐stigmatization.</content>

    <title>Are boards reluctant to remove poorly performing successors to interim CEOs?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interim CEO appointments are disruptive and costly to firms. Boards justify them as necessary to find the right permanent successor. But what happens if that successor performs poorly? This paper argues that directors may be reluctant to remove a poorly performing successor to an interim CEO early in their tenure. It posits that this may be owing to directors' concerns for their own reputations or for the firm. Results demonstrate that successors to interim CEOs are considerably less likely than successors to permanent CEOs to experience performance‐related early departures. This appears to be owing to directors' efforts to avoid further harming the firm. Additional analyses suggest these concerns may be justified, as early exits by successors to interim CEOs are associated with post‐succession market declines.Managerial SummaryWhen faced with an unexpected CEO departure, appointing an interim CEO is often viewed as a prudent decision to ensure the selection of the right permanent successor. Yet interim appointments are disruptive and can have lasting consequences. This study finds that when a permanent successor follows an interim CEO, directors appear reluctant to remove them early for poor performance. This reluctance appears to be driven primarily by directors' concerns about causing further harm to the firm rather than their concerns that removing the successor early may damage their reputations as governance professionals. Additional analyses indicate that these concerns for the well‐being of the firm may be justified, as early exits by successors to interim CEOs are associated with post‐succession declines in market performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beyond One Policy: A New Framework for Comparing Multiple InterventionsTraditional methods for policy evaluation typically focus on a single intervention. Yet many real-world settings feature multiple, often concurrent, interventions—making it crucial to understand their comparative effects. In “Synthetic Interventions: Extending Synthetic Controls to Multiple Treatments,” Agarwal, Shah, and Shen introduce the synthetic interventions framework, a generalization of the synthetic controls method that accommodates multiple treatments within a unified model. By representing outcomes as a low-rank tensor capturing relationships across time, units, and interventions, their approach enables researchers to estimate counterfactual outcomes under all interventions for each unit. The authors establish consistency of their estimator and show that a bias-corrected version achieves asymptotic normality, permitting valid statistical inference. This work offers a new perspective for evaluating complex, multipolicy environments where traditional causal inference tools fall short.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using various measures of economic uncertainty, we find that the beta-alpha anomaly exists only during periods of low economic uncertainty. We argue that diminished risk appetite during high economic uncertainty eases leverage constraints of typical long-only investors, making overvaluation of high-beta stocks and undervaluation of low-beta stocks less likely. Differences in uncertainty-related beta trading activities between mutual fund investors/managers and hedge funds support this explanation. Variation of the beta anomaly within the low-uncertainty state further corroborates it: the anomaly is significant (insignificant) in stocks heavily held by actively managed mutual funds (hedge funds), and it is concentrated in the subperiods in which leverage constraints for long-only investors are likely to be more severe.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: Z.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the effect of corporate tax avoidance (CTA) on U.S. firm-level sales and its aggregate implications. In theory, CTA gives a competitive edge to avoiding firms, which affects the distribution of sales in the economy. In practice, we find a causal impact of CTA on firm-level sales using a broad set of measures of tax avoidance and different identification strategies. Combining microestimates and the model, we assess how changes in CTA over the past two decades have shaped the distribution of sales across U.S. industries. Although the effects vary by sector, rising CTA among large firms has reinforced their dominant positions, contributing to increased concentration, in several key industries.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Funding: Financial support from the ENS Paris-Saclay Booster’s program, from the SSHRC [Insight Development Grant 207-2018-2019-Q1-00406], from the UQAM research chair on the local impact of multinationals, and from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique – FNRS [Grant No. F.4533.23] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05773 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Channel restructuring is a firm’s redesign and optimization of its channel system to serve markets more effectively. Restructuring demands significant investments of time, capital, and managerial attention, as firms must reconfigure processes, renegotiate agreements with channel partners, and manage the operational disruptions that inevitably accompany structural change. As even the most rigorously planned restructuring efforts can falter if partners do not buy in, it is paramount that firms secure the compliance of partners they seek to retain in the revised channel system. Prior research lacks a comprehensive and integrated conceptualization of channel restructuring, the available restructuring options, and the implications of restructuring for the firm’s downstream channel partners. We offer a channel restructuring typology comprising six restructuring types and delineate the functional role, status, and financial implications of each type for the firm’s partners. We provide theoretically grounded, testable propositions regarding the impact of restructuring on partner compliance. This paper offers scholars guidance for empirical investigation. It also highlights factors that practitioners should consider when designing and implementing channel restructuring to achieve both operational efficiencies and sustain partner relationships.</content>

    <title>Institutions and social entrepreneurship: a hierarchy of institutions to revisit institutional voids, support, and configurations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this retrospective, we expand on theorizing about institutions and social entrepreneurship (SE) as presented in our Decade Award-winning 2015 article. Our 2015 paper developed the institutional configuration perspective, which considers joint and interaction effects of formal and informal institutions. It organized disagreement about how formal institutions shape SE, contrasting the institutional voids and institutional support perspectives. In this retrospective, we introduce a revised hierarchy of institutions as a ‘middle-ground’ approach to advance research on institutions in international business and entrepreneurship. This hierarchy integrates insights from different disciplines (institutional economics, sociology, political science, and cultural theory). It explicates the macro-level economic and microfoundational psychological effects of four layers of formal (government activism and constitutional institutions/rule of law) and informal institutions (cultural values and norms). The hierarchy progresses research on institutional voids by distinguishing four types of formal and informal institutional voids. It advances research on institutional configurations by highlighting new synergistic and compensatory configurations. It also offers new insights into institutional change. Finally, we advance research on institutions and SE by theorizing a new institutional paradox for SE that reconciles the institutional void versus support debate and by charting opportunities for how institutions shape the SE process from entry to exit.</content>

    <title>Brief Commentary: Is “4 for $16” Better than “4 for $15.30”? Testing the Replicability of the Price Divisibility Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although higher prices generally lead to lower demand, research on the price divisibility effect suggests that consumers are sometimes willing to pay more for a multipack if its price is divisible by the number of units it contains. For instance, a 7-pack of shoelaces might be more appealing at the divisible price of $14 than at the lower, but non-divisible, price of $13. The original Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) article documenting this phenomenon presented a total of 15 studies, one of which was preregistered and all of which yielded strong evidence. In this article, we report four preregistered replications of three key studies from the original article. Despite our replications’ considerably larger sample sizes, none replicated the original results, and one yielded a marginally significant effect in the opposite direction. We consider several possible reasons for the discrepancies (e.g., selective reporting, data anomalies, time-related or context-related moderators) and discuss their theoretical and practical implications. Altogether, our findings imply that the price divisibility effect may not exist; if it does exist, it is not as robust or generalizable as originally claimed. Researchers and marketers should exercise caution before attempting to extend or apply research on the price divisibility effect.</content>

    <title>Brief Commentary: A Reexamination of the Effect of Forced Choice on Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When conducting studies in which the dependent variable is choice, researchers must decide whether to require participants to select one of the available alternatives or to provide a no-choice option. Prior research by Dhar and Simonson (2003) proposed that no-choice options can disproportionately reduce the share of certain alternatives, particularly all-average or compromise options. In this commentary, I reexamine the propositions and findings of Dhar and Simonson. I report the results of nine well-powered, pre-registered replications of their studies, which support only a subset of the authors’ hypotheses. Importantly, across the replication studies, no-choice options do not systematically draw share from specific alternatives. These findings suggest that no-choice effects may be more nuanced than previously thought and that the conditions under which previously documented effects occur reliably remain unclear. I discuss the implications of these results for theories of decision-making, context effects, and choice deferral. This work aims to update the literature and inform marketing researchers about the consequences of forcing choice versus allowing a no-choice option in experimental designs.</content>

    <title>Insiders Only: Are Our Ideas About What Makes “Good Theory” Holding Us Back?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer researchers often prize relevance but overlook how narrow assumptions about good theory limit it. Much of the work focuses on construct-to-construct theorizing, which involves introducing new constructs or new links among them. Far less valued is phenomenon-to-construct theorizing, which begins with real-world patterns and seeks to explain them by identifying the underlying active ingredient constructs. Examples include why GMO labels reduce demand, or why drip pricing leads people to choose higher-cost options. Our survey of authors in four leading journals shows that most believe only construct-to-construct work counts as theory. We argue this view is too narrow. Drawing on a Bayesian framework for updating beliefs within a theoretical network, we show that phenomenon-to-construct theorizing follows the same logic of scientific inference. Both approaches rely on established links in the nomological network to draw stronger conclusions about the focal link of interest. Using well-supported construct-to-construct mechanisms to explain real-world phenomena is therefore a strength, not a weakness. We clarify how phenomenon-to-construct theorizing differs from both “mere application” and “empirics-first” research. Embracing this form of theorizing can broaden the reach of consumer research by connecting abstract ideas to meaningful, actionable phenomena that matter to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.</content>

    <title>Public Information, Relative Overconfidence, and Capital Flows</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capital flows increase in response to new public information. Conventional explanations typically conclude that this reflects a rational response to reduced risk. However, investors may also be overconfident in their ability to benefit from new information, even when it is publicly available and does not provide a relative advantage. We exploit two complementary settings to examine how this “better‐than‐average” mechanism affects capital flows. Archival evidence from horse race betting markets shows capital flows increase following the public provision of a summary measure of horse performance, even though more total parimutuel wagering necessarily implies a greater wealth transfer from bettors to tracks. A controlled lab experiment provides direct causal evidence of our proposed mechanism. Combined, our results suggest that new public information can increase capital flows due to investors’ overconfidence in their ability to benefit from information relative to others. Our findings inform regulators seeking to understand the consequences of expanding the public information available to individual investors.</content>

    <title>Knowing (Not) to Know: Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Human Metacognition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many organizations seek to combine human expertise with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), but they often overlook a core requirement for effective collaboration; humans must understand their own abilities. This understanding of one’s own abilities is referred to as metacognition, which captures how well individuals monitor and regulate their own decision making. In two experiments with real estate and lending professionals, we find that XAI improves human metacognition by reducing their overconfidence. As a result, experts can better delegate decisions to an artificial intelligence (AI) and interact with it more effectively, improving the collaborative performance. These effects occur primarily when XAI highlights differences between human reasoning and AI logic. Our findings demonstrate that metacognition is a key mechanism through which XAI affects decision outcomes and offer guidance for organizations deploying (X)AI under growing transparency and accountability mandates, such as those in the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act.</content>

    <title>Social Class Signals in Recruitment: Investigating When and Why Signal Relevance and Job's Customer Contact Requirement Shape Hiring Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People may infer others' social class based on signals such as clothing, accents, university attended, or leisure activities. In recruitment and selection, such incidental social class signaling by candidates may occur, as information like this is often shared by candidates in application materials. Whether or how the visibility of candidates' social class information influences candidate evaluations, however, remains poorly understood. Building on signaling theory, we propose that social class level influence hiring decisions most when they contain job‐relevant content, particularly in roles that directly influence an organization's image to external stakeholders. We followed a three‐step, multi‐study approach: (1) developing stimulus materials in the form of interview response transcripts; (2) conducting two validation studies (N= 100 andN= 108, respectively), and (3) conducting a pre‐registered online vignette main study (N= 226). Results reveal that candidates with higher‐class signals were favored only when the class signals conveyed job‐relevant content. This class effect was most pronounced in roles that directly influence an organization's image, operationalized as high customer contact positions. Moreover, our findings show that perceptions of job fit, rather than cultural fit with the organization, drove these biased hiring evaluations. This study enhances our understanding of job‐level variations of social class bias in recruitment and underscores the importance of aligning job requirements closely with the role‐relevant core competencies to foster more equitable hiring practices.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Pricing and Demand Learning in Decentralized Supply Chains: Implications for Product Quality and Firm Profits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In modern consumer technology industries, manufacturers make substantial upfront investments in product quality, despite facing significant demand uncertainty—particularly regarding the size of the high-valuation segment that values quality highly. Dynamic pricing, where retailers adjust prices based on demand learning in the early period, may help mitigate this uncertainty. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine how a retailer’s dynamic pricing capability impacts a manufacturer’s wholesale pricing and product quality investment and whether it benefits both firms. In our model, the retailer can learn the proportion of high-valuation consumers by setting a high early price to target only that segment. This demand learning opportunity affects the manufacturer’s wholesale pricing strategy and its expected return on quality investment. We find that the retailer’s dynamic pricing improves product quality when the market is moderately likely to be good but has no effect when a good market is nearly certain. Dynamic pricing can also lead to either win-win or lose-lose outcomes: it benefits both firms when it mitigates double marginalization and enables broader market coverage, but harms both when it induces inefficient premium pricing and reduces total demand. We extend our main model to several settings, including cases where both firms have dynamic pricing capabilities and where consumer valuations follow a continuous distribution. While our main qualitative insights remain robust, we uncover several new findings. For example, when both firms (rather than only the retailer) can adjust prices dynamically, dynamic pricing is more likely to enhance product quality and increase the manufacturer’s profits.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Price Transparency in Healthcare: Understanding the Impacts of the Price Disclosure Policy in Maine</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates the operational and competitive effects of Price Transparency Regulation (PTR) in healthcare through both theoretical and empirical lenses. We leverage the launch of Maine’s price transparency website as a natural experiment and construct a Difference-in-Differences model to identify causal effects. Our analysis links patient flow patterns, negotiation dynamics, and revenue management strategies, offering a unique opportunity to unpack the multifaceted impacts of PTR. We quantify three mechanisms. First, PTR reshapes patient flow: with access to price information, patients become more price sensitive and switch to lower-cost providers, explaining nearly half of the observed 2.74–percentage point reduction in average prices. Second, PTR reduces negotiated claim prices by intensifying market competition (the competition effect) while also interacting with non-competitive factors such as provider bargaining power. Competitive factors, particularly insurer size and provider appeal, explain 80.7% of these supply-side reductions, while non-competitive factors account for the remaining. Third, the benefits are unevenly distributed: larger insurers capture greater reductions, while providers with strong patient appeal or broad service portfolios preserve pricing leverage. Together, these findings show that PTR reduces costs through both consumer switching and negotiation dynamics but also amplifies existing market imbalances, privileging larger stakeholders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online product reviews play a pivotal role in empowering consumers by reducing uncertainty about product attributes, a phenomenon widely studied from the demand perspective. However, the supply-side implications remain less understood—particularly how firms can leverage consumer reviews to develop an integrated pricing–quality strategy. To address this gap, we examine a firm’s dynamic pricing and product-quality decisions over two selling periods, where consumer reviews play a central role in shaping the market’s perception of a new experience good. Both the firm and its consumers are initially uncertain about the product’s perceived (market-based) quality and rely on early reviews to update their beliefs. Our analysis identifies two critical review metrics—volumeandvalence—as jointly shaping the firm’s optimal strategy. Review volume reflects initial sales, while valence measures the average rating. Together, these metrics generate what we call thelearning precision effect, whereby review information enhances the accuracy of quality inference and, in turn, guides the firm’s dynamic pricing and quality decisions. We find that, without the option to refine (adjust) quality after launch, the firm prefers a higher initial product quality and a lower introductory price to boost review volume and improve learning. When post-launch quality refinement is feasible, the learning precision effect intensifies, as the firm further increases initial quality to enhance learning from reviews. However, the resulting optimal pricing strategy in the first period can depart from conventional intuition. Depending on market conditions, the firm may either raise or lower the introductory price—relative to the case without quality refinement—in order to enhance review generation. A notable outcome is that the firm’s optimal strategy not only increases its overall profit but also improves consumer surplus for both early and late buyers. Although quality refinement is often expected to favor the firm at consumers’ expense, our results show that learning from reviews can generate a genuine win–win outcome. Finally, we extend our model to incorporate under-reporting bias, uninformed consumers, nonzero marginal quality costs, and alternative distributions of perceived quality, and find that our main insights remain robust across these variations.</content>

    <title>Transactive Memory Systems and Hospital Trauma Team Performance: Shared Experience in Action Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify and test a theoretical mechanism linking shared team experience and team performance: a transactive memory system (TMS). Our empirical context is the care of patients with severe acute traumatic injury in a hospital emergency department. We coded behavioral indicators of transactive memory from video recordings of trauma resuscitations in a hospital emergency department. We obtained objective measures of team performance—patient lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital—from hospital records, as well as information about the experience of team members. Our results of analyzing data from 121 patients reveal that patients treated by trauma teams with strong TMS experience significantly shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital than patients treated by trauma teams with weaker TMS. The magnitude of the effects was large: Increasing TMS by one standard deviation was associated with a reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS) of 3.3 days and a reduction in ICU LOS of 1.9 days. Experience working together predicted the strength of the team’s transactive memory over and above the effect of individual experience. Further, transactive memory mediated or explained the effect of team experience on team performance. These results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses in which we varied our definition of team experience and our modeling approach and included controls for team, task, and context characteristics. We discuss the implications of these findings for strengthening TMS in trauma resuscitation teams and for theories on transactive memory and organizational learning.Funding: This work was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Grant R35HL144804] and the Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation and Knowledge at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19022 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When returns are partially predictable and trading is costly, utility-maximizing investors track a target portfolio at a constant trading speed. The target portfolio is optimal for a frictionless market, where asset returns are scaled back to account for trading costs and volatilities are adjusted to proxy the “execution risk” of holding assets that are costly to trade and exposed to volatile states. The trading speed solves an optimal execution problem, which describes how the legacy portfolio inherited from the past is traded toward the target portfolio in an optimal manner. Unlike for period-by-period mean-variance preferences, the target portfolio hedges changes in investment opportunities, and both it and the trading speed are linked and depend on execution risk. We set the problem out first in an “absolute” framework—price shocks independent of the price level, and investors have CARA preferences—and then in a “relative” framework, with price shocks scaled by price levels and CRRA preferences. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in a model where market return predictions are based on a short-term momentum and a long-term value signal.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of employee health for the restructuring of the labor force during private equity buyouts using employee-level data of 56,000 Dutch buyout employees. We find no evidence that buyouts have a negative impact on the health of buyout employees. Employees lose income and employment after buyouts, and these losses are far larger for employees in poorer health. The negative effect of buyouts on employees’ incomes is buffered by social transfers, and this buffer is larger for employees in poorer health, who exit the labor market at a much higher rate. Health characteristics associated with lower wages in the general population are strongly predictive of job loss after buyouts.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [Projects MA 3317/3-1 and MA 3317/3-2].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01874 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study revisits the CEO pay-for-performance relation using two methodological innovations designed to address well-known measurement challenges. First, we aggregate pay and performance over the CEO’s entire tenure, allowing us to account for ex post settling up in pay. Second, we use realized compensation rather than ex ante estimates to better capture the actual economic rewards that CEOs receive. We find strong evidence of pay for performance in the full sample with a magnitude 2–10 times greater than that reported in previous studies. However, the pay-for-performance relation is asymmetric. CEOs who outperform their peer firms exhibit strong pay-for-performance sensitivity; those who underperform do not. This asymmetry arises because boards offset weak performance with incremental equity grants, undoing the mechanical correlation that results from declining stock prices. Finally, we show that underperforming CEOs are significantly more likely to be dismissed, suggesting that turnover, rather than lower pay, could be a disciplinary mechanism used by boards. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that tenure-aggregated realized pay better reveals how boards structure incentives and accountability over the full horizon of a CEO’s leadership.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge financial support from Columbia Business School, Columbia University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04322 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Colorism, or discrimination based on skin tone, has been widely documented as privileging lighter and disadvantaging darker skin tones in personal and professional contexts. In contrast to this, the current research uncovers a novel and positive “dark is hardworking” association in India. This association is theorized based on sociological accounts linking dark skin to outdoor labor, personal accounts of dark skin-toned individuals overcoming discrimination to achieve success, and widespread media cues featuring dark skin-toned achievers in arduous career pursuits. Darker skin tone thus cuesperceived competenceof service providers, driven by perceptions of being more hardworking. Evidence from six studies— including five experiments and a behavioral field study— demonstrates that while lighter skin continues to be advantageous in attractiveness-favoring professions (such as beauty consulting), darker skin offers a distinct advantage to service providers in competence-favoring fields (such as financial and technical services). Furthermore, highlighting competence can increase the preference for darker skin-toned professionals, even in attractiveness-favoring domains. This research contributes to the literature on stigmatized groups- specifically, colorism and its effects on stereotyped evaluation of service providers. The findings provide strategic insights for service providers and have implications for social policy.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Information Disclosure via Platform Endorsement in Online Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform endorsement is becoming increasingly popular and plays a critical role in online healthcare platforms by aiding patient choices and shaping doctors’ decisions. Using a unique dataset from a major Chinese online doctor consultation platform, this study applies a generalized synthetic control method to examine the impact of endorsement on patient demand, doctor service pricing, quantity, and quality. The findings show that endorsement significantly increases the price and quantity of paid services, while reducing free services among endorsed doctors. Despite handling higher service volumes, endorsed doctors maintain or improve quality. The endorsement program generates greater revenue for endorsed doctors and the platform, but it raises concerns about equity in healthcare access due to reduced free service provision for underprivileged patients. The analysis further reveals that the impact of endorsement varies between initial endorsement and re-endorsement as well as between high-prosocial and low-prosocial doctors. These findings underscore the nuanced role of information disclosure in shaping doctor behavior and patient access, offering important implications for platform design.</content>

    <title>The Dark Side of Managing Human–
                    &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt;
                    Collaborations: Implications for Leaders’ Moral Relativism and Unethical Behaviour</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As collaborations between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly prevalent across various industries, the role of leaders in managing these collaborations has grown in importance. While the existing literature has highlighted the benefits of leader management in these settings – emphasizing the complementary strengths of humans and AI – the potential costs to key stakeholders, particularly to leaders themselves, have been largely ignored. This research addresses this gap by drawing on moral relativism theory to develop and test a model explaining how leader management of human–AI collaborations may induce leaders’ moral relativism and, in turn, result in unethical behaviour at work. Furthermore, we identify leaders’ need for cognitive closure as a crucial individual difference that negatively moderates these effects. Findings from a critical‐incident experiment, two scenario‐based experiments, and one field survey conducted with samples from both Western and Eastern cultures (i.e., the United States and China) support our model.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the digital era, organizations are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize their operations and decision‐making. However, the opaqueness of AI processes raises concerns over trust, fairness, and autonomy, especially in the gig economy, where AI‐driven management is ubiquitous. This study investigates how explainable AI (xAI), through the comparative use of counterfactual versus factual and local versus global explanations, shapes gig workers’ acceptance of AI‐driven decisions and management relations, drawing on cognitive load theory. Using experimental data from 1107 gig workers, we found that both counterfactual (relative to factual) and local (relative to global) explanations increase the acceptance of AI decisions. However, the combination of local and counterfactual explanations can overwhelm workers, thereby reducing these positive effects. Furthermore, worker acceptance mediated the relationship between xAI explanations and management relations. A follow‐up study using a simplified scenario and additional procedural controls confirmed the robustness of these effects. Our findings underscore the value of carefully tailored xAI in fostering equitable, transparent, and constructive organizational practices in digitally mediated work environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Comparing mortgage rates that borrowers obtain to rates that lenders could offer for the same loan, we find that many homeowners significantly overpay for their mortgage, with overpayment varying across borrower types and with market interest rates. Survey data reveal that borrowers' mortgage knowledge and shopping behavior strongly correlate with the rates they secure. We also document substantial variation in how expensive and profitable lenders are, without any evidence that expensive loans are associated with a better borrower experience. Despite many lenders operating in the U.S. mortgage market, limited borrower sophistication may provide lenders with market power.</content>

    <title>Adverse Selection in Corporate Loan Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theories of competition typically predict a positive relationship between market concentration and prices. However, in loan markets, adverse selection can reverse this relationship as riskier borrowers become more likely to receive funding. Using supervisory data, we show that interest rates, borrower risk, and lending volume are higher in markets with more banks. We also create a novel measure of markup that is orthogonal to borrower risk, and find that, consistent with adverse selection, markups are higher after repeated borrowing relationships. Finally, we use a shock to large banks' lending costs to provide further support for the adverse selection channel.</content>

    <title>Going Public and the Internal Organization of the Firm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how initial public offerings (IPOs) affect firms' internal organization. We find that IPO firms become more hierarchical and standardized organizations, characterized by additional layers, more managers, smaller control spans, and larger administrative functions. These changes occur mostly in preparation for the IPO and can be only partially explained by growth. IPO firms with greater human capital risk experience larger hierarchical changes. Hierarchical changes help firms standardize employee roles and formalize internal processes. Our results suggest that firms reorganize to reduce their dependence on key individuals' human capital when transitioning to public markets.</content>

    <title>The nonlinear effect of consumer embarrassment on avoidance: A meta‐analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite longstanding assumptions that embarrassment leads to avoidance, empirical findings remain inconsistent. This meta‐analysis synthesizes 152 independent samples (N= 64,374) to clarify when and how embarrassment motivates avoidance. Drawing on Protection Motivation Theory, we find a curvilinear effect, where avoidance is strongest in moderately intense, embarrassing situations, but diminishes when embarrassment is either too weak to prompt concern or so intense that the consequences of avoidance become too severe to risk. This pattern underscores that avoidance is most likely when individuals perceive a moderate threat and believe avoidance is effective. Moderator analyses reveal that this effect is stronger for product‐related vs. medical contexts, when others are present, when embarrassment is anticipated (vs. experienced), and in collectivist cultures. Comparisons with guilt and shame further demonstrate that embarrassment operates through distinct, socially driven appraisals. These findings reconcile inconsistent findings in the embarrassment literature and offer guidance for reducing harmful avoidance by aligning threat and coping appraisals to promote engagement with socially sensitive behaviors. Implications for theory and practice, as well as future research priorities, are discussed.</content>
