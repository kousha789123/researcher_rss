    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interconnected agents such as firms in a supply chain make simultaneous preparatory investments to increase chances of honoring their respective bilateral agreements. Failures cascade with lasting repercussions further down the chain. How losses are shared affects how agents invest to avoid the losses in the first place. In this way, a solution sets agent liabilities depending on the point of disruption and induces a supermodular investment game. We characterize all efficient solutions. These have the form that later agents—who are not directly liable for the disruption—still shoulder some of the losses, justified on the premise that they might have failed anyway. Importantly, we find that such indirect liabilities are necessary to avoid unbounded inefficiencies. Finally, we pinpoint one efficient solution with several desirable properties.This paper was accepted by Peng Sun, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond [Grant 4260-00050B] and Carlsbergfondet [Grant CF18-1112].</content>

    <title>Market Design Choices, Racial Discrimination, and Equitable Microentrepreneurship in Digital Marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the potential of market design choices, specifically quality certification, to mitigate racial discrimination in digital marketplaces. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the discontinuity in Airbnb’s Superhost assignment, we find that Black hosts benefit 1.5 times more from the quality certification than other hosts. Moreover, we find compelling evidence that this disproportionate increase does not come at the expense of non-Superhost Black hosts. This suggests that quality certification can effectively reduce discrimination and promote equitable outcomes. Further, our analysis utilizing a doubly robust machine learning approach reveals that the effectiveness of quality certification persists even in the prominent presence of consumer reviews, a widely used market feature and a credible user-generated quality signal. Our research underscores the judicious use of market design in fostering equity for minority entrepreneurs in digital marketplaces.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01717 .</content>

    <title>Small worlds within global supply chains: implications for multinational enterprises’ environmental, social, and governance controversies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With increasing public attention to corporate sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) controversies emerging in global supply chains present a growing problem for multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper investigates whether MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers are more likely to be exposed to supplier-related ESG controversies. It also explores structural characteristics of global supply chains that can mitigate MNEs’ exposure to such controversies. Building on the literature on supply chain complexity and small-world networks, we suggest that the small-worldness of an MNE’s supply chain network can mitigate the impact of the geographical dispersion of suppliers on supplier-induced ESG controversies. Our analysis of the Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies from 2010 to 2019 reveals that MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers suffer from more supplier-induced ESG controversies, while small-worldness attenuates such impact. Our findings contribute to the international business literature by highlighting small-worldness as a network structural characteristic that can be deployed by MNEs to mitigate the negative impacts of supply chain spatial complexity.</content>

    <title>Real Effects of Non‐Streamlined Sales Tax Administration: Evidence from the Florida Hotel Industry</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether the local administration of sales taxes (as opposed to a more streamlined state administration) affects the real economy for businesses complying with the tax. We study this question in the Florida hotel industry, as counties in Florida can choose to locally administer the county‐level tourist tax or have the state administer the county‐level tax along with the state‐level tourist tax. Local administration is popular because it supports local employment (of tax administrators) and provides more stringent enforcement on non‐commercial operators (e.g., private rentals). State administration, however, has fewer compliance costs for hotels (e.g., reduced filings and fewer audits). Commentary from the profession suggests the incremental compliance costs of local administration can be considerable. We find that counties switching from state to local administration of tourist taxes is associated with slower growth in aggregate hotel payroll and employment, consistent with local tax administration increasing compliance costs to the point that affected businesses cut other services.</content>

    <title>From Smartphones to Smart Students: Learning vs. Distraction Using Smartphones in the Classroom</title>
    <updated>2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study evaluates the impact of classroom smartphone use on student performance through two large-scale randomized controlled trials in China. Students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (i) smartphones banned, (ii) smartphones allowed and used at will without guidance, (iii) smartphones allowed with teacher prompts to use them for instruction, and (iv) smartphones banned with teachers prompting the use of paper-based aids. Our findings show that unstructured smartphone use reduced performance compared with banning them, whereas teacher-guided use significantly enhanced learning outcomes. Paper-based aids yielded no measurable performance gain over the ban. We analyzed classroom video recordings to track individual-level time spent in each condition. We found that students spent similar total time learning across conditions, but teacher-directed smartphone use produced disproportionately large marginal learning gains outweighing the losses from distraction. Guided use also helped close gender and performance gaps though it risked widening digital divides by major and region. These results suggest educators should receive support to develop purposeful, app-based smartphone instruction materials; policymakers should avoid blanket bans and instead adopt structured usage policies; and tech developers should design classroom-friendly tools aligned with instructional goals. With thoughtful implementation, smartphones can become engines of equity, positive engagement, and learning within the classroom.</content>

    <title>On-Demand Healthcare Platforms: Impact of Question and Answer Service on Online Consultations and Offline Appointments</title>
    <updated>2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand healthcare platforms are increasingly integrating low-cost question and answer (Q&amp;A) services to help patients navigate care options. Using data from a major Chinese health platform, this study shows that Q&amp;A services drive both online and offline engagement—boosting online consultations by 2%, offline appointments by 4.3%, and consultation revenue by 6.6%. These services not only encourage follow-ups with the same doctor but also, generate spillover demand to other providers and specialties, especially those with higher professional titles. Patients benefit through better provider matching, fewer revisits, and reduced time spent browsing for care—all of which suggest improved outcomes. Q&amp;A serves as an effective entry point, reducing uncertainty and guiding patients to the appropriate level of care. From an operational perspective, the service increases demand without cannibalizing higher-margin services, offering a low-cost lever for engagement and conversion. Platforms should incentivize generalists and junior doctors, who often serve as initial touchpoints and channel traffic to specialists, to maximize the broader impact of Q&amp;A engagement. For providers and policymakers, the findings highlight how lightweight, scalable tools, like Q&amp;A, can improve care access and coordination—especially in fragmented systems where patients select providers without formal referrals.</content>

    <title>Changing tracks: How status affects category shifts in the Korean popular music industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how producers' status shapes their strategies for category shifting of their artists. Unlike prior research emphasizing its limitations, we argue that in creative industries, category shifting can offer substantial advantages. Focusing on producer‐driven markets, we propose that middle‐status producers align artists with market‐dominant categories, while high‐status ones pursue periodic radical shifts. However, for female artists, producers' influence on category shifts is constrained by audience expectations rooted in stricter institutional gender norms. Using a unique dataset from the Korean popular music industry, we find support for our hypotheses. We show that entertainment agencies' status influences the category‐shifting behaviors of idol groups. Yet, the impact of producer status is moderated by the broader gender expectations in which the artists are embedded.Managerial SummaryThis study explores how producers' status influences their approach to positioning their artists within existing market categories. Contrary to previous views focusing largely on limitations, we argue that category shifting in creative industries can bring significant benefits. In markets where producers drive the creative process, we suggest that those with moderate status tend to shift to follow popular categories, while high‐status ones opt for more radical changes. However, female artists face tighter constraints due to institutional norms. Drawing from data in the Korean popular music industry, we find evidence supporting our theory. We demonstrate how the status of entertainment agencies affects the category shifts of idol groups, though this effect is limited by broader gender expectations surrounding the artists.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In four large online experiments, we study how investors assess the relationship between stock portfolios and the market. Participants select or are randomly assigned a portfolio of stocks from a market index. They state portfolio return expectations conditional on different market outcomes, revealing implied beliefs about portfolio beta. We find general underestimation of beta which is stronger for downside beta. This asymmetry is amplified for participants who select their portfolio. They believe their portfolio goes up with the market but does not come down with it. We confirm biased beliefs about beta with financial professionals, monetary incentives, and alternative belief elicitation methods.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Seat Selection Surcharge and Allocation Policy in Selling High-Speed Train Tickets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a dynamic capacity control problem with seat selection and dynamic surcharge in the railway industry. In such problems, passenger arrives with a request for an itinerary, having a seat preference and a certain willingness-to-pay for seat preference. The decision-maker needs to decide at each time period whether to open each itinerary, a surcharge for each seat type in each open itinerary, and a seat assignment for each accepted request. The distinguishing feature of this problem is that the seat assignment decision is closely related to the surcharge decision — if the passenger chooses to pay the surcharge, then we must assign him/her a seat of preference, otherwise we can assign the passenger any seat on the train. Moreover, each accepted passenger must be assigned to a unique seat throughout the journey and it is not allowed to use a combination of seats to serve a passenger.We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem involving seat allocation and dynamic surcharge pricing. We consider a static problem in which demands of all requests are known but their arrival periods are unknown, and introduce a set of assignment consistency constraints to ensure the feasibility of opening and surcharge decisions when willingness-to-pay is uncertain. We then propose dynamic policies based on the static problem. In particular, we propose a booking limit control policy, two bid-price control policies and a re-solving a dynamic primal policy, and study the asymptotic loss of these policies. We also conduct numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of proposed policies and the potential gain of setting dynamic surcharges.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving Health Outcomes with Less Cost? Provision of Mobile Clinic in Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a public healthcare system consisting of a hospital, a mobile clinic (MC), and a population of potential patients. The government is concerned about the system’s healthcare spending and the population’s health outcomes. It decides the frequency and capacity of the MC service to maximize the social welfare that consists of two terms: the system’s long-run average healthcare cost and the population’s average quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We characterize the population’s natural disease progression using a Markov cohort model and derive the average healthcare cost incurred for the system and the average QALY in closed form for a given MC service. We show that the government is more likely to provide the MC service when (i) it puts more weight on the population’s average QALY, (ii) the MC treatment becomes more efficient, or (iii) the hospital treatment cost is much higher relative to the MC treatment cost. We further show that when conditions (ii) and (iii) are met or the disease progresses faster, the provision of the MC service is more likely to result in a win-win outcome, leading to both healthcare cost reduction and QALY improvement. The optimal MC delivery policy highly hinges on the disease’s progressive speed. Specifically, when the MC service is designated to serve a specific target population, once the MC service is provided, it shall be provided either every period or every other period if the disease is fast-progressive. If the disease is slow-progressive, the long-run average healthcare cost exhibits a zigzag pattern with the MC delivery cycle when the relative treatment cost-saving per person induced by the provision of the MC service is positive. Last, we conduct a real case study. Our analysis reveals that the optimal implementation of the MC program results in a 119.5% improvement in QALY and a 5% reduction in healthcare costs. The results are robust in probabilistic sensitivity analysis with a relative performance gap within 11.5% when factoring in uncertainty of the parameters.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Transaction Fee Mechanisms and User Welfare in Permissionless Blockchains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transaction fee is fundamental in maintaining the stability and decentralization of a permissionless blockchain, the infrastructure underlying major cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. This fee, set and paid by users when initiating each transaction, aggregates to over $24 million daily on Ethereum, imposing a non-trivial barrier to wider adoption. What is worse is that it is disproportionately borne by small users. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum started with a name-your-own-price style fee mechanism. Under this Legacy mechanism, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, only three-quarters of the transaction fee is necessary for users to attain the service quality they receive; the remaining one-quarter thus constitutes welfare loss. In August 2021, Ethereum implemented a fee mechanism change. Together, the Legacy methods and the new scheme, which we call Cap-Tip, describe the two most widely used fee mechanisms in all major permissionless blockchains. We explain the innovations embedded in the Cap-Tip mechanism through the lens of information quality and task decomposition. Collecting over 123 million transactions covering the change period, we estimate the causal impact of Cap-Tip on welfare improvement using a doubly robust difference-in-difference estimator that accommodates heterogeneity across timing of and exposure after adoption. The result is an astounding 80% reduction in welfare loss, achieved by users only six days after adoption. Interestingly, we also find that adoption benefits small users more than large ones, alleviating fee disparity and improving fairness. We theorize this difference through user experience and the overconfidence bias. Our study offers a novel operational perspective to unpack how the arguably most significant fee mechanism change in the blockchain space affects user welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stabilize the Dual Value and Alleviate the Primal Degeneracy of Linear Programs SimultaneouslyDual-optimal and deep dual-optimal inequalities (DOIs/DDOIs) are known to aid dual stabilization and accelerate convergence. In “Nested Set-Covering/Packing Problem: Degeneracy Alleviation and Dual Stabilization,” Siqi Guo, Fan Xiao, and Zhe Liang observe that DOIs/DDOIs also increase primal degeneracy, thereby extra effort is needed to prove optimality. Therefore, when addressing linear programs, it is critical to stabilize the dual as well as reduce primal degeneracy. This paper studies a nested multistage set-covering problem and proposes a nested set-covering model, which can be viewed as a traditional set-covering problem with special DDOIs. The authors derive strengthened reduced costs that can prescreen and prune degenerate variables and a pruning-and-pricing mechanism that utilizes both standard and strengthened reduced costs to price out promising variables. An efficient nested column-and-row generation algorithm is developed to exploit the benefits of both dual stabilization and degeneracy alleviation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Middle-Mile E-Commerce Order FulfillmentIn “E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Problem with Limited Time Window,” Zhou, Gümüş, and Miao investigate how online retailers can improve order fulfillment by utilizing the limited fulfillment window in middle-mile logistics. The authors first characterize an optimal policy and then, introduce two simple heuristic approaches for fulfillment decisions based on Lagrangian relaxation. They show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal when the number of demand locations increases. They also discover that integrating the information about remaining fulfillment windows into the decision-making process can yield additional benefits. Their findings suggest that online retailers can gain a competitive advantage by offering customers options, such as a “two-day fulfillment” service instead of a “same-day fulfillment” service, particularly when faced with limited logistical capacities.</content>

    <title>Does Privacy Regulation Harm Content Providers? A Longitudinal Analysis of the Impact of the GDPR</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns that the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would adversely affect the ability of news and media websites to create new quality content have not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. We construct a longitudinal data set of European Union (EU) and U.S. news and media websites to study how online content providers responded to the GDPR over time and whether potential restrictions on online tracking enforced by the regulation affected their downstream outcomes. We find robust evidence that both EU and U.S. news and media websites responded to the regulation by altering their data collection practices, but did so differently, with EU websites reducing tracking and implementing consent mechanisms at higher rates than their U.S. counterparts. Although we detect a reduction in average page views per user on EU relative to U.S. websites, we do not find evidence of negative impacts, in both the short and long term, on EU websites’ provision of new content or on several proxies for quality of that content, such as social media engagement metrics, various traffic measures, and articles’ text analytics. We also find no evidence of differences in survival rates across EU and U.S. news and media websites, and no evidence that monetization strategies changed at higher rates on EU relative to U.S. websites. The analysis suggests that EU online content providers did implement changes to their data collection practices in response to the GDPR but were able to use data minimization and consent mechanism strategies that allowed them to keep producing content and engage audiences at degrees on par with their U.S. counterparts.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What influences consumers to make product decisions alone versus with household partners? This research examines how consumers’ preference for solo or joint decision-making with household partners varies between product acquisition and disposal stages. Ten pre-registered studies demonstrate that for many household products, consumers are more likely to choose joint (vs. solo) decision-making with household partners for disposal than for acquisition. This asymmetry occurs because disposal (vs. acquisition) increases perceptions of the potential for infringement on a household partner’s rights, which increases the desire for clarity about a partner’s product valuation and thus the choice of joint (vs. solo) decision-making with one’s partner. The authors identify three process-consistent boundary conditions, wherein this acquisition-disposal asymmetry is mitigated: (1) when the product cannot be used by one’s partner, (2) when considering decisions with non-household members (e.g., non-cohabitating close friends) instead of one’s household partner, and (3) when the product’s price exceeds the household’s typical budget. Moreover, the authors discuss implications of this acquisition-disposal asymmetry for consumer well-being and marketing strategies, including its potential to cause delays in disposal decisions relative to acquisition decisions. This research contributes to understanding household decision dynamics and identifies a novel contributor to overaccumulation of household products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Package weight and calorie judgments play an important role in food-related consumer decisions. In this paper, the authors hypothesize and demonstrate that the bi-directional relationship between package stability and objective weight leads consumers to perceive visually more stable shapes as subjectively heavier: the “shape stability effect” (Study 1). The stability effect is mitigated (replicated) when the context makes volume (weight) judgments more accessible than weight (volume) judgments (Study 2). The shape stability effect has consequences for calorie perceptions (Study 3A) and consumption decisions (Study 3B). We also examined the implications for consumers’ WTP (Study 4A). Analysis of an archival data set (Study 4B) shows that for tasty (healthy) products, price is positively (negatively) associated with shape stability. Theoretically, these results add to the literature on volume and weight judgments, and calorie perceptions. Managerial implications for food packaging and positioning are offered.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Benefits from Alternative Data for Credit Scoring? Evidence from Peru</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion individuals worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to credit due to the absence of traditional credit scores. In this paper, we demonstrate how retail transaction data can be used to construct an alternative credit score, potentially expanding credit access for these individuals. Our study utilizes a unique dataset obtained through a partnership with a Peruvian company. We merge customer loyalty data and credit card repayment data with administrative records from the Peruvian financial system, which provide detailed financial histories of individuals. This comprehensive dataset allows us to construct credit scores for individuals both with and without a credit history. Through simulations of credit card approval decisions, we find that incorporating retail data increases approval rates for individuals without a credit history, from 16% to between 31% and 48%. In contrast, for those with an established credit history, approval rates remain largely unchanged at around 88%. We investigate why retail data particularly benefits individuals without a credit history and discuss the broader implications of this credit scoring methodology for consumers, firms, and policymakers. Our findings highlight its potential to transform credit access for millions of previously unbanked individuals.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Self-Preferencing on Digital Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms facilitate exchanges between platform actors, such as trading between buyers and sellers. However, providers of digital platforms also compete with other actors, referred to as third parties, on their own platforms. In such settings,self-preferencingcan occur if the platform treats its own offerings better than comparable third-party offerings—a practice often deemed inappropriate. However, detecting self-preferencing is challenging. This article addresses this challenge conceptually and empirically by putting forward a conceptual framework that defines self-preferencing and conceptualizes two self-preferencing tests. It implements this framework empirically in two studies across three international Amazon marketplaces using a novel metric to measure a product’s non-personalized visibility. The aggregate findings provide little evidence for self-preferencing in both studies. However, the more disaggregated findings at a country- and product category-level vary from weak self-preferencing to strong self-depreferencing. As implementing self-preferencing tests requires researchers to choose between several empirical alternatives and assumptions, the approach proposed herein includes extensive sensitivity, specification curve, and heterogeneity analyses whose results support the robustness of the findings.</content>

    <title>Gaining Career Purpose Through Lightning Bolts: Examining the Strength and Psychological Foundations of Work-Related Epiphanies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Epiphanies—sudden realizations that transform how people see themselves—have the potential to infuse people’s personal and professional lives with a renewed sense of purpose. Yet, the prominence and potency of epiphanies as purpose-giving vehicles has largely been overlooked in management and organization studies. In the research reported here, we investigate epiphanies and their psychological foundations. Specifically, we build and test theory on what types of individuals, psychologically speaking, are more likely to experience epiphanies of greater strength related to their work and careers. We evaluate the strength of the work-related epiphanies that people experienced over the course of their lives (Study 1) and in the context of a leadership development program (Study 2) and a leadership coaching workshop (Study 3). Consistent with our theorizing, we find that people who engage in a form of mind wandering known as “problem-solving daydreaming” are more likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength. Furthermore, we find that people who engage in problem-solving daydreaming are especially likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength when they possess a form of curiosity that compels them to solve their problems (“deprivation sensitivity”). Work-related epiphany strength, in turn, transmits this conditional effect onto people’s sense of purpose in their careers via psychological tension resolution. These results illuminate psychological phenomena underlying sudden shifts in how people view themselves and open new windows into how a heightened sense of career purpose can emerge among individuals on a managerial career path.</content>

    <title>Global ecological dependence and multinationals’ climate innovation: the role of climate risk exposure and institutional conditions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change poses significant global challenges to multinational enterprises (MNEs). One crucial solution hinges on the development of new technologies to mitigate climate change or adapt to its adverse effects. However, it remains unclear what factors can effectively motivate MNEs’ development of climate innovation. Integrating the resource dependence theory and the natural resource-based view, we argue that MNEs’ strategies are shaped by their dependence on the global ecological environment for natural resources—coined here asglobal ecological dependence. When exposed to elevated climate risks, MNEs tend to engage in climate innovation to assuage the uncertainty associated with their global ecological dependence. This tendency is moderated by climate-related formal and informal institutions that alter the perceived benefits and costs of climate innovation: stringent regulatory demand for climate action weakens this tendency as it increases firm costs and can divert resources, whereas heightened societal demand enhances this tendency as it can increase MNEs’ perception of the benefits of climate innovation. We find evidence for our hypotheses in a panel of MNEs listed in the United States from 1995 to 2017. Our study contributes to resource dependence theory and extends our understanding of climate innovation as a viable solution to climate change.</content>

    <title>Blockchains for Environmental Monitoring: Theory and Empirical Evidence from China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the effects of a blockchain-based environmental monitoring technology on emissions. Our model of firm competition in the presence of regional regulators reveals that blockchain adoption reduces industrial pollution but triggers business relocation, creating trade-offs between local emission reduction and economic contraction. When pollution-induced social losses are highly dispersed across cities, a partial-adoption equilibrium fails to mitigate aggregate emissions because of the pollution leakage. We further present the first piece of empirical evidence corroborating model predictions, by taking advantage of a recent regulation change in China. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, and CO in blockchain-adopting cities are on average 16.6%, 7.9% and 4.6%, respectively, lower than other cities. However, blockchain-based monitoring disproportionately hurts the industrial sector, and the average economic activities is reduced by 1.8%-2.6%. Firms in adopting cities open more non-local plants to avoid regulation.</content>

    <title>Social‐Symbolic Work of Engaging Heterogeneous Communities: Participation Work and Entangled Effects on Organizations and Communities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Community participation is recognized as a crucial yet problematic element for addressing many issues in social development. Generating participation, however, is particularly challenging due to existing inequalities within heterogeneous communities, making it difficult for organizations to engage marginalized groups while letting go of their own control. We explore how organizations facilitate community participation through a qualitative comparative case study of two community radio stations in India. We find two approaches based on how organizations leverage three levels of influence: (1)open participation workleverages community members as audience and volunteers/staff by drawing on commonality between them. Furthermore, it defers decision making to community hierarchy; (2)protective participation workengages audience and volunteers/staff from marginalized groups, focusing on their differences from other community members, and defies community hierarchy in decision making. These two approaches led to contrasting outcomes: open participation work led to a pliable organization that invited the community in, but preserved community inequalities, and protective participation work led to a directive organization that restricted participation, but disrupted community inequalities. In unpacking these approaches, we extend the social‐symbolic work literature by theorizing how participation work creates entangled effects on the organization and community.</content>

    <title>What If We Are the WEIRD Ones? A Call (and Roadmap) for More Non-WEIRD Entrepreneurship Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship researchers have focused on WEIRD samples—that is, Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic samples. This editorial suggests that not all theories formed on and tested with WEIRD samples are generalizable to non-WEIRD contexts. A richer picture of entrepreneurial phenomena can come from non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research, especially (but not exclusively) by non-WEIRD researchers with local knowledge and interests. In this editorial, we hope to motivate more non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research by highlighting the potential problems with the dominance of a WEIRD perspective in our most impactful research, introducing each element of a non-WEIRD approach to solve those problems, and offering some big-picture thoughts and methods as future research opportunities. Indeed, we provide research opportunities that could lead to contextualized entrepreneurship theories embedded in contexts not well represented in the mainstream entrepreneurship literature, largely devoted to the WEIRD. We conclude this editorial with recommendations for reviewers and editors of these mainstream entrepreneurship journals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an agenda setting seminar in 1997, when entrepreneurship was just emerging as a serious field of scholarship, Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow offered a challenging null hypothesis, namely, that entrepreneurship being a stochastic phenomenon, educational content is unlikely to make a difference in startup rates or success thereafter. With a view to begin tackling this null, we utilize a nationwide educational reform as a quasi‐experiment to investigate the effect of business and entrepreneurship‐oriented education on (i) early age startup (i.e., direct effects) and (ii) postgraduation choices that may lead to startup activity later (i.e., indirect effects). We find evidence for positive direct and indirect effects and discuss implications for future research into the design of entrepreneurship education policies as well as content and teacher training.Managerial SummaryA variety of entrepreneurship programs exist at prestigious universities to stimulate startup for students who enroll in these based on entrepreneurial preferences and intentions. The resulting new ventures created are important drivers of innovation, economic growth, and job creation. Our study indicates that exposure to business and entrepreneurship content at an earlier age is equally important. Both in terms of obtaining a realistic insight into entrepreneurship as a career, leading to more realized startups of high quality but also in terms of developing a preference for entrepreneurship affecting subsequent choices regarding tertiary education and employment in favor of future entrepreneurship. We suggest investments in broadening entrepreneurship education for all in contrast to for specific targeted groups such as university or technology entrepreneurs.</content>

    <title>The signal of institutional governance in early‐stage financing for university spinoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;University spinoffs (USOs) translate scientific advancement to economic gains, but the role of the university's governance as a public or private institution is infrequently explored. With a novel dataset of academic entrepreneurs with National Science Foundation I‐Corps training, we examine institutional governance as a fundraising signal. We demonstrate how angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) show a preference for private USOs. However, with different investment objectives, the groups conduct distinct sensemaking that weighs this cue differently. For angels, industry moderates the effect such that they prefer private university life science firms to public USOs. However, industry mediates the effect for VCs, who prefer life sciences to engineering. We describe this variation as mixed salience—when a signal yields differences in decision‐making for distinct audiences.Managerial SummaryUniversity spinoffs (USOs) are important for economic growth, but little is known about differences between USOs from public and private universities. We study how angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) fund USOs of public and private schools. These two investor groups make funding decisions with different priorities and approaches. Both groups appear to prefer private universities. A deeper look reveals that angel investors prefer private university life science teams to the public university counterparts. On the other hand, VCs prefer life sciences teams to engineering teams—and life sciences teams are more likely to come from private schools. Evidently, the two investor audiences respond to the public/private distinction in different ways.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the infrastructure of decentralized exchanges subjects liquidity providers (LPs) to a “tragedy of the commons.” Liquidity providers lack incentives to exit liquidity pools to prevent arbitrage losses, as these are collectively shared, while withdrawal costs are borne individually. Arbitrage rents primarily flow to validators as infrastructure fees, with the median arbitrageur transferring 96% of profits. Proposed solutions—speed technology, alternative sequencing rules, and flexible pricing curves—fail to reduce these rents. Leveraging the Silicon Valley Bank crisis as a natural experiment, we show that LPs defensively adopt more convex pricing curves to mitigate adverse selection risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new asset pricing model that generalizes the mean-variance framework by including probability weighting, specifically the overweighting of rare, high-impact events. Our model—the Π-CAPM—generates several new predictions: (i) skewness has a positive price effect, amplified by volatility; (ii) the price effect of volatility is negative for left-skewed assets but positive for right-skewed assets; and (iii) option-implied variance premiums for stocks have a U-shaped relation to skewness, amplified by volatility. We find strong empirical support for these predictions. Finally, we show that the Π-CAPM predicts an exaggerated co-movement of assets and can explain the correlation premium.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use publicly available information to estimate the country location of multinational firms’ cash holdings, examine why investors discount the value of cash held overseas, and examine whether that discount changes after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. We provide three main results. First, our firm-year foreign cash estimates are reasonably accurate, evidenced by high correlations with simulated data and proprietary country-level data, high adjusted R2when explaining a firm’s total cash holdings, and the ability to replicate prior findings. Second, we demonstrate that investors value foreign cash holdings more negatively than domestic cash holdings when the cash is held in high agency-cost countries. Finally, we find that investors no longer appear to discount foreign cash after the TCJA, when the U.S. moved from a worldwide to a quasi-territorial taxation system.</content>

    <title>CFO narcissism and the power of persuasion over analysts: a mixed-methods approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of CFO narcissism in the intent and ability to positively influence sell-side analysts’ perceptions of the firm. Consistent with narcissists casting favorable impressions on others, we find CFO narcissism is associated with overly optimistic analyst valuations. We then study public persuasion attempts by analyzing conference call transcripts and private persuasion attempts through a laboratory study. In the conference call setting, we show that narcissistic CFOs use more persuasive language and are more inclined to call on bearish analysts, both of which we link to price target revisions following the call. In the lab study, we simulate a one-on-one conversation and find that narcissists are especially more likely to use coercive methods to induce higher valuations from analysts. Collectively, we show that narcissistic CFOs use persuasion to favorably influence analysts’ perceptions of firm value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the effect of climate risks on corporate bond mutual funds’ trading activities and explores its mechanism. We find that investor flows negatively respond to mutual funds’ carbon exposure, using the Paris Agreement as a shock event. Such carbon-induced redemptions prompt mutual funds to sell bonds issued by high-carbon companies, especially for funds with high outflow-to-carbon sensitivity. Our findings do not support the alternative hypothesis that a fundamental shift in funds’ investment preferences drives the reduction in high-carbon holdings. Finally, we document a deterioration in the liquidity of high-carbon bonds, particularly those heavily owned by mutual funds.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between temperature changes and firm performance using a novel time-varying measure of firm-level temperature sensitivity. We find that firms with higher temperature sensitivity have lower future profitability and riskier corporate policies. These firms are also overpriced and earn lower average future returns as market participants are slow to correct the mispricing. Nonlocal institutional investors allocate higher portfolio weights to firms with high temperature sensitivity, and sell-side equity analyst forecasts are less accurate for these firms. Together, these results suggest that financial markets underreact to information about firm-level temperature sensitivity, and this generates predictable patterns in returns. A trading strategy that exploits this mispricing generates an annualized risk-adjusted return of more than 4% during the 1968–2020 period.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00972 .</content>

    <title>Mitigating Exposure Bias for Recommendations in Physical Spaces: An Unbiased Pairwise Ranking Approach Using Spatial Movement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the remarkable success of personalized recommendations on digital platforms, brick-and-mortar businesses are increasingly exploring artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommendation services in physical spaces. To address this emerging need, our study introduces a generalized recommendation problem, termed point-of-interest (POI) recommendations in physical spaces with pedestrian movement (P3M). Applicable scenarios for P3M include store recommendations in shopping malls, product shelf recommendations in hypermarkets, and so on. A critical impediment in P3M is exposure bias: When the exposure likelihood of items to users is unevenly distributed, indiscriminately treating all unobserved interactions as negative feedback introduces bias to the learning of recommender systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel recommendation method, unbiased movement-aware pairwise ranking (UMPR), which integrates pedestrian movement modeling with unbiased pairwise learning to achieve effective and unbiased recommendations. Using real-world shopping mall data, we demonstrate that UMPR not only delivers more accurate recommendations compared to state-of-the-art methods but also brings added monetary value for mall owners and promotes humanistic fairness across store tenants. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of mitigating exposure bias through pedestrian movement modeling, advancing the field of recommendations in physical spaces.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We first document that, despite potential legal issues, overlapping directors are surprisingly prevalent among direct competitors. Using panel data regressions and plausibly exogenous shocks, we find that competing firms in markets with dense overlapping-director networks experience innovation herding, lose product differentiation, and, ultimately, perform poorly. Novel text-based network propagation tests of technologies show that intellectual property leakage plays a role as firms with dense overlapping director networks experience faster propagation of technologies to competitors. Our findings suggest a coordination problem where industry participants cannot stop rivals from earning small gains from leakage despite much larger industry-wide negative externalities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should the seller display all available products in a setting with multiple products or only offer a subset? Is there a benefit of withholding some products? The seller does not want to display low-margin products due to cannibalization, but what if all products have the same margin? In “Performance of the Offer-Everything Policy,” W. T. Huh, J. Paat, and M. Queyranne argue that in an environment where the seller cannot adjust assortment based on customer types, it is best to offer all available products in an environment. The analysis is based on competitive ratio and expected revenue. This research assures that a common practice of truthfully revealing product availability is a generally good policy to follow.</content>

    <title>Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although experimental design often focuses on selecting the single best alternative from a finite set, many pure-exploration problems pursue richer goals. Given a specific goal, adaptive experimentation aims to achieve it by strategically allocating sampling effort, with the underlying sample complexity characterized by a maximin optimization problem. In "Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration," Qin and You introduce a unified dual-directed framework for efficiently solving general pure-exploration problems, yielding a unified algorithm design principle that extends the top-two approach beyond best-arm identification. Their theoretical analysis proves asymptotic optimality for classical problems, such as Gaussian best-arm identification, thresholding bandits, and epsilon-best-arm identification. Extensive numerical experiments confirm these theoretical insights, showcasing significant improvements over existing methods. This dual-directed framework offers researchers and practitioners a powerful and versatile tool to navigate uncertainty and optimize exploration strategies effectively.</content>

    <title>A Separation of Utility and Beliefs Through Betting Consistency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For standard preferences under uncertainty, minimal requirements are proposed to identify cardinal utility and subjective, potentially nonadditive, beliefs. This is achieved through an application of betting consistency. This preference principle says that outcome midpoints derived from preferences over bets on an event are also midpoints when elicited from bets on a different event. This consistency requirement provides a simplified elicitation tool, while it also serves as a robustness test for utility measurements. An analyst can use betting consistency to identify a client’s cardinal utility index independent of the client’s beliefs. This follows from our simplified foundation for the biseparable utility model, the widely adopted framework for empirical measurements of utility under various sources of uncertainty. As a theoretical tool, betting consistency can be adopted to provide simple and intuitive foundations for new and for existing decision theories. For instance, an event-dependent version of betting consistency, if it is supplemented with Savage’s sure-thing principle or a version of that principle restricted to acts that satisfy Schmeidler’s comonotonicity property, delivers subjective expected utility or Choquet expected utility, as desired. We also demonstrate how models with specific nonadditive beliefs can easily be derived through bespoke formulations of betting consistency.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>Tending to the Particular: Navigating Tensions Around Principles of Alternativity Through an Ethics of Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alternative organizations must continuously address conflicts that emerge regarding diverging prioritizations and interpretations of autonomy, solidarity, and responsibility. We explore how tensions around alternative moral principles can be navigated through relational processes that attune to others' needs, emotions, and concerns. Building on an organizational ethnography of a cooperative campaign agency, we mobilize ethics of care as a research lens to trace and analyse how relational activities that are infused by an ethical attention to particular others assist the organization in dealing with these tensions. Our findings show that three relational activities – inquiring, deliberating, and responding – constitute a “relational tension‐navigation circuit” that enables the alternative organization to evoke, map, and situatively settle tensions around alternative principles by embracing the vulnerability, plurality, and flourishing of others. We contribute to relational, ethical, and processual research in alternative organizing by showing how the particular and the general can be productively enfolded in alternative organizations. Furthermore, we conceptualize a broad, ethically and relationally grounded understanding of revisability that supports alternative organizations in finding targeted adaptations and provisional solutions to address conflicts and tensions.</content>

    <title>When do Firms with New CEOs Engage in M&amp;amp;A? Understanding the Timing of New CEOs' First M&amp;amp;A Announcements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New CEO appointments can create strategic uncertainty for stakeholders, potentially undermining the CEO's position. While the stakeholder uncertainty perspective suggests CEOs may act boldly to clarify their strategic intentions during early tenure, the CEO life cycle perspective proposes that CEOs avoid such moves during early tenure, as they still need to learn. This study integrates these views to examine whether and when new CEOs under high strategic uncertainty make bold strategic choices during early tenure. Focusing on first acquisitions – especially large and cross‐border deals – we argue that new CEOs have a higher hazard of announcing an acquisition under high strategic uncertainty, namely, outsider CEOs and those whose appointments were more negatively received. Leveraging the time CEOs spend in their role as a conceptual bridge between the two perspectives, we argue that the acquisition hazard under high strategic uncertainty increases over early tenure, as CEOs gather information and learn. Analysing 873 new US CEOs (2004–2020) with an extended Cox hazard model, we find a generally higher hazard of first acquisition announcements for outsider CEOs and those with more negative appointment reactions, especially for bolder deals. Evidence on time dependence is mixed, but more pronounced for outsider CEOs and large acquisitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose CTREND, a new trend factor for cryptocurrency returns, which aggregates price and volume information across different time horizons. Using data on more than 3,000 coins, we employ machine learning methods to exploit information from various technical indicators. The resulting signal reliably predicts cryptocurrency returns. The effect cannot be subsumed by known factors and remains robust across different subperiods, market states, and alternative research designs. Moreover, it survives the impact of transaction costs and persists in big and liquid coins. Finally, an asset pricing model that incorporates CTREND outperforms competing factor models, providing a superior explanation of cryptocurrency returns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates (1) whether misreporting by corporate executives impacts unethical decision‐making by non‐peers in unrelated reporting tasks, and (2) whether observing various forms of punishment for corporate misreporting deters this spillover effect. Specifically, we examine the deterrent effects of two common forms of punishment (fines or imprisonment) and a novel form of punishment (public shaming). Across two experiments, we find that participants are more likely to misreport performance when exposed to media reports about executives engaging in financial misreporting. This evidence is consistent with executive misreporting leading to unethical decision‐making among non‐peer observers. We also find that participant misreporting is reduced when the media reports the punishments levied against those executives. In further mediation tests, our findings suggest observed punishments for corporate misconduct can influence perceptions of injunctive norms and potentially mitigate spillover in unethical behavior.</content>

    <title>Signaling Quality to Consumers: The Role of Social Media Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly turning to social media marketing to boost product visibility and spread consumer-generated content, which often reveals valuable information about product quality. However, our research shows that this dual role can backfire; heavy spending on social media marketing may no longer help high-quality firms stand out. Instead of investing heavily to reach a broad audience, high-quality firms may do better by cutting back and focusing on targeted niche markets. Furthermore, as consumers become more capable of discerning product quality through social media content, low- and medium-quality firms benefit less from mimicking one another. This creates stronger incentives for lower-quality firms to mimic the high-quality firm, which increases consumer confusion and weakens the quality signal conveyed through investment in social media marketing. These findings help explain the variation in firms’ social media marketing strategies and offer practical guidance on allocating social media budgets more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I document a significant gender gap in entrepreneurs’ access to early-stage equity financing. Using unique administrative data on French startups, I show that this gap is particularly pronounced in male-dominated sectors. Controlling for a comprehensive set of entrepreneur and startup characteristics—including demographics, backgrounds, and motivations—accounts for 42% of the average gender gap. However, in male-dominated sectors, 80% of the gap remains unexplained. Growth-oriented female entrepreneurs rely more heavily on bank loans, substituting equity with debt. Finally, VC-backed female-founded startups outperform their male counterparts in male-dominated sectors. These findings suggest that context-dependent stereotypes influence equity financing decisions. (JEL G24, G41, J16, L26)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do real assets protect against inflation? Stocks’ core inflation betas are negative, while their energy betas are positive. Currencies, commodities, and real estate mostly hedge against energy inflation, but not core inflation. These hedging properties are reflected in the prices of inflation risks: only core inflation carries a negative risk premium, and its magnitude is consistent within and across asset classes, uniquely among macroeconomic risk factors. Energy inflation has become more procyclical and volatile since the 1990s, which helps explain the time-varying correlation between stock and bond returns. A two-sector New Keynesian asset pricing model accounts for these facts quantitatively. (JEL E31, G11, G12)</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Effectiveness of Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Chinese Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global shift from face-to-face instruction to online learning, posing new operational challenges for business schools, particularly in equipping students with quantitative skills essential for the labor market. Leveraging China’s abrupt lockdown policies as a natural experiment, we examine the heterogeneous effects of online education on student academic performance. Using a panel dataset of 15,329 observations from 7,867 undergraduate students across nine Chinese universities over four semesters (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), we compare academic outcomes before and during the transition to online learning. We find that online education led to an average increase of 8 to 11 points in mathematics scores on a 100-point scale during the pandemic. Applying principal component analysis, we identify four key policy measures that capture lockdown stringency: stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, public transportation suspension, and public information campaigns. Stricter stay-at-home orders issued by the government reduce the effectiveness of online learning; however, these negative effects are partially offset by increased parental supervision and reduced external distractions resulting from workplace closures and the suspension of public transportation. Further, online learning is more effective for reasoning-focused courses (e.g., mathematics) than interpretation-focused courses (e.g., English), and the academic benefits of face-to-face peer interactions diminish significantly in online settings relative to offline environments. Our findings offer actionable insights for managing educational delivery during operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of tailoring online curriculum design and support systems to course content and student mobility constraints.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Consistency in Service Delivery: Examining the Effect of Process Standardization on Hospital Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare services provided to patients with similar medical conditions are known to vary. Standardization of healthcare delivery is a relatively new, yet hotly debated approach to address clinical variations. Previous research on process standardization in health service delivery has focused on measuring adherence to established protocols available only for a limited set of medical conditions. We create an alternate construct that quantifies process standardization measured in terms of consistency in services rendered, and apply it in a healthcare context using detailed nonpublic inpatient discharge data from about 35 million inpatient stays at acute care hospitals in California between 2008-2016. We examine the impact of such process standardization on the cost, quality, and variation in quality of care delivered at the hospital, operating unit, and medical condition level. We find that process standardization is associated with reductions in cost per discharge, readmission rate and variation in readmission rates at the hospital level. We also find that the impact of process standardization varies across different operating units and medical conditions, providing cost and quality benefit in majority of cases. We further conduct post-hoc analysis on the degree of process standardization, finding that higher rates of capacity utilization and complexity of patient disease mix is associated with a lower process standardization, while increasing focus and process adherence is associated with an increase in process standardization.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Imperative vs. Linguistic Alignment: Organizations Use Language to Modify Environmental Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Analysis on how organizations and the environment interact starts with the common assumption that mutual understanding and agreement are beneficial for organizations. The process of building such an agreement and the consequences of agreement versus disagreement are an active research topic and one that calls for additional research. We add evidence to this debate by performing a replication of the initial findings on the costs of category spanning. We also introduce the concept of linguistic alignment, defined as the intersection of organizational self-description and environmental understanding of the organization. We specify a measurement strategy for linguistic alignment and test the implications of linguistic alignment of U.S. public firms and securities analysts over the last two decades with a novel embedding alignment technique. We find that firm values are reduced when spanning categories, but linguistic alignment is a better predictor of firm value. In addition to this direct effect, linguistic alignment reduces the value reduction of firms with a multi-industry presence. This means that organizations that can manage their self-presentation to achieve linguistic alignment with external audience analysts to obtain better evaluations.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Science Research Council [SICSS Research Grant] and the National Science Foundation Division of Social and Economic Sciences [Grant SES-1236931].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19341 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimization problems with discrete decisions are nonconvex and thus lack strong duality, which limits the usefulness of tools such as shadow prices. It was shown in Burer (2009) that mixed-binary quadratic programs can be written as completely positive programs, which are convex. We apply this perspective by writing unit commitment in power systems as a completely positive program and then using the dual copositive program and strong duality to design new pricing mechanisms. We show that the mechanisms are revenue-adequate and, under certain conditions, support a market equilibrium. To facilitate implementation, we also employ a cutting plane algorithm for solving copositive programs exactly, which we further speed up via a second-order cone programming approximation. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the potential benefits of the pricing mechanisms and algorithms.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00906 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honest and dishonest behaviors may both diffuse among the members of an organization. Knowing which of the two spreads faster is important because it impacts the extent to which managers will need to resort to other, potentially more costly solutions to curb dishonest behavior. Assessing empirically which of honest behavior or dishonest behavior spreads faster is challenging because this requires field measurements of social relationships and dishonest behavior of individual members, which poses both measurement and inference problems. We examine an original fine-grained data set from a large company that allows for identifying agents likely to be dishonest and interactions among employees while offering a natural experiment that circumvents the inference problems associated with identifying peer-to-peer diffusion. We find (1) that dishonest behavior diffuses, whereas honest behavior does not; (2) that diffusion likely operates through spreading information about opportunities for collusion; and (3) that policies that screen on dishonesty at hiring may be efficient to curb dishonest behavior in environments with high turnover.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an era of escalating disruptions—from pandemics to economic crises—organizational resilience is vital for survival and growth. This study offers actionable insights for business leaders and policymakers on strategically leveraging information technology (IT) resources and leadership structures to navigate major shocks. We demonstrate that although diverse IT portfolios (e.g., cloud systems, data analytics tools) can enhance resilience by enabling adaptability, balance is key: moderate IT diversity strengthens resilience, but excessive diversity creates coordination complexities that erode it. Crucially, empowering IT leaders with formal decision-making authority helps firms maximize IT flexibility, shifting this tipping point to harness greater IT diversity without compromising coordination. Our analysis of firms during the pandemic reveals that crisis-induced industry turbulence further shapes these dynamics. Adverse turbulence intensifies the risks of overdiversification, requiring tighter alignment between IT strategies and leadership oversight. Conversely, beneficial turbulence allows firms to experiment with IT resources more freely. Policymakers can support businesses by fostering digital infrastructure, incentivizing IT leadership training, and creating frameworks for public-private data sharing during emergencies. By aligning IT flexibility with coordinated execution, firms can turn crises into opportunities for sustained success. This research equips stakeholders with evidence-based strategies to future-proof operations in an unpredictable world.</content>

    <title>Rent Extraction Amid Borrowers’ Adversity: Evidence from Activist Short Sellers’ Attacks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Finance theory suggests that the privileged information that traditional banks obtain about borrowers through monitoring creates opportunities for banks to impose informational hold-up costs on such borrowers. Because a surge in borrower risk increases banks’ hold-up power, banks with information monopoly should be able to increase their rates beyond the level explained by borrower risk alone. We test this theory using the setting of activist short sellers’ public allegations—a setting that increases borrower risk and restricts borrower access to public financing sources—and find, on average, that, after controlling for both ex ante and ex post changes in borrower credit risk, banks increase loan pricing following activist short sellers’ allegations. Our loan pricing results not explained by changes in borrower credit risk are consistent with banks extorting borrowers during times of adversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel dataset that provides a comprehensive coverage of U.S. firms' industrial supply chain relationships, we find that firms with innovation specific to a buyer are more likely to share a common director with that buyer. This association is stronger when the buyer has a larger number of alternative suppliers. We further find that when a supplier–buyer pair shares a common director, the supplier's R&amp;D investment is more sensitive to the investment opportunities of its buyer. Moreover, such pairs tend to have longer supply chain relationships. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that board ties serve as a credible commitment mechanism to support exchange along the supply chain and safeguard suppliers' buyer‐specific investments.Managerial SummaryOur research shows that suppliers who create products or technologies tailored to a specific buyer are more likely to share a board member with that buyer. This relationship is stronger when the buyer has many other suppliers. Shared board members facilitate better communication and alignment between suppliers and buyers, leading to more effective R&amp;D investments and longer‐lasting business relationships. These ties help reduce the risk for suppliers when investing in customized solutions. For business leaders, strategically leveraging board connections can strengthen supply chain partnerships, promote collaborative innovation, and safeguard investments in buyer‐specific technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While prior research has examined organizational‐ and CEO‐level antecedents to mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) capabilities, less is known about how those below the CEO may shape the ways in which firms conduct acquisitions. In this study, I argue that Corporate Development Executives (CDEs), the specialized executives who lead M&amp;A efforts inside companies, also play an important role in the M&amp;A process. Through a hand‐collected dataset on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 information technology (IT) firms, I find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between their prior M&amp;A experience and subsequent M&amp;A performance, and I document the conditions under which CDEs' M&amp;A experience may complement or substitute that of the CEO and the firm. This study contributes to corporate strategy and organizational learning literatures by unveiling novel insights on the microfoundations of M&amp;A capabilities.Managerial SummaryCorporate Development Executives (CDEs) have become increasingly prevalent across organizations, yet their impact on M&amp;A outcomes remains less understood. This study investigates how these specialized executives responsible for leading M&amp;A inside organizations influence acquisition outcomes through their prior experience. Using detailed data on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 IT firms, I find an inverted‐U relationship between CDEs' prior M&amp;A experience and M&amp;A performance, and that their abilities to shape M&amp;A outcomes can be further enhanced or limited, depending on the experiences of the CEO and the firm. By unpacking the interactions among these different M&amp;A experiences, this work offers important managerial implications on how firms should select and manage their M&amp;A human capital as they continue to build M&amp;A capabilities in pursuit of superior firm performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using signaling theory, this research examines the role that social support during pregnancy plays in reducing work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave. Specifically, we consider four sources of social support (two from the work domain: supervisor and coworkers; and two from the non-work domain: spouse and friends) and the signaling effect they have on a mother’s work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave and her subsequent job and family satisfaction. Based on a sample of 247 women who completed surveys both before taking maternity leave and upon returning to the workforce, we found that supervisor, coworker, and friend support enhanced job satisfaction through reduced work-induced guilt. Further, both supervisor and spouse support contributed to family satisfaction through reduced family-induced guilt. Spouse support reduced family-induced guilt significantly more than coworker support, offering some modest support for domain specificity. Further, when considering the interaction of within-domain effects, we found that the work domain sources of support interact to provide a stronger effect on job satisfaction, but the non-work domain sources do not interact significantly. This provides an enlightening look at social support’s different roles in working mom guilt during a pivotal time in a woman’s life, her return to work after childbirth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market. (JEL G11, G12, G17)</content>

    <title>Capital Requirements with Non-Bank Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I quantitatively analyze the macroeconomic impacts of raising capital requirements in a model in which heterogeneous firms may choose either intermediated or direct finance. Heterogeneous banks compete with other banks and the bond market, fund loans with insured deposits and costly equity (subject to a minimum capital to asset ratio), and monitor borrowers. I find that tighter capital requirements reduce costly bank failures while having only small effects on key macroeconomic aggregates, and that raising capital requirements above current levels can be welfare-improving. Three main forces give rise to these results. First, even though banks cut loan supply for a given level of net worth under a tighter capital requirement, in equilibrium banks’ net worth rises to dampen this effect. Second, intense competition from the non-bank sector disciplines banks’ lending responses to tighter regulation. Third, substitution by corporate firms offsets much of the decline in debt financing associated with tighter bank loan supply. As a corollary, almost all of the modest costs associated with tighter capital requirements are concentrated within the bank-dependent non-corporate sector.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Introducing a new measure of scientific proximity between private firms and public research groups and exploiting a multi-billion euro financing program of academic clusters in France, we provide causal evidence of local spillovers from academic research to firms in the private sector. Our main estimate suggests that each euro spent in academic research through this program spurred an additional 0.81 euros in private R&amp;D expenditures. We also show that this shock increased the average quality of patents. We exploit reports produced by funded clusters, complemented by data on firm creation, labor mobility and R&amp;D public–private partnerships, to provide evidence on the channels for these spillovers. We discuss the policy implications of funding academic research to stimulate private R&amp;D.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some Bilinear Optimization Problems Are Surprisingly Easy to SolveBilinear terms in a continuous optimization problem are computationally challenging and are typically addressed with global optimization techniques or McCormick-based relaxations. In “Hidden convexity in a class of optimization problems with bilinear terms,” Gorissen, den Hertog, and Reusken discover a reformulation technique that provides an equivalent convex formulation that is solvable in polynomial time for a rich subclass of problems. The subclass is characterized by products of variables where one variable is nonnegative and the other variable interacts only with variables that are multiplied with the same nonnegative variable. Their finding provides a new avenue to efficiently solve inverse optimization problems, nonlinear robust optimization problems via their dual problem, and problems with variable coefficients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how variations in nonfinancial terms across bonds from the same issuer, referred to as “issuer term variability” (ITV), relate to bond yield spreads, returns, and investor bases. Our findings show that ITV is positively associated with yield spreads, even after accounting for the issuer’s credit ratings and other credit risk proxies. Additionally, bonds with high ITV exhibit greater default risk but deliver lower risk-adjusted returns compared with those with low ITV. We also find that yield-seeking investors are more likely to own bonds with high ITV, and bond funds that reach for yield also tend to favor high ITV bonds. These results suggest that some investors specifically target high ITV bonds to achieve higher yields, even at the cost of lower returns. Further analysis indicates that reaching for ITV is difficult to justify as rational risk-taking by constrained investors.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01876 .</content>

    <title>Learning to Price Supply Chain Contracts Against a Learning Retailer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of big data analytics has automated the decision-making of companies and increased supply chain agility. In this paper, we study the supply chain contract design problem faced by a data-driven supplier (she) who needs to respond to the inventory decisions of the downstream retailer (he). Both the supplier and the retailer are uncertain about the market demand and need to learn about it sequentially over a fixed time horizon. In addition, the supplier does not know the retailer’s inventory learning policy, which may change dynamically. The goal for the supplier is to develop data-driven pricing policies with sublinear regret bounds under a wide range of possible retailer inventory learning policies. To capture the dynamics induced by the retailer’s inventory learning policy, we establish a connection with nonstationary online learning by following the notion of a variation budget. We start by making the observation that existing approaches for nonstationary online learning cannot precisely delineate the dynamics incurred by the retailer’s inventory learning policy, and may lead to linear growth in the supplier’s regret under some well-known retailer inventory learning policies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new notion of variation budget, which better quantifies the impact of the retailer’s learning on the supplier’s decision-making environment. We also demonstrate the advantages of our new model for the variation budget in our setting over those in the existing literature. We then proceed to propose dynamic pricing policies for the supplier for both discrete and continuous demand distributions. Our pricing policies lead to sublinear regret bounds for the supplier under a wide range of retailer inventory learning policies. Our pricing policies empirically outperform those from the existing nonstationary online learning literature. At the managerial level, we answer affirmatively that there is a pricing policy with a sublinear regret bound for the supplier under a wide range of retailer inventory learning policies, even though she faces a learning retailer and an unknown demand distribution. Our work also provides a novel perspective in data-driven operations management where the principal has to learn to react to the learning policies employed by other agents in the system.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03339 .</content>

    <title>A Method for Asynchronous Time Series Analysis with Marketing Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many time series data evolve asynchronously. In marketing, for example, we observe ad liking every second, hourly clickstreams, daily sales, weekly brand awareness, or monthly ad expenditures. Thus, the question arises: how to estimate dynamic models when metrics evolve at different frequencies? To this end, we develop a new method for estimation and inference of state space models for asynchronous data. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed method does not require any data preprocessing to align frequencies. We derive the optimal gain factor from first principles and demonstrate in three simulation studies that the new method recovers model parameters as accurately as the full-information Kalman filter as if all data were available. This finding holds across various degrees of noise levels and data sparsity. More importantly, we show that ignoring data asynchronicity results in substantially biased parameter estimates. Empirically, we illustrate the efficacy of the new method via two applications: copy testing of an advertisement and a marketing mix model, both with asynchronous data. It yields meaningful results compared with those obtained by aligning asynchronous data to the slowest frequency (i.e., data aggregation). In the marketing mix application, for example, data aggregation produces erroneously insignificant estimates of sales carryover and TV effectiveness, and these become significant when we apply the new method. These biased estimates can have serious managerial consequences. Thus, the proposed method paves the way to analyze asynchronous time series data: slow- or fast-moving dependent variables, slow- or fast-moving independent variables, and all of them at equal or unequal frequencies.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Marketing Science Institute [Grant 4-1959].

    <title>Dynamic Control of a Make-to-Order System Under Model Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deriving control policies for a make-to-order manufacturing system is often predicated on a well-specified probabilistic model that governs demand realization. In practice, however, such a model may be a simplification of the actual scenario because of tractability considerations. Consequently, policies obtained under such simplifications may perform poorly if the assumed model does not accurately capture reality. In this paper, we propose a modeling paradigm that can generate control policies based on a simplified model, accounting for possible model errors that may result. The make-to-order system offers multiple products and has an outsourcing mechanism. Our focus is on addressing deliberate model simplification for the demand realization process. We formulate a robust control problem that takes the form of a two-player, zero-sum game. Because the original formulation is not tractable enough, we further develop an approximating problem under the heavy-traffic assumption that effectively results in a stochastic differential game. The solution to this game then translates into an implementable control policy for the original make-to-order system. We supplement the proposed modeling paradigm with a simulation-based method for selecting an appropriate uncertainty set. Numerical experiments expose, among other things, the value of building robustness into decision making.This paper was accepted by Barış Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the spread of misinformation on centralized social media platforms has received significant attention, few studies compare centralized and decentralized platforms, and how to mitigate misinformation diffusion in newly emerging blockchain‐based decentralized social network platforms. We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent‐based simulations leveraging real‐world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measured as yield spreads against Treasury securities and AAA corporate bonds, the convenience premium of newly issued agency MBS averages more than half of the long-term Treasury convenience premium. The agency MBS convenience premium and issuance amount vary negatively with mortgage rate, consistent with a prepayment-driven channel. Placing agencies into conservatorship in 2008 and introducing liquidity regulations in 2013 significantly affected MBS convenience premium, consistent with government guarantee and regulatory treatment channels. Analyses of dispersion of dealers’ prepayment forecasts, seasoned MBS, and investors’ MBS holdings deliver further economic implications for agency MBS as safe assets.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate investors’ disagreement regarding firm news and assess its ability to predict stock returns. Specifically, we quantify firm-level investor disagreement through the volume-volatility elasticity surrounding firm news; higher elasticity is associated with less investor disagreement. Intuitively, disagreement introduces additional trading motives that are not driven by price changes, weakening the connection between volume and volatility. Our findings indicate that investor disagreement on news negatively predicts cross-sectional returns. We also present empirical evidence aligned with the theoretical predictions of a recently developed model by Atmaz and Basak (Journal of Finance 73 (3): 1225–1279 2018) that the negative disagreement-stock relation strengthens when the optimism effect dominates the uncertainty effect. Importantly, this predictive relationship remains robust after controlling for news heterogeneity, other volume- and volatility-based measures, and alternative channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how global changes in information acquisition costs through disclosure technologies affect price informativeness. To explore this issue, we examine worldwide adoptions of centralized electronic disclosure systems, which significantly reduce the cost of and broaden access to financial disclosures. Consistent with theory, we show a significant reduction in private information acquisition around earnings announcements as a result of these adoptions. These effects are most pronounced in countries with the most substantial reductions in information acquisition costs and where we find more significant decreases in informed trade. Overall, we highlight an important, unintended cost of broadening access to financial disclosures through technology adoptions.</content>

    <title>Distributional Growth Accounting: Education and the Reduction of Global Poverty, 1980-2019</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the role played by education in the reduction of global poverty. I propose tools for identifying the contribution of schooling to economic growth by income group, integrating imperfect substitution between skill groups into macroeconomic growth decomposition. I bring this “distributional growth accounting” framework to the data by exploiting a new microdatabase representative of nearly all of the world’s population, new estimates of the private returns to schooling, and historical income distribution statistics. Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education. Because they ignore the distributional effects of schooling, standard growth accounting methods substantially underestimate economic benefits of education for the global poor.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To realize complementary value in ecosystems, organizations engage in architectural learning, which involves searching for interdependencies and specifying interactions with external complements. In this article, we explore how this process differs when potential complements are not yet fully interoperable and complementarity is emergent. We report on a longitudinal case study of a 3D printer company that shifted from producing inexpensive personal desktop 3D printers to the professional 3D printing ecosystem. The company intensively used proxies (stand-in components) to support learning about interdependencies with potential external complements. This process informed internal component adaptations and the design of boundary resources that enabled third-party complementors to make their components fully complementary. From this case, we theorize this process in terms of shaping a complementarity space: a problem space in which organizations iteratively draw on proxies to provide resources such as interfaces and tools to transfer complementary capabilities to other organizations. We discuss theoretical implications for research on architectural learning and ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multilocation, Dynamic Staff Planning for a Healthcare System: Methodology and ApplicationThis study develops and implements a robust optimization model for dynamically assigning anesthesiologists across multiple hospitals in a large health system. The model addresses uncertainty in surgical demand by incorporating a three-stage decision process: presurgical location assignments, midhorizon on-call deployment, and day-of realization of overtime or idleness. The authors formulate the problem as a multistage robust mixed-integer program and solve it efficiently using a novel nested column and constraint generation algorithm. The approach accounts for location-specific constraints and fairness in on-call duties using historical data to estimate demand uncertainty with a calibrated trade-off between optimality and robustness. Implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the model reduced annual staffing costs by 12% or roughly $800,000 compared to existing practice. The framework is generalizable to other staffing problems in healthcare and provides operational insights on the value of forecast accuracy, location flexibility, and equitable workload distribution.</content>

    <title>Eliciting Advice Instead of Feedback Improves Developmental Input</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most organizations encourage employees to provide feedback to one another to support learning, personal growth, and career advancement. However, employee feedback often fails to improve performance because it lacks concrete, specific guidance. We provide a temporal explanation for why workplace input processes routinely fail to produce valuable and concrete developmental insights: they are insufficiently focused on the future. In this paper, we theorize and demonstrate that encouraging input providers to think about the future leads them to produce more concrete developmental input. Across a large scale, preregistered field experiment (n = 27,432 comments) and two laboratory studies (n = 806), people provide more concrete and actionable developmental input when they are prompted to provide future-looking “advice” rather than “feedback,” a common method of soliciting input in organizations. The effect of soliciting advice on input concreteness was mediated by providers’ future focus. Moreover, in a follow-up study, such concrete input was assessed by independent raters as more useful. These findings highlight the role of temporal orientation in driving the content of developmental input. In doing so, our data suggest that individuals and organizations have the potential to promote higher-quality developmental input by attending to the temporal orientation that their input systems encourage.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: Funding for the laboratory experiments was provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03207 .</content>

    <title>Reducing Racial Disparities in Consumer Credit: Evidence from Anonymous Loan Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a unique experiment of anonymizing online loan applications to test whether race-blind screening procedures reduce racial disparities in consumer credit. With names on applications, minority applicants are 10% less likely to receive online loan offers and receive worse offer terms than otherwise identical majority applicants. Anonymizing applications reduces such disparities substantially. High-income minority applicants benefit more than low-income minorities. We show that the racial disparities are not driven by differences in credit demand. Overall, anonymous loan applications reduce racial disparities in access to credit by increasing lender reliance on objective credit risk measures.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This research is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its Social Science Research Thematic Grant [Grant MOE2019-SSRTG-024].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the roles of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists (VCs), and the government in financing fundamental innovations, defined as those with a positive social value net of development costs but often with negative net present values to innovating firms, for example, a vaccine against COVID-19. We first analyze the case where the entrepreneur, with or without VC financing, develops innovations. We then analyze government support of innovation and the government’s choice between subsidies and innovation prizes. We further analyze the optimal interactions between government and VC financing, showing that the government may optimally channel subsidies partially through VCs, thus rationalizing government-funded VCs. Overall, our paper provides a framework for the optimal choice of sectors and technologies to receive government support (e.g., subsidies included in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022) and how any government support should be structured to best motivate innovation.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a second-price auction with a flexible reserve price, where the reserve price for the top bidder is not fixed but rather determined as a function of all losing bids. We show that when bidders are ex ante heterogeneous, a second-price auction with an optimally chosen flexible reserve price not only generates strictly higher expected revenue than that of a second-price auction with any fixed reserve price but is also revenue-maximizing among all mechanisms that implement discrimination-free social choice functions. We also provide an axiomatic characterization of all second-price auctions with a flexible reserve price. Finally, we discuss real-life implementation.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Oesterreichische Nationalbank [Grant 19021] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72203148].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04584 .</content>

    <title>Too Good To Go: Combating Food Waste with Surprise Clearance</title>
    <updated>2025-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies surprise clearance as an innovative business model to increase store profit and reduce food waste. A store holding surprise clearance sells “surprise bags” composed of surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. At the time of ordering, consumers are uncertain about the quantity of food items included in a surprise bag. We model surprise clearance and compare it with both no clearance and transparent clearance, which sets a transparent unit clearance price based on the amount of surplus food after regular sales. We find that surprise clearance achieves the highest store profit and induces the most store production among the three selling schemes. Although both clearance schemes have the ability to eliminate store waste, the store effectively does so under surprise clearance but deliberately does not under transparent clearance. In fact, transparent clearance may generate even more store waste than no clearance. Further, both clearance schemes exacerbate the problem of consumer waste compared with no clearance, and despite zero store waste, surprise clearance generates the most consumer waste among the three schemes. If clearance sales target a consumer segment with a sufficiently low valuation of consumption, both clearance schemes reduce total waste, and surprise clearance is a win-win-win solution that maximizes store profit and social welfare and minimizes total waste among the three schemes. However, there are circumstances under which both clearance schemes fail to reduce total waste, and surprise clearance may generate the most total waste.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: L.

    <title>Setting the Stage: Line Managers' &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Orientation as an Antecedent to Perceived &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The field of strategic human resource (HR) management has shown an increasing focus on how employees perceive and react to their organization's HR practices. In this perspective, employees are not passive recipients of HR policies or mere observers of their managers' HR implementation strategies. Rather, their perceptions play a critical role in shaping organizational culture and fostering high‐performing workplaces. However, important questions remain regarding how line management roles shape not only employees' assessments of their work environment but also their perceptions of HR effectiveness. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, we argue that line managers' compliance‐ versus commitment‐focused orientations influence employee appraisals of threats and challenges in their jobs. These appraisals, in turn, shape how employees evaluate the effectiveness of their organization's HR practices (i.e., perceived HR effectiveness). Using qualitative data from focus groups and a multilevel quantitative research design, we find evidence supporting our hypotheses, showing that line managers' HR orientations significantly influence employees' cognitive appraisals and subsequent perceptions of HR effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical contributions and offering practical recommendations for improving the implementation of HR practices.</content>

    <title>Does Tax-Benefit Linkage Matter for the Incidence of Payroll Taxes?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze earnings responses to six large payroll tax and income tax reforms in France. Our findings indicate full pass-through to workers when there is a strong and transparent link between contributions and expected benefits. In contrast, employer payroll taxes with no tax-benefit linkage exhibit limited pass-through to workers, while income tax nominally borne by employees show nearly full pass-through. Together with a meta-analysis of the literature, we interpret these results as empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that tax-benefit linkage matters for the incidence of payroll taxes. In the absence of such linkage, our findings suggest that the individual-level incidence of payroll taxes aligns with their statutory incidence.</content>

    <title>Virtually Even: Status Equalizing in Distributed Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In distributed organizations, perceived status differences between workers are ubiquitous and harmful. Yet research suggests that once they are formed, status beliefs in organizations become entrenched in hierarchies and are hard to dismantle. In an inductive qualitative study, we observed how established status differences between remote and in-person workers in distributed organizations dissolved during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone began working remotely. We use these data to theorize a novel status-equalizing process through which remote workers came to see themselves on an “equal playing field” with their in-person peers. We theorize how this status equalizing occurred through workers’ changing their “in-person default” use of technology—that is, their new behavior challenged embedded cultural practices that had treated the in-person workplace experience as the standard, normal, and valued perspective, implicitly guiding how employees used technology. Workers adopted new and more inclusive technology practices—including the use of asynchronous communication, greater codification of work, and virtual socializing—which resulted in remote workers perceiving new and more equal communication standards, access to information, and opportunity for social connection. As a result, these workers reported feeling less negatively stereotyped and treated more fairly in their virtual interactions with colleagues, fostering feelings of inclusion and deepening relationships across the previously established status divide. At a time when many organizations are grappling with the challenges of distributed, remote, and hybrid work, our research illuminates how inclusive technology practices can help nullify entrenched status imbalances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bayesian Learning for Data-Driven Stochastic Optimal ControlStochastic optimal control (SOC) provides a principled approach to dynamic decision making under uncertainty. It models the transition of the system state with a dynamic equation driven by randomness, with the assumption that the distribution of randomness is known. However, in practical problems, modeling randomness frequently depends on data or observations, which introduces uncertainty regarding the distribution of randomness. To address the data-driven SOC problem, in “Episodic Bayesian Optimal Control with Unknown Randomness Distributions,” Shapiro, Zhou, Lin, and Wang propose a new approach that incorporates Bayesian learning with optimal control in an episodic manner. They show the convergence and convergence rate results for their approach. They also develop an efficient computational method for a class of problems that have convex cost functions and linear state dynamics.</content>

    <title>Closer to Home: A Structural Estimate-Then-Optimize Approach to Improve Access to Healthcare Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geographic inequalities in healthcare access extend beyond rural–urban divides to include socioeconomic, racial, and other disparities. Proximity to hospitals, clinics, healthcare providers, and pharmacies varies widely, posing a challenge in deciding where to strategically locate such facilities. Demand for each service depends on local population health, individual preferences, provider capacity, and other factors. This study introduces a novel structural estimate-then-optimize (SETO) framework, combining structural demand estimation using a modified Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes approach that accounts for provider capacity with a choice-based optimal facility location model to maximize health service utilization. Our methodology is illustrated with a case study on the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program in California, a public–private partnership that administered millions of COVID-19 vaccinations. Demand estimates indicate that residents of socioeconomically vulnerable communities are more sensitive to travel distances to pharmacy-based vaccination sites. Strategically adding 500 retail stores serving lower-income communities increases predicted vaccinations by 2.9% overall (770,000 additional vaccinations statewide) and by 5.3% in the least healthy neighborhoods. Our integrative SETO approach outperforms heuristics that allocate resources based on current vaccination rates, existing service gaps, population density, or predicted demand. The case study demonstrates the importance of (1) accounting for heterogeneity in estimating demand and (2) selecting partnerships to complement existing networks with spatially heterogeneous supply and efficiently fill service gaps. Our study provides a systematic approach to optimize healthcare delivery networks, using publicly available aggregate data while accounting for individuals’ preferences, highlighting the value of combining a structural demand model with prescriptive analytics.This paper was accepted by Stefan Sholtes, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06274 .</content>

    <title>Unbottling Time: Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty and ‘Time‐Less Organizing’ at a Bottled Water Plant Occupation in Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how Indigenous Zapatista‐influenced activists enact temporal sovereignty to resist corporate water extraction, challenging dominant Western organizational temporalities. Through qualitative in‐person research of the 2021 occupation of a water bottling plant in Mexico, I explore how activists transformed the site into a non‐capitalist communal space, creating alternative temporal rhythms rooted in Zapatista principles such as ‘walking at the pace of the slowest’ and collective autonomy. The findings reveal how activists rejected efficiency‐driven deadlines, prioritized ecological cycles over productivity metrics, and fostered relational well‐being through inclusive decision‐making. These practices culminated in what I conceptualize as ‘time‐less organizing’ – a framework for non‐capitalist horizontal organizing that operates outside conventional time logics. The study contributes to the management and organizing literature by theorizing temporal sovereignty as resistance to imposed temporalities, extending critiques of stakeholder theory by exposing how corporate temporal constraints perpetuate marginalization, and demonstrating how communities reclaim autonomy through alternative temporal practices. The findings challenge assumptions of time as a resource to be managed for efficiency gains, offering future avenues of research for addressing grand challenges through decelerated and relational approaches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We note that while the institutional environment determines the actions and structures of constituent organizations, there are still limited insights available in the literature on the nature and process of interactions between key stakeholders in ambulance services, especially as they respond during a significant crisis. This study specifically examines how a positive social exchange between senior leadership, managers, and frontline staff, accompanied by changes to the leadership style and HR practices, resulted in significant service transformation. An in‐depth qualitative case study design was used to interview 52 frontline staff and leaders from the UK National Health Service's (NHS) Ambulance Service over a prolonged period of 8 months (October 2020 to May 2021). Interviews and secondary data were abductively analyzed, showing how changes to HRM and leadership practices shaped service transformation's content, process, and logic. The findings suggest that an iterative social exchange between the key social actors in the Ambulance Trust led to adaptations to the nature of HRM and leadership practices, which positively impacted the changes to service delivery, leading to service transformation and improved health and well‐being of paramedics. Our conceptual framework contributes to the literature by integrating how the use of agency, new HRM, and leadership practices in the context of institutionalized structures can result in service transformation. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the dynamics of information demand and supply in capital markets, focusing on how firms’ disclosures align with analysts’ information needs. Using a novel dataset from Visible Alpha, we analyze granular data from analysts’ forecasting models to understand the breadth of information they seek and how firms meet these demands through mandatory and voluntary disclosures. We document significant variation in the complexity of analysts’ models and the extent of firms’ disclosures, leading to some items in analysts’ models remaining undisclosed. This unmet information demand gives rise to a novel concept we term “uncertainty about the past” (UP). We investigate its implications for key capital market outcomes, including analyst forecast dispersion, market reactions to earnings announcements, and stock market liquidity. Our results demonstrate thatUPplays a significant role in shaping the information environment, challenging the assumption that earnings announcements fully resolve uncertainty about past performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an economics-based review of the pros and cons of ESG disclosures, emphasizing environmental disclosures from an investor-centric perspective. Our survey intends to guide corporate management and regulators in navigating the ESG disclosure terrain. Rather than summarizing the vast and growing ESG literature, we assess the economic arguments for ESG disclosure regulation and the form of this disclosure. We discuss investors’ demand for ESG information and its supply by publicly traded firms. We analyze the case for and against mandatory ESG disclosure. Finally, we weigh the efficiency of disclosure requirement characteristics, assuming mandatory ESG disclosure is warranted. We intend to be positive rather than prescriptive, providing a line of reasoning readers can employ to reach their own conclusions about what we ought to do.</content>

    <title>Is the Price Right? The Role of Economic Trade-Offs in Explaining Reactions to Price Surges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public authorities often introduce price controls following price surges, potentially causing inefficiencies and exacerbating shortages. A survey experiment with 7,612 Canadian and U.S. respondents shows that unregulated price surges raise moral objections and widespread disapproval. However, acceptance increases and demand for regulation declines when participants are prompted to consider economic trade-offs between controlled and unregulated prices, whereby incentives from higher prices lead to additional supply and enhance access to goods. Moreover, highlighting these trade-offs reduces polarization in moral judgments between supporters and opponents of unregulated pricing. Textual analysis of responses to open-ended questions provides further insights into our findings, and an incentivized donation task demonstrates consistency between stated preferences and real-stakes behavior. Although economic trade-offs do influence public support for price control policies, the evidence indicates that even when the potential gains in economic efficiency from unregulated prices are explicit, a significant divide persists between the utilitarian views that standard economic thinking implies and the nonutilitarian values held by the general population.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Johns Hopkins “Catalyst Award” and Business of Health Initiative (HBHI) and the Sandra Rotman Centre for Health Sector Strategy at the University of Toronto.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04555 .</content>

    <title>The Power of Disagreement: A Field Experiment to Investigate Human–Algorithm Collaboration in Loan Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human–algorithm collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in the economy and society. However, this collaboration is not always fruitful, and in extreme cases, people become human borgs or totally averse to algorithms. The key to collaborative value is whether humans and algorithms can complement each other in decision making, but it is challenging for humans to disagree with algorithmic recommendations at the right time (i.e., to disagree when algorithms are wrong and not disagree when algorithms are right). To understand the centric role of disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration and examine when and how it benefits, we conducted a field experiment in which human evaluators and algorithms worked together to evaluate loan applications under four scenarios, that is, limited/rich information and with/without disclosure of algorithm rationale. Our results show that human–algorithm collaboration decisions outperformed human- or algorithm-only decisions, and these collaborative values varied across the four scenarios. We further propose a theoretical framework for mechanism examination that centers on the formation and effectiveness of disagreement. We validate the framework empirically and come to the following findings: (1) disagreement exhibits a sizable and nonlinear influence on collaborative value, (2) the differences between human evaluators and algorithms in decision making contribute to disagreement but not to collaborative value, (3) algorithm self-contradiction triggers disagreement and helps human evaluators disagree with algorithms at the right time. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights on how collaborative value is achieved and managerial insights on how to manage disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration.This paper has been accepted by Hemant Bhargava for the Special Issue on The Human–Algorithm Connection.Funding: Y.

    <title>Rethinking How We Theorize &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; in Organization and Management: A Problematizing Review of Rationality and Anthropomorphism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has long held the promise of imitating, replacing, or even surpassing human intelligence. Now that the abilities of AI systems have started to approach this initial aspiration, organization and management scholars face a challenge in how to theorize this technology, which potentially changes the way we view technology: not as a tool, but as something that enters previously human‐only domains. To navigate this theorizing challenge, we adopt the problematizing review method by engaging in a selective and critical reading of the theoretical contributions regarding AI, in the most influential organization and management journals. We examine how the literature has grounded itself with AI as the root metaphor and what field assumptions about AI are shared – or contested – in the field. We uncover two core assumptions of rationality and anthropomorphism, around which fruitful debates are already emerging. We discuss these two assumptions and their organizational boundary conditions in the context of theorizing AI. Finally, we invite scholars to build distinctive organization and management theory scaffolding within the broader social science of AI.</content>

    <title>Do Gender-Role Violations in Initiating Structure and Consideration Help or Harm Employee Stress and Well-Being?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has noted the stress-reducing effects of leaders’ initiating structure and consideration, these behaviors are often gendered, with initiating structure as agentic, masculine behavior and consideration as communal, feminine behavior. Given these gender-role expectations, we examine whether there are different implications of women and men leaders’ initiating structure and consideration in relation to employee stress and well-being. Integrating expectancy violation theory and stress appraisal theory, we argue that perceived leader behaviors that violate gender roles (i.e., initiating structure by women leaders and consideration by men leaders) will be more powerful in reducing employee threat appraisals, which then reduces self-regulation depletion and in turn enriches employee well-being. Two studies—a time-separated field study and a set of experiments—support our proposals. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A substantial body of research highlights how stringent regulations disrupt innovators’ incentives and increase transaction costs, yet their information processing implication remains understudied. Building on information processing theory, we study how the interplay between formal and informal institutions shapes inventors’ information processing in developing artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. We examine the effect of stringent privacy regulations on AI innovation by exploiting the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) announcement. We argue that, following the GDPR announcement, GDPR-affected countries experience lower national AI innovation rates than unaffected countries. Further, we postulate that this negative effect is weaker in GDPR-affected countries, marked by higher levels of individualism, masculinity, and indulgence, but stronger in the affected countries with higher levels of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and long-term orientation. Our difference-in-differences analysis supports the proposed framework. Our research contributes to the international business literature by developing novel theoretical predictions at the intersection of comparative institutional analysis and national culture, explaining how privacy protection laws and cultural factors shape AI inventors’ information processing. Finally, this study provides insights into how inventors and entrepreneurs in countries with stringent privacy laws can leverage national culture to shape their AI innovation strategies and inform strategic decision-making.</content>

    <title>The Marketplace of Existential Authenticity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditionally, being authentic is regarded as something one is, where an entity is judged to possess the appropriate ‘authenticity’ attributes independently acquired outside of marketplace pressures. We consider two factors that challenge this traditional view to arrive at an alternative view of authenticity. First, we draw on existentialism that describes authenticity as a process of self-creation that occurs in interaction with others. Second, we consider neoliberal ideology whereby consumers are regarded as fully immersed market actors. By examining social media influencers (SMIs) who foster authenticity with overt marketization efforts, we identify a marketplace of existential authenticity where public performances of self-creation by an SMI are accompanied by resolute vulnerability that is valorized as work, thus warranting monetization. This cultural space of existentialism, where authenticity is something one does (vs. something one is), is governed by a ‘reflexive synopticon:’ a form of governmentality that shapes the actions of participants (SMIs, audience members, and the social media platform) through their mutual reflection on each other. Our work articulates how neoliberal horizontal governmentality structures operate, which includes the enabling (vs. antagonistic) role of the market. Moreover, our findings emphasize the culturally bound nature of different types of authenticities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice-oriented abstractThis study investigates how actively engaging potential backers through timely responses in campaign discussion boards influences fundraising success on reward-based crowdfunding platforms. Our findings reveal several critical implications. First, responses from campaign starters significantly attract new contributors. Second, starter response amplifies the “herding effect,” where the number of pledged backers attracts more new backers. Last, although achieving funding goals typically reduces momentum, we find that ongoing engagement via active response to backer comments mitigates this decline and sustains backer interest. Practically, fundraisers should actively manage discussions to signal trustworthiness, commitment, and manage expectations. Platforms can enhance communication effectiveness by summarizing key discussion sentiments, highlighting frequent topics, and integrating tools like live chat to foster efficient real-time communication. Adopting these practices can significantly enhance crowdfunding effectiveness and sustainability.</content>

    <title>Does Social Bot Help Socialize? Evidence from a Microblogging Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging advancements in large language models, social media platforms are increasingly deploying sophisticated chatbots, termed social bots, with the potential to stimulate user interaction. However, concerns linger regarding the socializing value of these bots in public settings. We investigate this phenomenon using data from the launch of CommentRobot on a microblogging platform. Analyzing user interactions with this platform-owned bot, we find that posts receiving bot-generated comments experience increased user engagement, demonstrating the socializing value of social bots at the post level. Results from an online experiment confirm this finding and reveal that the socializing value stems from both bot identity and high-quality content. Mechanism tests suggest that the quality of bot-generated comments—particularly their attractiveness, relevance, and inclusion of social cues—significantly influences user engagement. Moreover, we evaluate existing bot targeting strategies and propose policy learning-based improvements to optimize engagement. Despite the positive impact on post-level engagement, we find that receiving bot comments primarily encourages future bot-related posts rather than increasing overall user posting activity, contrary to platform expectations. Our findings highlight the need for platforms to refine social bot deployment strategies to maximize user engagement while mitigating unintended consequences.</content>

    <title>Emotionality in Political Social Media Communications: The Moderating Role of Audience Diversity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Politicians are increasingly turning to social media to engage with the public. At a time marked by extreme partisanship, rhetoric is often emotionally charged. But does this help or hinder efforts to engage followers and attract new ones? Our research examines how the emotionality of U.S. senators’ tweets affects both engagement (e.g., shares) and follower growth. Although emotional posts can increase engagement, this effect diminishes for senators from ideologically diverse battleground states, especially when the emotion is negative. For diverse constituencies, less emotional content may actually lead to greater engagement. Although emotionality can fuel engagement, it is the substantive content of posts that drives follower growth. These findings have implications for political discourse and communication strategy. Although intensely emotional and negative posts may energize a homogeneous base, they can alienate broader audiences and do not attract new followers. Beyond politics, content creators must be mindful of audience heterogeneity and be judicious in the use of emotionally charged messaging.</content>

However, how ecosystems emerge and evolve remains unexplored. In a question‐based examination of the solar photovoltaic ecosystem, we observe that ecosystems emerge earlier than predicted through the “transfer” of ecosystem elements, in a process of “re‐specialization,” and ecosystem roles from adjacent ecosystems. Second, the larger ecosystem has a unique life cycle, expanding while the focal industry contracts. Third, variance in institutional regime logic and orientation shapes where and how ecosystems evolve. Finally, bottlenecks shape ecosystem evolution, leading to an expansion in the bottleneck element through both new entry and migration from other ecosystem areas.Managerial AbstractInnovation ecosystems, or the larger group of firms producing components and complements, play a pivotal role in the ability of firms to create value with an innovation.

    <title>Yes, We (Still) Can! A Qualitative Study on the Dynamic Process of Team Resilience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on psychological resilience in the workplace is on the rise, aiming to better understand how to successfully manage adverse events. Although scholars have started to explore the concept of team resilience, the focus of the theory on team resilience has been largely on cognitive mechanisms. However, neglecting the role of relational mechanisms discounts the collaboration and social interaction that are necessary for successful teamwork, especially in the face of adverse events. To address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study with a palliative care team that experienced work-related adverse events. Based on our data and applying conservation of resources theory, we develop a process model of team resilience. This model specifies the experience of adverse events as loss events and illustrates how teams can counteract these losses and enact team resilience through the relational process of caring. Caring in teams can be enacted through four dimensions, which we refer to as understanding, being with, doing for, and enabling. By enacting these caring dimensions, teams can heal social safety and collective action capabilities and can moreover build valuable resources, which may buffer resource loss and fuel resource growth in subsequent team resilience episodes. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of relational processes in team resilience enactment and specify caring as a core relational mechanism that enables team resilient outcomes. Overall, we provide a nuanced understanding of the different elements within a team resilience process.</content>

    <title>Shades of Grey or Black and White? How Entrepreneurs’ Use of Cognitively Complex Language Affects Investor Funding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how entrepreneurs’ use of cognitively complex language—language that involves nuance, differentiation, and comparison—influences funding decisions of early-stage investors. Our theorizing builds on the notion that individuals interpret language as a social signal and attribute another person’s language use to that person’s general dispositions. On this basis, we surmise that investors perceive an entrepreneur as more cognitively complex—that is, engaging in more nuanced and differentiated thinking—the more the entrepreneur uses cognitively complex language. Arguing that perceived cognitive complexity matches investors’ prototypical construals of entrepreneurial competence, we hypothesize a positive relationship between an entrepreneur’s use of cognitively complex language and the investment amount they receive. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we also argue that signaling cognitive complexity has a decreasing marginal effect, and that elite education functions as a credibility signal, amplifying the association between cognitively complex language and investment amount. A field study of 547 actual investment pitches and a randomized experiment with 240 professionals support our ideas. Our study introduces a more nuanced portrayal of complexity in entrepreneurial communication, accentuates the role of entrepreneurs’ signals of cognitive dispositions, and introduces the concept of cognitive complexity, and linguistic displays thereof, to entrepreneurship theory.</content>

    <title>The Role of Taxes in the Rise of ETFs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that a lesser known yet economically significant tax-deferral feature of ETFs’ security design is crucial to their success. By relying on the in-kind redemption exemption, authorized participants help ETFs avoid distributing capital gains and reduce their tax overhang, partly by deploying heartbeat trades. We estimate that the ETF tax efficiency has increased long-term investors’ after-tax returns by 1.05% per year relative to mutual funds in recent years. Exploiting cross-sectional and time-series variations in investors’ tax burden, we show that tax efficiency is a significant driver of capital migration by high-net-worth investors from mutual funds into ETFs.

    <title>Bargaining Foundations for the Outside Option Principle</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a bargaining game in which a seller can trade with one of two buyers, who have values h and l (h &amp;gt; l). The outside option principle (OOP) predicts that the seller trades with the high-value buyer with probability converging to 1 at a price converging to max (h/2,l) as players become patient. While this prediction is supported by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), a wide range of trading outcomes may emerge in subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs): in the patient limit, the seller can obtain any price in the interval [h/2,h] (and no other); moreover, allocative inefficiency and costly delay are possible. We propose equilibrium refinements less restrictive than Markov behavior that guarantee trading outcomes consistent with the OOP. One refinement requires that a buyer's relative probability of trade does not increase dramatically following a failed negotiation with that buyer. Another refinement posits that the seller does not approach a buyer hoping that negotiations fail. SPEs satisfying both refinements conform with the OOP (but need not be MPEs). Our benchmark model features strategic matching by the seller. We provide a parallel analysis for the random matching protocol. Under random matching, prices in SPEs may also rise above and fall below l, but have a narrower range. A refinement particular to this protocol that restores the OOP requires that a random mismatch should not impact the seller excessively.</content>

    <title>Legislators’ demand for firms’ financial statements: evidence from U.S. congressional redistricting events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether U.S. House representatives and their staff seek financial information from constituent firms to inform their legislative decisions. We exploit shifts in U.S. congressional districts (i.e., the reconfiguration of federal district lines or redistricting) that introduce new constituent firms to legislators’ districts. To the extent that legislators and their staff collect and rely on firms’ financial statement information, we expect that a change in representation as a result of redistricting will result in a significant and observable change in searches for information about new constituent firms. Our evidence supports this prediction. We also find that the timing of searching coincides with legislators’ roll call votes, particularly ahead of more controversial bills and for bills lobbied by sample firms. Finally, we find that new constituent firms respond to increased information demands after a redistricting event by supplying more policy-relevant disclosures and increasing lobbying.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint Shelf Design and Space Planning Problem with Placement Options</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sandra Zajac, Heinrich Kuhn</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces the first joint shelf design and space planning problem that considers two placement options for items – hanging and shelving – on flexible shelves. These types of shelves are used in sectors such as do-it-yourself and toy retail, and for household goods in grocery stores. However, they have received limited attention in the literature, which typically focuses on regular shelves with a single placement option: placing items on shelf panels. The problem requires three interdependent decisions: (1) the placement option for each item (shelving or hanging), (2) the shelf design (number and vertical positioning of shelf panels), and (3) the shelf space planning (assignment of facings as well as the vertical and horizontal positioning of items). We formalize this problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop a greedy multi-start matheuristic to efficiently solve practical instances. Computational experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms both a commercial solver and a benchmark method for two-dimensional shelf space planning in terms of runtime and solution quality.A comprehensive analysis of synthetic instances and a real-world case study provides several managerial insights. First, hanging items enables more flexible use of shelf space, which is especially beneficial when item variety is high. However, when large vertical grabbing gaps must be considered, stacking items on shelf panels may be more advantageous. In turn, there is a risk of wasted space due to height or width mismatches. Second, the number and size of the segments on the shelf significantly influence layout profitability, highlighting the need to jointly optimize shelf design and space allocation. Third, it is common practice to arrange hanging items in horizontal rows, which can be facilitated by segmenting the shelf space. While this improves visual appeal, increasing the number of segments tends to reduce overall space utilization and profitability. Finally, a real-world case study involving 237 products across six categories from a European grocery retailer confirms the practical applicability of our approach. It demonstrates significant potential for improving space utilization and layout efficiency.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Power of Star Creators: Evidence from the Live Streaming Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, the authors examine the impact of star creator exits on digital content markets, leveraging exogenous events on Twitch.tv. Using a Synthetic DiD approach, they estimate the causal effects of star creators’ exits from the live streaming platform. Their findings reveal that, at the live streaming category level, the exit of a star creator leads to a sizable decrease in both content provision and consumption within the star creator’s focal category. At the individual creator level, the effects are heterogeneous, varying by the creator’s audience size and contractual status with the platform. Major creators reduce their content provision, while micro creators maintain their streaming activity, though both groups experience a decline in viewership. Additionally, contracted creators tend to sustain their content provision levels following a star creator’s exit, whereas non-contracted creators exhibit a significant decline. Lastly, the authors find that the impact of a star creator’s departure persists for several months, indicating a lasting effect at both the category and individual levels.</content>

    <title>Reputational judgments of foreign MNEs’ societal impact in frontier markets: the role of compatible, crossed, and conflicting signals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do host country stakeholders evaluate foreign MNEs’ local impact? Although MNEs’ desire for a reputation for positive societal impact is well-established in the literature, much less is known about how to actually obtain one—especially in less developed frontier markets. In this inductive, qualitative study across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we examine why host country stakeholders deem some foreign MNEs to have a better reputation for societal impact than others and how firms’ actions and attributes influence these stakeholder perceptions. Leveraging signaling theory, we identify three distinct types of signals (compatible, crossed, and conflicting) and three critical factors (benefit diffusion, empowerment, and hybrid solutions) that shape MNEs’ reputation for societal impact. We also shed light on the role of contextual factors at the country, industry, and community levels. In addition to these theoretical contributions, our study also yields practical implications for MNEs of including local stakeholders’ perspectives when crafting market and nonmarket strategies, fostering constructive communication between headquarters and subsidiaries as well as between expatriate and local actors, and finding ways of going beyond ‘fitting in’ to instead ‘stand out’ in order to gain a reputation for providing tangible and intangible forms of societal impact in frontier markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wholesale market makers pay for retail options orders that must be executed on exchanges. Payment for order flow (PFOF) wholesalers compete via price improvement in exchange auctions. To attract retail orders, wholesalers run more auctions when their recent price improvement has been lower. However, auction price improvement lowers market maker revenues. Wholesalers earn revenues to pay PFOF in nonauction trades where their designated market maker status increases their execution priority. While some auctions produce substantial price improvement, most do not have multiple bidders offering meaningful price improvement. Overall, options market structure better promotes competition in auctions than in nonauctions.</content>

    <title>Keep on Keepin’ on Down Under: Administrative Heritage and the Strategic Realignment of Multinational Enterprises in Australia During Deglobalization, 1914–79</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyse the behaviour of multinational enterprises (MNEs) within a host nation – Australia – during deglobalization (1914–79). Deglobalization is often portrayed as a drastic event to which MNEs respond swiftly, probably through withdrawal from host countries. However, we generate new FDI and firm population data to reveal incumbent MNEs remained. We then deploy historical primary evidence from three companies to analyse their responses. Firms adapted by deepening their local engagement, drawing on local information sources and entrepreneurship, and by shifting some strategic control to the subsidiary. These adaptations extended across decades, as each MNE wrestled with knowledge gaps and organizational rigidities that reflected its particular administrative heritage. Our historical methodology also reveals how firms were affected differently, responded at different speeds, and varied in their subsequent embeddedness. We conclude that deglobalization's impact on firms may be a subtle, reiterative, and prolonged process, rather than a sudden and dramatic event.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can displays of charity capacity cues paradoxically harm charities' fundraising efforts? Six pre‐registered studies provide evidence of acharity capacity cursewhereby donors penalize charities for displaying capacity cues, such as human resources capacity, organizational capacity, and financial capacity cues. This curse occurs because donors perceive higher‐capacity charities as needing less help. As donors typically donate based on need, they donate less to charities with superior capacity signals. This effect is attenuated when: (1) higher‐capacity charities' needs are made salient, and (2) donors reflect on how their decision impacts end‐beneficiaries. This research contributes to the literature on effective altruism and charity perceptions while offering managerial insights for charities seeking to optimize their fundraising communications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a new source for the declining role of small banks in the banking industry: Long-term changes in the banking sector are partially a consequence of changes in the industrial sector. Small banks are relatively more exposed to small business shocks, because small businesses compose a larger share of their customers. Lower real-side demand for small business financial services is responsible for part of the relative decline in small banks’ deposits. Rough calculations suggest that deposits at small banks would have been $280 billion higher from 2002 to 2017 if small firms had grown at the rate of larger firms. (JEL G21, G34, L25, R12)</content>

    <title>How Does Removing the Tax Benefits of Debt Affect Firms? Evidence from the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of tax benefits of debt on firms remains an open question. The 2017 U.S. tax reform limited the tax advantage of debt for all firms except for small businesses with average sales below $25 million. A regression discontinuity design based on the exception threshold shows that, as tax benefits of debt shrink, corporate debt declines significantly, while equity does not increase sufficiently to offset the reduction. Treated firms also decrease their investments due to the higher cost of capital. Overall, we document a first-order role for tax incentives that affect the cost of capital in shaping corporate policies. (JEL G31, G32, G38, H25, K34)</content>

Low-cost emails highlighting a motivational deadline or semi-personalized salary information increased participation by about 1 percentage point (control mean is 1.25 percent) and contribution rates by about 0.05 percentage points (control mean is 3.92 percent) among previous non-participants. These programs demonstrate a cost-effective and scalable tool by which managers can increase employees’ retirement savings.</content>

    <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fairness concerns arise naturally across a wide range of decision-making contexts and application domains. Addressing these concerns requires integrating fairness measures into optimization models; however, quantifying fairness, as well as formulating and solving fairness-promoting optimization problems, remain significant challenges. In “A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures,” M. Y. Tsang and K. S. Shehadeh propose a new framework that unifies different fairness measures into a general, parameterized class of convex fairness measures. They introduce a unified framework for optimization problems with a convex fairness measure objective or constraint, including unified reformulations and solution methods. Additionally, they establish mechanisms for quantifying the impact of employing different convex fairness measures on the optimal solutions to the resulting fairness-promoting optimization problem. Numerical experiments, including applications to resource allocation and facility location, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the unified framework over traditional ones.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a scenario in which an employee exerts productive effort to achieve a target but can also manipulate a performance measure to falsely claim target achievement. Although manipulation is detrimental from a societal perspective because of its negative externalities, the firm’s shareholders may benefit from undetected manipulation. We analyze the firm’s optimal implementation of internal control and its impact on the employee’s productive effort and manipulative behavior. We demonstrate that a profit-maximizing firm primarily utilizes internal control to enhance the employee’s performance pay contract; however, this does not necessarily reduce manipulation. We identify situations in which internal control reduces or aggravates manipulation and discuss factors that can complement internal control to combat manipulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), Project ID 403041268–TRR 266, Accounting for Transparency and under Germany’s Excellence Strategy, EXC 2126/1–390838866.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04232 .</content>

    <title>Painful Prices: The Moral Harm Model of Price Fairness</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ responses to seller’s prices, including perceptions of price fairness and unfairness, are a crucial aspect of the marketplace. While past literature has uncovered a variety of factors that influence perceptions of price fairness (PPF), the lack of an overarching conceptual framework has constrained understanding of when and why consumers are more likely to perceive prices as fair or unfair. The authors develop a conceptual model of PPF as moral judgments and propose that these moral PPF arise from consumer inferences of potential harm from a price. The conceptualization suggests that inferred harm—and thereby, PPF—are influenced by consumer vulnerability, product welfare impact and firm price strategy (e.g., costs and prices, differential pricing and price promotions). The authors also propose that consumer political orientation and inferred firm self-defense motives moderate the relationship between inferred harm and PPF and that inferred firm motives for prices influence PPF. Eight studies test this conceptualization. The results support the moral harm model and provide novel insights, showing when unchanged prices, price increases and price decreases are likely to be perceived as more unfair, and when differential prices (including paying more than others) are likely to be perceived as fairer than equal prices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a firm’s incentive to share its proprietary technology to help a rival develop a new product. Whereas the rival’s product introduction increases competitive pressure on the firm, it also turns the rival into a multiproduct firm, raising cannibalization concerns that affect its pricing strategy. We find that the rival’s internal cannibalization may soften competition in the existing product market, creating a positive externality for the focal firm and, thus, motivating voluntary technology sharing. We characterize the conditions under which the firm benefits from sharing: generally, the firm is incentivized to share if the new product’s valuation is neither too high nor too low. A high valuation of the new product deters sharing because of excessive competition, whereas a low valuation fails to trigger cannibalization, eliminating the firm’s incentive to share. Our analysis further shows that new product introduction generally enhances social welfare except when the existing product has high valuation and the new product has relatively low valuation. Consumer surplus increases only when the existing product’s valuation is low. These findings offer guidance for policymakers, suggesting when favorable policies should be implemented to promote technology sharing in cases in which social welfare or consumer surplus is not maximized.</content>
