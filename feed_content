    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for AI integration in research, particularly for data annotation and text classification. However, researchers lack guidance on implementation best practices, as the benefits and risks of these tools remain poorly understood. We develop a foundational framework for effective LLM implementation in management research, providing structured guidance on key decisions throughout the research process. We illustrate this framework through an empirical application: classifying sustainability claims in crowdfunding projects. While LLMs can match or exceed traditional methods' performance at lower cost, we find that variations in prompt design can significantly affect results and downstream analyses. We develop procedures for sensitivity analysis and provide detailed documentation to help researchers implement robustness while maintaining methodological integrity.Managerial SummaryLarge language models (LLMs) offer powerful new tools for business research, especially for analyzing and categorizing text data. However, managers and researchers lack clear guidance on how to use these tools effectively and reliably. This study creates a practical framework for implementing LLMs in management research, covering key decisions from model selection to result validation. Using a real‐world example of analyzing sustainability claims in crowdfunding campaigns, we demonstrate that LLMs can match traditional methods while being faster and cheaper. However, small changes in how you instruct the AI can significantly alter results and business conclusions. We provide systematic procedures for testing result reliability and offer practical tools to help managers implement AI‐powered analysis while maintaining rigorous standards and avoiding misleading findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer choices are constrained in many markets due to either supply-side rationing or information frictions. Examples include matching markets for schools and colleges; entry-level labor markets; limited brand awareness and inattention in consumer markets; and selective admissions to healthcare services. We analyze a general random utility model for consumer preferences that allows for endogenous characteristics and a reduced-form choice-set formation rule that can be derived from models of the examples described above. We show non-parametric identification of this model, propose an estimator, and apply these methods to study admissions in the market for kidney dialysis in California. Our identification results require two sets of instruments, one that only affects consumer preferences and the other that only affects choice sets. We show that both instruments are necessary for identification. These results also suggest tests of choice-set constraints, which we apply to the dialysis market. We find that dialysis facilities are less likely to admit new patients when they have a higher-than-normal caseload and that patients are more likely to travel further when nearby facilities have high caseloads. Finally, we estimate consumers’ preferences and facilities’ rationing rules using a Gibbs sampler.</content>

    <title>Unveiling the Human Touch: Enhancing Customer Satisfaction Through Personal Profiles of Social Media Customer Service Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are rapidly adopting social media platforms to optimize their customer service operations. Given the central role of social media as a primary point of contact with customers and the critical importance of maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction, it is imperative to craft positive experiences during service interactions. To enhance customer interaction with a personal touch, U.S. telecom giant T-Mobile replaced standardized profiles with personal profiles for its social media customer service agents on Twitter. Leveraging this exogenous change, we investigate how these personal profiles affect customer behaviors within service operations. We adopt a difference-in-differences empirical strategy in this research. The results show that implementing personal profiles for customer service agents increases positive sentiment in customer tweets, reduces the likelihood of complaints, and improves overall satisfaction. Further analyses suggest that the effects vary across customer groups, with greater impact among verified Twitter users and female customers. While personalized agent profiles can enhance satisfaction, they also heighten expectations for timely responses, making delays more detrimental than with standardized profiles. To explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an online randomized experiment. In addition to reinforcing the causal inference from our secondary data analysis, causal mediation analysis of the experimental data shows that personal agent profiles influence satisfaction and the likelihood of customers expressing gratitude through the perceived warmth and perceived competence of the agents. Interestingly, while the effect on gratitude is mediated by humanization, we do not find a similar mediation effect on satisfaction. This suggests distinct pathways through which humanization shapes different aspects of the customer experience.</content>

    <title>When a Star Shines Too Bright: The Impact of a High-Status Minority Member on Pursuing Diversity Goals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The current research examines a potential implication of having a high-status minority member in organizations—a “star” athlete, professor, or lawyer. Building on the literature on organizational diversity, individual status, and licensing effects, we suggest that having a minority member with high status can license organizational decision makers to reduce their effort in increasing diversity compared with having a minority member with relatively low status. We analyzed the hiring outcomes of Major League Baseball teams from 1988 to 2019 and found that the teams with a higher-status minority player hired fewer minority players in the next draft compared with the teams with a lower-status minority player. This effect was moderated by role prototypicality and group membership—the attributes that would further increase the saliency of a high-status minority player. We then corroborated these findings in a laboratory experiment showing that participants were less willing to invest effort in hiring minority candidates when a company already had a high-status (versus low-status) minority member. These findings extend existing literature by demonstrating when and how the presence of a prominent minority member might inadvertently diminish organizational efforts to increase diversity.Funding: The studies were funded by New York University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15155 .</content>

    <title>Race, Sexual Orientation, and Intersectionality in Distributive Negotiation Outcomes for Men</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Negotiations have consequences for people’s career trajectories, wealth, and well-being. Yet we still have a limited understanding of how demographic characteristics such as sexual orientation and race influence distributive negotiation outcomes, much less the intersection of multiple marginalized identities. To contribute to (1) our understanding of how identity influences negotiations and (2) research on intersectionality, we test how race (Black versus East Asian versus White) and sexual orientation (gay versus straight) influence distributive negotiation outcomes for men in a field experiment. We conducted a large-scale (n = 3,000), preregistered audit experiment involving (fictitious) buyers negotiating for cars on Craigslist. Sellers were 7.7 percentage points (22.4%) less likely to respond to gay versus straight White men. Sellers were also less polite in responses to Black and East Asian men (of any sexual orientation) than to straight White men. In a preregistered follow-up experiment (n = 500), we show that impoliteness in negotiation responses reduces positive expectations about negotiations and behavioral intentions to negotiate in the future, suggesting that differences in politeness may have consequences for racial minorities’ willingness to initiate future negotiations. Our work illuminates how identity-based biases manifest in negotiations, offers insights into theories of intersectionality, and underscores how demand-side biases can lead to supply-side differences in negotiation propensity.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18464 .</content>

    <title>A Low-Rank Augmented Lagrangian Method for Doubly Nonnegative Relaxations of Mixed-Binary Quadratic Programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low-Rank Approaches to Large-Scale DNN OptimizationDoubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxations are a powerful tool for approximating large-scale mixed-binary quadratic programs, but their size—often involving millions of constraints—makes them difficult to solve. We propose RiNNAL, a Riemannian augmented Lagrangian method that exploits the low-rank structure often present in optimal solutions. By applying a low-rank decomposition, RiNNAL reformulates most quadratic constraints into simpler affine ones, reducing problem complexity and mitigating issues caused by violations of Slater’s condition. A key innovation is showing that the required metric projection onto a certain algebraic variety, although nonconvex in form, can be solved as a convex optimization problem under mild regularity conditions, enforced through constraint reformulation. RiNNAL is versatile, handling not only DNN relaxations but also general semidefinite programs with polyhedral constraints. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks confirm its efficiency and robustness, making RiNNAL a promising solver for large-scale optimization problems.</content>

    <title>Local Cost Synergies in Reverse Auctions: An Application to Road Salt Procurement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Each winter, Minnesota’s Department of Transportation purchases nearly a quarter-million tons of road salt through competitive auctions. In Local Cost Synergies in Reverse Auctions: An Application to Road Salt Procurement (Gupta, Schmitt, and Stamatopoulos), the authors show that large firms benefit from “local cost synergies” when they win clusters of nearby depots. Because these synergies reduce costs, large firms are able to bid about 9% lower, on average, than they would otherwise. This cost advantage sharply reduces the probability that small firms will win contracts and leads simultaneous auctions to allocate depots less efficiently than possible. The authors conclude that any rigorous examination of procurement auctions must explicitly account for local cost synergies; ignoring them risks producing misleading results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of information processing and learning about expected future cashflows on the level and timing of risk premiums in the cross section of firms. Learning with information sources of different qualities endogenously generates value firms, growth firms, and a value premium in equilibrium. Furthermore, the learning model predicts an upward-sloping equity term structure for value firms and a flat equity term structure for growth firms. Using earnings, return, and news data on value and growth firms, we show that the predictions of the learning model are consistent with the data.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: Research support from Long-Term Investors@UniTo, the University of Neuchatel, and the University of Toronto is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05922 .</content>

    <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Strategies with Predictive and Prognostic Covariates in Adaptive Clinical Trials</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Biomedical research may uncover insights regarding the interaction of the treatments of a disease with patient covariates. We show how to use such insights to improve the efficiency of adaptive clinical trials for precision medicine by extending ideas from optimal Bayesian learning. We present a model for response-adaptive multi-arm clinical trials that leverages knowledge about the predictive-prognostic covariate structure to accelerate the learning of personalized treatment strategies that obtain the best expected outcomes for post-trial patients. Our base model is a contextual linear bandit for best-arm identification, and outcomes may be observed with delay. We characterize the optimal policy for sequentially allocating treatments to in-trial patients and, because it is hard to compute, propose several computable heuristics based on Bayesian one-step look-ahead techniques. We prove that several of our proposed heuristics are asymptotically optimal in learning treatment strategies. Numerical results based on two case studies motivated by sepsis management show that our heuristics can significantly improve clinical trial efficiency to learn a treatment strategy for precision medicine. We provide extensions that allow for rewards from outcomes of in-trial patients (resolving the exploration-exploitation tradeoff) and for inferring covariate structure using Lasso when biomedical insights on covariate structure are lacking. Our proposed trial design is of interest to funders, designers, and managers of clinical trials. It may also apply to other contextual bandit problems in settings where insights about covariate-treatment interactions are available.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [Grant 676129].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we develop novel measures of managerial labor market classification and competition by constructing networks of compensation benchmarking peers disclosed in proxy statements. These networks represent firms’ relative positions within the managerial labor market. Our classifications strongly predict executive moves across firms, outperforming a comprehensive set of predictors in the literature. Subsequent tests further demonstrate the strength of our methodology in capturing the multidimensional and dynamic features of the managerial labor market. We also validate our competition measures by showing that they are associated with retention tools, such as higher equity pay and longer pay duration. Finally, we apply our measures to test two theoretical predictions. First, we find that labor market competition could explain controversial pay practices. Second, we demonstrate that the labor market provides managers with tournament incentives to deliver superior future performance.</content>

    <title>Founders' pre‐entry knowledge and the heterogeneous returns to accelerator participation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While startup accelerators often benefit founders and their ventures, these gains may not be uniform. We examine how founders' pre‐entry knowledge—the cumulative education, industry experience, and entrepreneurial exposure that teams acquire prior to launching their startups—shapes the heterogeneous returns to accelerator participation. We propose two potential mechanisms driving these returns:knowledge compensation, whereby accelerators fill gaps in basic knowledge and competencies, andknowledge complementarity, whereby accelerators amplify the absorption and deployment of expert knowledge. Using data from 6723 startups and their founding teams, we find evidence in support of the complementarity mechanism. Our findings also suggest that the returns to accelerator participation are contingent on the alignment between founders' pre‐entry knowledge and program design.Managerial SummaryWhile startup accelerators aim to level the entrepreneurial playing field, we find that founders with substantial pre‐entry knowledge and experience tend to gain more from participation in these programs than novice entrepreneurs, potentially widening startup performance gaps. Program design also appears to play a key role. While specialized and unstructured programs offer value for seasoned entrepreneurs by building complementary knowledge, structured and generalist programs offer some, albeit limited, opportunities for less‐experienced teams to build foundational skills. These findings underscore the need for tailored programming that aligns with participants' learning needs. For program designers and policymakers, these findings suggest investing in diverse formats to support varied founder profiles. For entrepreneurs, they highlight the importance of selecting programs that complement and build upon their team's prior knowledge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the U.S. housing credit boom, publicly traded banks increased mortgage lending activity and relaxed standards much more than privately held banks. The increase in risk had real effects for a variety of county-level aggregates including employment and consumption. Cross-sectional evidence and a quasi-experiment indicate that the increase in risk stemmed from the institutional ownership and the equity compensation of publicly traded banks, in turn leading banks to place greater weight on short-term equity performance. These results are consistent with the view that a focus on short-term earnings and stock prices amplifies boom–bust credit cycles, in turn leading to real cycles for the aggregate economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use novel surveys of firms and workers, linked to administrative employer-employee data, to study the prevalence and importance of individual bargaining in wage determination. We show that simple survey questions accurately elicit firms’ bargaining strategies. Using the elicited strategies for 772 German firms, we document that the majority of firms are willing to engage in individual wage bargaining. Labor market factors predict firms’ strategies better than firm characteristics. Survey responses from nearly 10,000 full-time workers indicate that most workers provide their salary expectations before they receive a job offer. Most outside offers are rejected, with the worker remaining at the incumbent firm. There is substantial heterogeneity in workers’ bargaining behavior, which translates into within-firm wage inequality. Firms that set pay via individual bargaining have a 3 percentage point higher gender wage gap.</content>

    <title>Diversifying Society’s Leaders? The Determinants and Causal Effects of Admission to Highly Selective Private Colleges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use anonymized admissions data from several colleges linked to income tax records and SAT and ACT test scores to study the determinants and causal effects of attending Ivy-Plus colleges (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and Chicago). Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at Ivy-Plus colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, and (3) athletic recruitment. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average flagship public college increases students- chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 50%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and almost triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. The three factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas academic credentials such as SAT/ACT scores are highly predictive of post-college success.</content>

    <title>Disruptive Timing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the role of strategic timing in disruptive innovation. We construct a model where an entrant decides when to enter with a potentially disruptive technology and the incumbent determines whether and when to switch from its existing technology. By accounting for endogenous firm-specific learning alongside exogenous technological improvement, our model highlights the critical role of timing in shaping disruption. First, an entrant’s strategic timing—whether to enter early or delay entry—can cause disruption by deferring the timing of the incumbent’s response or deterring it altogether. Second, we identify conditions where incumbents, even those unable to initially mount a response, can later switch to the disruptive technology and coexist with an entrant. Based on these insights, we propose a typology of five distinct disruption types—Perfect, Postponed, Passing, Phased, and Partial—that expands the traditional understanding of disruption beyond the often-studied “perfect” cases to comprehend transient and mixed cases as well. Our theory of disruptive timing integrates literature on strategic timing and disruptive innovation to offer a new perspective for scholars and actionable insights for practitioners.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01734 .</content>

    <title>How Does Health Insurance Affect Firm Employment and Performance? Evidence from Obamacare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article discusses how mandating employers to provide health insurance of a minimum quality and the associated increases in health insurance premia affect firm employment and performance. Using firm-level employee health insurance data around the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we show that the PPACA is associated with a significant increase in health insurance premia for employees in company-sponsored health insurance plans. In response, employers with greater exposure to the PPACA reduce employee enrollments in their health insurance plans to a larger extent after the law’s enactment. Our analysis suggests that employers achieve this reduction in enrollment by shifting employment composition from full-time employees to part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, who are not covered in employer-sponsored health insurance plans. Furthermore, we find no evidence of deterioration in performance at companies more exposed to the increase in health insurance premia. Overall, our findings illustrate how firms adapt to and mitigate cost increases associated with regulatory changes through strategic labor practices.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03761 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can we compare approaches to increase retirement savings? Messaging interventions, active choice frameworks, and automatic enrollment all increase retirement savings, but evidence supporting these approaches spans widely different institutional settings, populations, and time periods. In this study, we use experimental and quasi-experimental variation in these approaches within a constant setting using interventions in the U.S. military during 2016–2018. We find large differences in the efficacy of these approaches, with active choice and automatic enrollment programs being about 10 and 100 times more effective than messaging interventions, respectively. We also collect novel data on program costs and generate estimates of cost-effectiveness for each program. We find that active choice and automatic enrollment are consistently more cost effective than any messaging interventions, active choice programs are the most cost-effective for small firms, and automatic enrollment is the most cost-effective program for larger firms.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the TIAA Institute, Wharton School’s Pension Research Council and Boettner Center, the Social Security Administration, and the NBER Retirement and Disability Research Center for financial support.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compassion ventures addressing human suffering after disasters are gaining attention in entrepreneurship research, yet little is known about their potential to expand beyond immediate response. This 19-month qualitative study examines a compassion venture amid the Russo-Ukrainian war and shows how self-reliant, joint, and political forms of entrepreneurial resourcefulness help compassion ventures emerge, formalize, and expand with key partners. We uncover how these forms interact, helping compassion ventures transition to enduring organizations over a prolonged crisis. We present a model of resourcefulness dynamics in compassion venture expansion, emphasizing its political dimension, and contribute to research on compassion venturing and entrepreneurial resourcefulness.</content>

    <title>Full of It: Strategic Lying, Epistemic Conflict, and Issue Field Polarization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although scholars across several disciplines have noted the “posttruth” turn in public discourse, institutionalists provide little insight into the use of lying as a form of strategic discourse in contesting institutionalized practices, values, and beliefs. We address this gap by developing theory about the role that lies play in the discursive contestation of issue fields. We posit the concept of strategic lies (i.e., lies intended to manipulate the institutionalized practices, values, and beliefs at the focus of an issue field) and explicate how such lies cause epistemic conflicts (i.e., discursive conflicts between the field’s discrete communities over the truth value of those lies). We suggest that these epistemic conflicts increase a field’s level of polarization and concomitantly destabilize the field’s institutional status quo. We highlight the integral role that media organizations play in epistemic conflicts by explaining how such organizations frame statements as strategic lies and publicize them to the communities comprising an issue field. We assert that strategic lies can catalyze vicious cycles of polarization and epistemic conflict in issue fields. Our study thus provides a novel and rigorous conceptualization of the important role of strategic lying in the institutional processes structuring a field.</content>

    <title>Consider or Choose? The Role and Power of Consideration Sets</title>
    <updated>2025-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consideration sets play a crucial role in discrete choice modeling, where customers often form consideration sets in the first stage and then use a second-stage choice mechanism to select the product with the highest utility. Although many recent studies aim to improve choice models by incorporating more sophisticated second-stage choice mechanisms, this paper takes a step back and goes into the opposite extreme. We simplify the second-stage choice mechanism to its most basic form and focus on modeling customer choice by emphasizing the role and power of the first-stage consideration set formation. To this end, we study a model that is parameterized solely by a distribution over consideration sets with a bounded rationality interpretation. Intriguingly, we show that this model is characterized by the axiom of symmetric demand cannibalization, enabling complete statistical identification. The latter finding highlights the critical role of consideration sets in the identifiability of two-stage choice models. We also examine the model’s implications for assortment planning, proving that the optimal assortment is revenue-ordered within each partition block created by consideration sets. Despite this compelling structure, we establish that the assortment problem under this model is NP-hard even to approximate, highlighting how consideration sets contribute to nontractability, even under the simplest uniform second-stage choice mechanism. Finally, using real-world data, we show that the model achieves prediction performance comparable to other advanced choice models. Given the simplicity of the model’s second-stage phase, this result showcases the enormous power of first-stage consideration set formation in capturing customers’ decision-making processes.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00442 .</content>

    <title>Beyond Discrete‐Time Hazard Regression: Bayesian Regularization for Dynamic Churn Modeling</title>
    <updated>2025-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discrete‐time hazard regression is widely applied to firm‐level time‐to‐event analyses and increasingly to individual churn behaviors. While the discrete logit hazard model for panel data remains the workhorse in OM, both fixed‐effects and random‐effects specifications have key limitations. The Grassia(II)‐Geometric (G2G) model—allowing for dynamic churn and asymmetric heterogeneity—offers a compelling alternative for hazard regression and churn prediction. To address high‐dimensional data, we propose Bayesian sparsity modeling via spike‐and‐slab LASSO (SSL) that enables simultaneous regularization and inference—both crucial for explanatory hypothesis testing. Simulation studies show that even when data are generated from logit functions with additive heterogeneity, asymmetric heterogeneity undermines logit regression, whereas G2G‐SSL achieves stronger out‐of‐sample fit with lower false discovery rates. We further validate its predictive power in an empirical study on voluntary employee turnover at a Fortune 500 manufacturer. The proposed approach outperforms a range of advanced methods, improving both churn time prediction and cost efficiency for prescriptive workforce planning. Finally, we outline methodological extensions and provide a modeling procedure for discrete hazard regression analysis. By importing insights from marketing and Bayesian statistics, our work enables OM scholars to move beyond traditional hazard models and better capture real‐world heterogeneity across a broad range of contractual churn scenarios.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Asset Selling</title>
    <updated>2025-11-18T14:38:54+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online asset-selling businesses, such as used cars and real estate platforms, have experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Unlike general retail operations, which make decisions at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level, asset selling operates at the individual unit asset level. Practical operational constraints (e.g., infrequent price adjustments within a limited timeframe) set asset-selling platforms apart from general retail. Further complicating decision-making are real-world uncertainties, such as volatile demand and unknown latent value of the asset. We present a dynamic pricing framework that captures the salient characteristics of the asset-selling business while leveraging consumer online behavioral data to maximize the payoff of individual assets. We develop practical algorithms for solving the dynamic pricing problem, including a mean approximation (MA) algorithm that uses forecast mean values as proxies for future customer arrival rates and online learning algorithms that integrate learning of the latent value of an asset with dynamic pricing decisions. To evaluate these algorithms, we propose an asymptotic regime suitable for the online asset-selling business context, one that scales up customer demand arrival rate within a finite time horizon. The key findings are that, under mild conditions, the expected value of selling an asset is concave and increasing at a logarithmic rate with respect to demand rates and increasing no faster than a linear speed in the asset’s latent value. These properties allow us to derive the performance bounds of our policies. An extensive numerical study and a real-data calibrated case study demonstrate the practical value of our proposed algorithms, suggesting that those simple heuristics can achieve strong performance in the asset-selling environment. Moreover, our integration of the learning of an asset’s latent value with dynamic pricing decisions, alongside asymptotic analysis, provides a robust framework for data-driven decision-making and demonstrates the potential of consumer behavior data as a strategic asset for online asset-selling platforms.</content>

    <title>How Does Prepopulating Search Bars with Keywords Affect Online Consumer Behavior? A Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-11-18T14:38:54+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Search aid technologies, especially prepopulated search bars, are increasingly being adopted by major players in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of prepopulating search bars with keywords on online consumer journey. In this study, I design and run a randomized field experiment on a large e-commerce platform involving 72,587 consumers who were randomly exposed to three types of keywords prefilled in the search bar. Individual consumer–level analyses reveal that prepopulating trending category keywords encourages users to discover and buy items from the suggested category without reducing queries using self-entered keywords, ultimately leading to a 10.4% (8.8%) increase in purchase incidence (spending) compared with the counterfactual outcomes when the search bar is empty. Prepopulating personalized keywords brings about more focused product searching within the category recently browsed by users, resulting in a 21% (17%) increase in purchase incidence (spending), although this is offset by the negative effect of a reduction in queries using self-entered keywords. Exposure to niche category keywords is found to have little impact. This study also finds that a prepopulated search bar does not cannibalize the other navigation tool, making it a beneficial addition to the focal e-commerce platform’s business outcomes. These findings, contributing to the literature on consumer search and product recommendation strategies for digital platforms, carry timely implications for e-commerce managers.History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0793 .</content>

Using a large language model (LLM) to capture information in both words and word context, I show that the news in earnings press releases (i) explains three times more variation in short-window stock returns than a host of textual measures based on dictionary and non-LLM machine learning methods; (ii) doubles the R2of an array of financial statement surprises, modeled with conventional regression or machine learning approaches; and (iii) accounts for a large fraction of immediate price revisions within just five minutes of release. LLM-modeled conference calls further enhance R2by one fourth compared with press releases and financial surprises. Textual disclosures are more informative when earnings are less persistent and during periods of aggregate uncertainty. Most news arises from text describing numbers, at the beginning of the disclosure, and including novel contents. These findings highlight the role of firms’ textual disclosures in moving stock prices and advance our understanding of how investors utilize corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Naveen Jindal School of Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05417 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theoretical framework for network-motivated forbearance lending, or forbearance lending to influential buyers and sellers in a supply network. Because dominant banks in a financial market internalize the negative externality of an influential firm’s exit, they may continue to refinance a loss-making influential firm at an interest rate lower than the prime rate. This type of forbearance lending is distinct from other strategies such as evergreening or gambling for resurrection, and we show that network-motivated forbearance lending is independent of the financial soundness of the bank and can be welfare improving. To evaluate the extent of the externality of an influential seller or buyer, we propose two measures: the price influence coefficient and the demand influence coefficient, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Seimeikai Foundation; the Seoul National University Institute of Economic Research, Housing and Commercial Bank Economic Research Fund; the Nomura Foundation; and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grants 15K01217, 16K13367, 17K03818, 20K20511, 23243050, 26245037, 26590051].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00459 .</content>

    <title>Price-Fixing Cartels and Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between price-fixing cartels and firm innovation using a data set encompassing all 461 cartel cases and 1,818 firms identified in the United States in the years 1975–2016. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals a positive relationship between collusion and innovation. Colluding firms exhibited increases of 28% in patent filings, 20% in top-quality patents, and 16% in research and development investment. Innovation breadth also expanded by 16%, suggesting that firms explored new technological areas. Once cartels were dissolved, innovation activities reverted to precollusion levels. The effect varied across industries and was more pronounced in fast-growing and patent-intensive industries, underscoring the importance of technological opportunities. Further, the umbrella pricing effect that also benefits noncolluding competitors offers a unique opportunity to unpack mechanisms. Results reveal that the extra financial resources account for at least a quarter of the effect with stronger cartels exhibiting more pronounced effects. Specifically, firms that relied more on internal financing before collusion and that generated higher revenues during collusion showed a greater effect; no evidence was found of capital reallocation within firms. As much as the remaining three quarters of the effect can be attributed to managerial expectations of future profitability. These findings offer insights for managers and policymakers aiming to foster novel innovation although careful interpretation is required given the heterogeneous effects.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01838 .</content>

    <title>Blocking Block Formation: Evidence from Private Loan Contracts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the structure of the borrower’s equity ownership matter in debt contracting? This paper addresses this question by examining change in control clauses. These clauses are pervasive in loan contracts, yet their terms are not boilerplate. Examining 14,940 contracts, we document significant heterogeneity in the use and size of ownership caps, which limit large equity block formation. Overall, our evidence indicates that the way equity capital is distributed matters to lenders. Lenders set lower caps to mitigate risks arising from power contests among shareholders, formation of a new (coordinating) block, potentially resulting in activism, and hostile takeover threats via toehold strategies. We confirm some of these effects using two quasi-natural experiments. Caps below 50% are associated with a drop in firm value but not in the cost of debt, consistent with exacerbated firm-manager agency costs. Finally, two findings shed light on ways creditors may influence corporate governance: the largest block size increases when these minority block restrictions expire, and the likelihood of withdrawing an announced buyback increases during the life of these loans.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04224 .</content>

    <title>Project Networks and Reallocation Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A project involves several participants—including clients, contractors, and subcontractors—that work concurrently on multiple projects and allocate resources among them. This interdependency creates a network of otherwise-unrelated projects. We map the network of U.S. government projects involving over 150,000 participants. We show that a seemingly localized disruption, affecting only one project site, eventually causes delays across unrelated projects. This is because participants opportunistically reallocate resources into disrupted projects, at the expense of other projects, triggering a domino effect of further reallocations in the network. Thus, the costs of on-site disruptions end up being shared by multiple participants in the network, rather than being fully absorbed by the affected project. Performance-based incentives, which reward contractors for timeliness, exacerbate these externalities by encouraging self-interested resource reallocation.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2017-04523].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01574 .</content>

    <title>A Sample Size Calculation for Training and Certifying Targeting Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for determining the sample size required when using an experiment to train and certify a targeting policy. Calculating the rate at which the performance of a targeting model improves with additional training data is a complex problem. We address this challenge by assuming that customers are grouped into segments that capture relevant information about their responsiveness to the firm’s marketing actions. We consider two problem formulations. The first formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that its expected performance exceeds a predefined threshold. The second formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that it outperforms a baseline in an out-of-sample statistical test. We establish theoretical properties of these problems, based on which we propose computationally efficient algorithms for optimal sample size calculations. We illustrate our algorithms and analysis using data from a luxury fashion retailer.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02947 .</content>

    <title>Consequences of Performance-Enhancing Misconduct: Insights from Professional Road Cycling, 2000–2010</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the career consequences experienced by professional cyclists implicated in performance-enhancing drug use as well the spillover effects experienced by their teammates and managers using a data set that observes members of all teams from 2000 to 2011. Our data captures publicly known doping implications that range from informal suspicions published in the media to formal convictions by antidoping and law enforcement authorities. Our unique setting, characterized by expectations of widespread doping despite a rigorous antidoping regulatory regime and close media scrutiny, provides a new perspective on the multilayered ways that actors in competitive industries assess the competing demands of extreme performance pressures versus playing by the rules. We find that only the most severe rules violations are associated with career interruptions for riders, whereas lesser offenses are not. More ambiguous cases of doping, those based on informal suspicion or moderately punished formal convictions, are associated with career interruptions primarily for the sport’s high-performing stars. In contrast to most prior work on spillover effects from peer misconduct, we find that most riders are at a lower risk of career interruptions following teammates’ doping convictions—an effect we attribute to a vetting process in which regulators proactively target peers for increased monitoring, which resolves uncertainties about peers’ doping. Regarding spillover effects on managers’ careers, we find that only extreme levels of formal convictions that signal major team scandals are associated with increased risk of managerial career interruptions. Together, our results suggest an industry-level incentive structure that supports widespread misconduct in a competitive industry despite rigorous monitoring and enforcement.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03681 .</content>

    <title>Too Long, Didn’t Read? The Impact of Length Limits on Microblogging Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms aggressively compete for the participants who create content on their sites. In this study, we delve into one tactic of this competition that has become increasingly popular but received limited scholarly attention—the extension of length limits (i.e., the maximum number of characters in a post)—and how it affects both the production and consumption of social media posts. We investigate these questions by exploiting a natural experiment, the phased rollout of length limit extensions on a leading Chinese microblog platform. Findings suggest that extending length limits significantly increased the number of daily posts of individual users. However, and strikingly, only already active users appear to post more after the extension with little observed change from less active users. Further, results show that extending length limits increases the number of likes each post receives, indicating that extensions improve content quality and may increase engagement in the long term. This suggests that, by permitting longer posts, social media platforms can facilitate engagement from both the post generators and audiences (at least in terms of likes). However, findings also suggest that extending length limits risks further concentrating content generation from the vocal minority, thereby making the silent majority less visible on the platforms.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03629 .</content>

    <title>The (Heterogeneous) Economic Effects of Private Equity Buyouts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effects of private equity buyouts on employment, productivity, and job reallocation vary tremendously with macroeconomic and credit conditions, across private equity groups, and by type of buyout. We reach this conclusion by examining the most extensive database of U.S. buyouts ever compiled, encompassing thousands of buyout targets from 1980 to 2013 and millions of control firms. Employment shrinks 12% over two years after buyouts of publicly listed firms—on average, and relative to control firms—but expands 15% after buyouts of privately held firms. Postbuyout productivity gains at target firms are large on average and much larger yet for deals executed amid tight credit conditions. A postbuyout tightening of credit conditions or slowing of gross domestic product growth curtails employment growth and intrafirm job reallocation at target firms. We also show that buyout effects differ across the private equity groups that sponsor buyouts, and these differences persist over time at the group level. Rapid upscaling in deal flow at the group level brings lower employment growth at target firms. We relate these findings to theories of private equity that highlight agency problems at portfolio firms and within the private equity industry itself.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Harvard Business School’s Division of Research, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation [Grant no. 2014-0136], and the Private Capital Research Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03890 .</content>

    <title>Startup Accelerators, Information Asymmetry, and Corporate Venture Capital Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beyond financial incentives, investments by Corporate Venture Capitalists (CVCs) are often motivated by strategic objectives, such as gaining early exposure to emerging technologies. However, in the presence of information asymmetry, CVCs tend to invest in startups with a high degree of business relatedness—startups that are less risky but lacking in knowledge novelty—which are not ideal for achieving their strategic objectives. With startup accelerators showing promise in mitigating the information asymmetry problem, we examine how a CVC’s investment pattern in a region shifts following a startup accelerator’s entry, with a particular interest in the degree of business relatedness between the CVC’s parent corporation and its portfolio companies. Analyses reveal that CVCs increase investments in startups that are dissimilar to their parent’s business following the entry of startup accelerators. We show that the two pathways through which accelerators reduce information asymmetry—quality signals, and mentorship and training—likely contribute to this change. In addition, the change is most pronounced for CVCs whose parent firm operates in an IT-using—rather than an IT-producing—industry, suggesting that accelerators help IT-using firms gain a foothold in the technology space through CVC investments. These findings deepen the understanding of the role that startup accelerators play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem against the backdrop of digital transformation occurring in nearly every industry.This paper was accepted by Kartik Hosanagar, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03494 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leading retailers have opened up their online storefronts to competitors by operating marketplaces for third-party sellers. We develop a model of entry and price competition at the product market level to analyze the competitive interactions arising within these retailer-led marketplaces. We show that the retailer benefits from the marketplace by mitigating his own capacity constraints and manages competition from third-party sellers through his control of the storefront: by setting the marketplace fee, by steering consumers, and by allocating his own capacity in response to the product supply choices of third-party sellers. We draw managerial implications and examine policy interventions. We find that regulation of marketplace fees has the strongest potential to increase welfare outcomes. Our model provides novel insights into the mechanisms at play in retailer-led marketplaces and explains their prominent role in online retail.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council [Grant FAPoD 101044072]; Fundación Carmen y Severo Ochoa [Grant CEX2019-000915-S]; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [Grant RYC-2016-20307]; BBVA Foundation grant within program “Ayudas Fundacion BBVA a Equipos de Investigacion Cientifica 2019.”</content>

    <title>Does Employer-Paid, Job-Protected Maternity Leave Help or Hurt Female IT Workers? Evidence from Millions of Job Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid maternity leave is considered an important pathway to increasing women’s participation in information technology (IT), as it helps address work-family balance concerns, which are pronounced in the field due to long hours, travel, and the need to keep up with technology. Many governments require that employers pay for maternity leave. Using microlevel data on millions of applications from an online job portal, our study examines whether a policy change in India that expanded employer-paid, job-protected maternity leave for companies with 10 or more employees from short-term (12 weeks) to medium-term (26 weeks) changes companies’ likelihood of considering female applicants for IT jobs. Specifically, postlegislation, we expect that less profitable companies may penalize women in the hiring process because employers must bear the costs associated with providing maternity benefits; we find that women were ∼22% less likely to be invited for an interview, postlegislation, at companies with low profitability. Moreover, at such companies, we do not observe a postlegislation change in applications by women. These results identify an important source of leakage in the pipeline for female IT workers. Additionally, our study suggests that legislation which mandates that maternity leave be paid for by employers (50% of economies that guarantee maternity leave of 14 weeks or longer require that employers fully or partially pay for maternity leave) should be accompanied by the introduction and enforcement of associated laws and guardrails—for example, parental leave and antidiscriminatory laws—to ensure that the spirit of the maternity leave legislation is upheld.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the National Science Foundation [Award 2151311] and Bright Data [in-kind contributions] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.00380 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulators have increasingly mandated firms to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents upon discovering these incidents. We find suggestive evidence indicating that some firms manipulate the discovery date (“misreport”) of a cybersecurity incident to postpone the disclosure of the incident, as evidenced by a pronounced spike in insider sales before the reported discovery date. We also find that misreporting is more prevalent among firms with weak internal control systems, when firms face low litigation risk, and when firms have greater pressure to meet a disclosure deadline. Further, firms suspected of misreporting tend to disclose their remedial actions and assert the restoration of business, mitigating negative market reactions upon disclosure of incidents. Collectively, our results suggest that firms might strategically misreport information about a cybersecurity incident to delay disclosure to gain additional time for remedial actions, which helps them prevent exposing vulnerabilities to malicious actors and alleviate stakeholder anxiety.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01058 .</content>

    <title>Organizational Culture, Innovation, and Competitive Performance: A Multilevel Dynamic Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic evolutionary model of innovation culture and its organizational effects at three levels. At the frontline level, informal bottom-up innovation ideas are driven by unplanned interactions governed by cultural norms, as frontline employees sort themselves into idea generator or implementor behaviors. Management cannot directly control innovation interactions and thus culture, but it can imperfectly nudge it by influencing a sharing norm at the second level. At the third level, the culture influences the innovation performance and productivity of the firm and is thus relevant for the organization’s competitiveness. This modeling approach disentangles how top-down strategy interacts with implicit frontline dynamics of cultural evolution, in the context of innovation. Unguided culture does not lead to maximum firm performance. Management guidance may or may not improve performance, and industry competition may select higher-performing cultures, which then spread through the industry under some circumstances. We characterize under which conditions management has a strong influence on culture and performance and under which conditions performance is driven more by forces outside of management’s control.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05087 .</content>

    <title>The Joint Determination of Haircuts and Interest Rates for Collateralized Loans in Shadow Banking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the joint determination of haircuts and interest rates for collateralized loans in shadow banking within a general equilibrium model. Three results emerge. First, higher downside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs below the debt face value) reduces haircuts only under certain conditions, whereas higher upside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs above the debt face value) always increases them. Second, the relative insensitivity of interest rates to shocks, compared with haircuts, occurs when shocks affect only the upside collateral quality and can also arise endogenously, with changes in haircuts amplified and changes in interest rates dampened. Third, when depositors’ saving needs increase, interest rates unexpectedly rise while haircut requirements are relaxed. The same effects occur when banks’ collateral supply shrinks.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00541 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business managers and policymakers must often communicate magnitudes. Yet conveying large relative magnitudes without desensitizing people to further increases can be challenging because of diminishing sensitivity to large numbers. In this research, we propose that percentage expressions not only make large relative magnitudes (e.g., 500%) appear larger than equivalent non-percentage expressions but also make large increases in relative magnitudes (e.g., from 500% to 600%) appear larger. We posit an explanation: percentages typically have values between 0% and 100%, so when percentages and percentage-point differences reach 100% or more, they seem unusually large. This hypothesis is supported by data scraped from New York Times articles and a series of online experiments employing both management-relevant scenarios and incentive-compatible decisions. Existing theories of magnitude perception either cannot predict all the results of these studies (e.g., numerosity and unitosity) or need further specification to do so (e.g., decision-by-sampling and range-frequency theory). We discuss implications for the theory of magnitude and difference perception and the practice of communicating large magnitudes and changes.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02646 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When home prices threaten to decline, large mortgage investors can benefit from fostering new lending that boosts demand. We ask whether this benefit contributed to the growth in acquisitions of risky mortgages by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) in the first half of 2007. We find that it helps explain the variation of this growth across regions, as well as regional house price and credit changes. The growth predicted by this benefit is on top of the acquisition growth caused by the exit of private-label securitizers. We conclude that the GSEs actively targeted their acquisitions to counter home-price declines.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05912 .</content>

    <title>The Informativeness of Balance Sheet Disaggregations: Evidence from Forecasting Operating Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the usefulness of balance sheet disaggregations in the context of forecasting operating asset growth and its implications for revenue growth. We show that models using disaggregated balance sheet information have greater accuracy than models that use only aggregate information, with the most accurate disaggregation scheme separately considering property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, other noncurrent operating assets, and current operating assets. When investigating market participants’ use of disaggregated balance sheet information, we find that differences in growth predictions from a disaggregated model and an aggregate model are associated with year-ahead abnormal returns, suggesting that investors do not fully utilize disaggregated balance sheet information. We corroborate this result by showing that returns are concentrated around the earnings announcement, are more pronounced for stocks with low transient institutional ownership, and are consistent with subsequent improvements in actual financial performance. Finally, we find that these returns are driven by both the asset growth predictions of a disaggregated model and the ability of such a model to incorporate the unique revenue-generating ability of individual asset components. Importantly, we find that our results are incremental to the information embedded in income statement disaggregations, even when forecasting income statement items such as profitability. Overall, our study provides evidence on the informativeness of balance sheet disaggregations and proposes the use of disaggregated models when forecasting growth in operating assets and its implications for future revenues.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org10.1287/mnsc.2023.01413 .</content>

    <title>Shaping Police Officer Mindsets and Behaviors: Experimental Evidence of Procedural Justice Training</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on organizational justice shows that perceptions of justice by internal and external agents are reliable predictors of key organizational outcomes. But how can we promote the enactment of fair behavior by those with decision-making authority within organizations? This is particularly important for organizations that depend on frequent client interactions, in which individual discretion is required to make consequential decisions, and where necessary evils are unavoidable. Few organizations face this challenge as intensely as police forces, in which misconduct and bad decisions by their street-level bureaucrats can have large negative consequences. This paper analyzes whether police officers can be trained to effectively incorporate the principles of procedural justice in their interactions with citizens. In collaboration with the Mexico City police, we implemented a randomized controlled trial with 1,854 officers to measure whether procedural justice training changed their perceptions of policing and actual behavior on the field. We find significant and positive effects of the training across all measures of the procedural justice model. Our research yields insights into critical elements to consider in organizational training programs, including managerial alignment with the objectives of the training and a consideration of employees’ perceptions of the extent to which their work is understood by others.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: This research was funded by the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) [Grant SINLEC17CA2007].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03243 .</content>

    <title>Skilled Labor Uncertainty and Corporate Investment: Evidence from H-1B Visa Lottery Cycles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how periodic uncertainty about skilled labor supply affects corporate investment using the H-1B visa program for skilled workers as an empirical setting. Exploiting cross-regional variation in H-1B labor flows based on historical immigrant enclaves, we find that firms in regions that attract more H-1B workers concentrate their investments in the quarter after uncertainty about visa access is resolved by the H-1B lottery. Consistent with a skilled labor uncertainty channel, we find that the investment spikes are confined to industries where invested capital cannot be easily redeployed, to firms that cannot easily find domestic substitutes for lost H-1B workers, and to firms that cannot easily arrange alternative employment visas for their foreign employees.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: S.-J.

    <title>Joint Placement, Delivery Promise, and Fulfillment in Online Retail</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions of an online retailer. We have a set of products with given numbers of units to be placed at capacitated fulfillment centers. Once we make the placement decisions, we face demands for the products arriving from different demand regions randomly over time. In response to each demand, we pick a delivery promise to offer, which determines the probability that the demand converts into sales as well as choose a fulfillment center to use to serve the demand. Our goal is to decide where to place the units at the beginning of the selling horizon and to find a policy to make delivery promise and fulfillment decisions over the selling horizon so that we maximize the total expected profit. We give an approximation strategy to obtain solutions with performance guarantees for this joint placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment problem. In our approximation strategy, we construct a bounding function that upper bounds the total expected profit from the delivery promise and fulfillment policy when viewed as a function of the placement decisions. To make the placement decisions, we maximize the bounding function subject to the capacity constraints at the fulfillment centers. To make the delivery promise and fulfillment decisions, we construct a policy that obtains a constant fraction of the bounding function. Using our approximation strategy with appropriate bounding functions, we obtain a solution with a constant factor performance guarantee, but if the size of the system, measured by the numbers of units that we need to place and capacities of the fulfillment centers, is large, then we get an asymptotically optimal solution. We compare our approximation strategy with approaches that ignore the interactions between the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions as well as heuristics that are based on Lagrangian relaxation, demonstrating that our approximation strategy compares quite favorably.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The work of the first and third authors was partly supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant CMMI-2226900].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform-run marketplaces may exploit third-party sellers’ data to develop competing products, but the threat of future competition can deter sellers’ entry. We explore how this trade-off affects the platform’s entry on the marketplace and the referral fee it charges to the third-party sellers. We first characterize the platform’s optimal fee under different degrees of commitment on its own entry policy. We show that full commitment maximizes not only the platform’s payoff but also consumer surplus, as the associated fee induces maximal entry by the sellers. Next, we show how and when the platform’s policy on information sharing between its marketplace and product divisions can substitute for its commitment to entry. We characterize the platform’s optimal information policy and examine how it interacts with the platform’s fee structure. We show that an outright ban on information sharing between the platform’s divisions can reduce consumer welfare as it may lead to a higher referral fee that thwarts sellers’ entry. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the platform’s fee structure as a strategic response in the policy debates on marketplace regulation.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cryptocurrencies have prompted a shift away from classic security attacks toward ransomware-based extortion. To better understand the impact of cryptocurrencies on the cybersecurity landscape, we conduct a comparative analysis of cybersecurity metrics prior to and after the adoption of cryptocurrency using a series of connected software-use models in the presence of security externalities. In this framework, we endogenize the actions of both heterogeneous consumers and attackers, with entry of the latter being driven by both the size of the unpatched consumer population and, as a subset of it, the size of the ransom-paying consumer population. We first examine users’ adoption and patching behavior under both security scenarios. We explore how changes in attacker entry costs impact outcomes under both conventional and post-crypto ransomware threat landscapes. We show that ransomware scenarios may be more desirable than conventional ones when attacker entry costs are low, provided that the gains from entering with standard attacks under the ransomware scenario are not too high. However, under such scenarios, social welfare can increase under the same conditions that lead to larger ransoms being demanded and a higher expected total ransom being paid, which presents a conundrum to policymakers. We also examine the impact of market parameters associated with security losses from conventional attacks and residual losses when victims pay in ransomware attacks.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was partially supported by Insung Research Grant of KUBS, the LG Yonam Foundation (of Korea), and an award from the Georgia Institute of Technology Center of International Business Education and Research as part of its funded research program.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00969 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test competing theories of liquidity dynamics during extreme volatility spikes (EVSs). We find that liquidity providers strategically allow for price pressures and are compensated from correcting pricing errors. As a result, liquidity provision intensifies toward the end of a typical EVS. This goes counter to a widespread concern that market-making constraints cause liquidity to deteriorate as EVSs develop. The prevailing limit order book dynamics during EVSs are in line with the socially beneficial equilibrium presented in the theoretical literature.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04104 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can digital payments help reduce extreme hunger? Humanitarian needs are at their highest since 1945, aid budgets are falling behind, and hunger is concentrating in fragile states where repression and aid diversion present major obstacles. In such contexts, partnering directly with governments is often neither feasible nor desirable, making private digital payment platforms a potentially useful means of delivering assistance. We experimentally evaluated digital payments to extremely poor, female-headed households in Afghanistan, as part of a partnership between community, nonprofit, and private organizations. The payments led to substantial improvements in food security and mental well-being. Despite beneficiaries’ limited tech literacy, 99.75% used the payments, and stringent checks revealed no evidence of diversion. Before seeing our results, policymakers and experts are uncertain and skeptical about digital aid, consistent with the lack of prior evidence on digital payments for humanitarian response. Delivery costs are under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Programme’s global figure for cash-based transfers. These savings can help reduce hunger without additional resources, demonstrating how hybrid partnerships utilizing digital payment platforms can help address grand challenges in difficult contexts.This paper was accepted by Caroline Flammer, sustainability.Funding: Research funding was provided by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, awarded through the J-PAL Crime and Violence Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06469 .</content>

    <title>Do Managers Successfully Shop for Auditors Who Allow Them to Opportunistically Report Positive News? Evidence from Accounting Estimates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior auditor shopping literature examines managers’ attempts to opportunistically underreport negative news by finding auditors who will allow them to avoid negative audit opinions or underreport goodwill impairments or financial misstatements. We advance this literature by examining management attempts to opportunistically report positive news, as captured by income-increasing changes in accounting estimates. Adapting a previous framework, we find that, ex ante, managers are more (less) likely to dismiss their auditor if it increases (decreases) the expected likelihood of reporting income-increasing changes in accounting estimates (POSCHGs). We also find that, ex post, following auditor dismissals, the frequency and magnitude of POSCHGs increase, and companies reporting POSCHGs are more likely to restate earnings, receive Securities and Exchange Commission comment letters related to estimates, meet or beat earnings targets, and less likely to receive going concern opinions or violate debt covenants. Placebo tests show that none of the above results hold for income-decreasing changes in estimates. Finally, we identify several institutional factors that constrain managers’ ability to shop for lenient auditors, including the quality of the successor auditor and strong corporate governance. Collectively, our findings are consistent with managers successfully shopping for auditors who allow them to opportunistically report positive news following auditor dismissals.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05299 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of student loan forbearance on job search outcomes. Our experimental setting is the 2020 federal student loan moratorium that provided some borrowers with forbearance by pausing the payments on their student loans. We use data on unemployment insurance claims, payroll records, and credit histories to compare unemployed borrowers who received forbearance to unemployed borrowers who had to continue making payments. We find that the payment pause did not have any economically or statistically significant effects on job search durations or subsequent incomes. Further, we find no heterogeneity in these effects across borrowers’ financial, demographic, or labor market characteristics.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04047 .</content>

    <title>Position Auctions with Endogenous Product Information: Why Live-Streaming Advertising Is Thriving</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live-streaming advertising in e-commerce is soaring. Both Amazon and Alibaba have employed this novel marketing model to engage consumers by sequentially exhibiting different products through live-streaming videos. In this paper, we adopt a mechanism design framework to model live-streaming e-commerce as a position auction with endogenous provision of product information. We prove that finding the mechanism that simultaneously optimizes position allocation and information provision is NP-hard. Thus, we develop several approximation algorithms. Building on the connection to the order selection problem, our analysis establishes that heuristics relying solely on product information provision can achieve up to 66.9% of the optimal revenue in the worst case. In contrast, heuristics exploiting position allocation alone may result in arbitrarily large revenue losses. We attribute the efficacy of product information provision to its enhancement of the value of ad spots in position auctions. Our findings suggest that advertising that focuses on differentiating product information—as in live-streaming e-commerce—is more lucrative than conventional position-based sponsored search. This managerial insight remains valid when accommodating multiproduct purchases with dependency or accounting for random consumer attention spans.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72201234, 72192805], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16211619, 16502219, 16212821, 16501722, C6032-21G], and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mathematical Foundations for Artificial Intelligence [Grant 2023B1212010001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01299 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research in social psychology has shown that when people feel anxious, they seek advice from others. Yet, companies that operate in high-anxiety settings (like financial services, healthcare, and education) are increasingly deploying self-service technologies (SSTs), through which anxious customers transact without access to human contact. These companies may therefore face a classic efficiency–service trade-off where gains in operational efficiency through automation also hamper service outcomes by neglecting customer anxiety. This paper, set in the high-anxiety domain of financial services, investigates the value of facilitating access to human contact during SST usage. In a field experiment conducted within the context of a credit union’s SST loan-approval process, an invitation to connect with a human loan agent increases the customer uptake rate of approved loans by 24%. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments, which explicitly investigate the linkages among anxiety, choice satisfaction, and firm trust during SST encounters show that compared with participants without anxiety, those who are anxious consistently report lower satisfaction with their choices and less trust in the firm, regardless of the source of their anxiety. When anxiety is related to the SST encounter, facilitating access to human contact dampens anxiety’s negative effects on choice satisfaction and, by extension, increases firm trust. We further observe that these benefits of facilitating access to human contact arise even though very few customers choose to access a person. Taken together, this research reveals an opportunity for firms to maintain operational efficiency in high-anxiety self-service settings without compromising customer experiences and service outcomes.This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.Funding: Funding for this research, apart from internal business costs incurred by our field study partner to support the experiment, was primarily provided by Harvard Business School and partially provided by Dartmouth College.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01029 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use panel data on expected and realized changes in household finances to study the process of expectation formation. Households extrapolate from improvements in financial situation, but deteriorations are associated with an increased dispersion of forecasts, and higher probabilities of both negative and positive forecast errors. Individuals who expect earnings declines to revert too quickly save less and are more likely to be financially worse off again in the future. Learning from past errors reduces the likelihood that individuals are optimistic following a deterioration in their finances. The evidence shows how experiences, learning, and life events matter for expectation formation.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03257 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Data-Integrated Newsvendor Solution with Operational Data Analytics (ODA)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the data-integrated newsvendor problem in which the random demand depends on a set of covariates. Observing from the solutions analyzed in the existing studies, we identify the equivariant class of operational statistics (i.e., the mapping from the demand and covariate data to the inventory decision) to develop the operational data analytics (ODA) framework for the contextual newsvendor problem. The equivariant property is intuitively appealing, and it is justified by the fact that, regardless of the sample size, no other decision rule can uniformly dominate the optimal operational statistic within the equivariant class. We also demonstrate that nonequivariant solutions can produce unstable empirical performance with limited samples, whereas equivariant solutions exhibit robustness. When the distribution family of the demand is known but the coefficients of the demand function are unknown, we can directly validate the decision performance of operational statistics within the equivariant class and derive the uniformly optimal solution. When the distribution family of the demand is unknown, we formulate the data integration model as a subclass of equivariant operational statistics, obtained through adaptively boosting some candidate solution. For decision validation, we project the validation data to the demand for the covariates of interests, and the projection is constructed by utilizing the structure of the candidate solution. We demonstrate the superior small-sample performance of adaptive boosting and establish the consistency of the boosted operational statistics. Our ODA formulation, building on the inherent characteristics of the contextual newsvendor problem, highlights the importance of understanding structural properties in data-integrated decision making.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04164 .</content>

    <title>Online Stochastic Optimization with Wasserstein-Based Nonstationarity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a general online stochastic optimization problem with multiple resource constraints over a horizon of finite time periods. In each time period, a reward function and multiple cost functions are revealed, and the decision maker needs to specify an action from a convex and compact action set to collect the reward and consume the resources. Each cost function corresponds to the consumption of one resource. The reward function and the cost functions of each time period are drawn from an unknown distribution, which is nonstationary across time. The objective of the decision maker is to maximize the cumulative reward subject to the resource constraints. This formulation captures a wide range of applications including online linear programming and network revenue management, among others. In this paper, we consider two settings: (i) a data-driven setting where the true distribution is unknown but a prior estimate (possibly inaccurate) is available and (ii) an uninformative setting where the true distribution is completely unknown. We propose a unified Wasserstein distance–based measure to quantify the inaccuracy of the prior estimate in setting (i) and the nonstationarity of the environment in setting (ii). We show that the proposed measure leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for the attainability of a sublinear regret in both settings. For setting (i), we propose an informative gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm takes a primal-dual perspective, and it integrates the prior information of the underlying distributions into an online gradient descent procedure in the dual space. The algorithm also naturally extends to the uninformative setting (ii). Under both settings, we show the corresponding algorithm achieves a regret of optimal order. We illustrate the algorithm’s performance through numerical experiments.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03850 .</content>

    <title>Designing AI-Based Work Processes: How the Timing of AI Advice Affects Diagnostic Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Grants Dean Strategic Fund - Health Informatics (HIIOT)/E and NSCP/ N-171-000-499-001] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72301279].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01454 .</content>

    <title>Institutional Ties and Publications in Top Accounting Journals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Academic journals certify and disseminate scientific knowledge. However, institutional ties between journals and universities can lead to conflicts of interest that compromise peer review. I consider publication patterns in the “Top 3” accounting journals in light of the journals’ governance structures and institutional ties. The Accounting Review (TAR), governed by the American Accounting Association (AAA), has no university affiliations. Journal of Accounting and Economics (JAE) and Journal of Accounting Research (JAR) are private journals with longstanding editorial ties to specific universities: the University of Rochester, the University of Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology for JAE and the University of Chicago for JAR. For publications from 2000–2022, I find that journal-affiliated authors (current faculty and recent PhDs from journal-affiliated universities) publish disproportionately in their affiliate journal. Further analysis suggests that this pattern does not appear to be attributable primarily to authors’ journal submission preferences, particularly for JAR affiliates. In fact, JAR affiliates publish their least cited work in JAR (relative to TAR and JAE), and affiliate articles in JAR receive significantly fewer citations than articles in JAR by authors from top institutions unaffiliated with JAR. Results further suggest that institutional ties may be particularly impactful for pretenure PhD affiliates and for the publication of dissertations. The results are consistent with the idea that institutional ties may influence the publication process in accounting journals, particularly at JAR, where institutional affiliations are formalized and concentrated in one institution.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04553 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a statistical framework of using artificial intelligence to improve human decision making. The performance of each human decision maker is benchmarked against that of machine predictions. We replace the diagnoses made by a subset of the decision makers with the recommendation from the machine learning algorithm. We apply both a heuristic frequentist approach and a Bayesian posterior loss function approach to abnormal birth detection using a nationwide data set of doctor diagnoses from prepregnancy checkups of reproductive-age couples and pregnancy outcomes. We find that our algorithm on a test data set results in a higher overall true positive rate and a lower false positive rate than the diagnoses made by doctors only.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <title>Promotion Decisions and the Adoption of Explicit Potential Assessment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we leverage the transformation of a performance management system that shifts from only providing a performance rating to also providing an explicit assessment of potential. Although performance measures enable organizations to evaluate an employee’s past performance, they provide limited information regarding the employee’s potential to perform in a prospective job that requires a different skill set. Consequently, firms are gradually moving toward the incorporation of explicit potential assessments in their annual appraisal process to evaluate the employee’s promotability to a different task environment. Our data access allows us to provide evidence on the consequences of implementing a performance management system that adopted the explicit assessment of potential. We find that, on average, the performance of promoted employees is lower after implementation, suggesting that the potential assessment system is less effective in identifying candidates suitable for promotion. Additional analyses lead us to conclude that the difficulty of evaluating employee potential reduces performance upon promotion because of inaccurate recommendations of supervisors who do not sufficiently differentiate in their ratings. We thus identify variation in supervisors’ evaluation quality as an important source of the Peter Principle.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02199 .</content>

    <title>Central Bank Liquidity Backstops, Bank Regulation, and Risk-Taking by Asset Managers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Central bank liquidity backstops and bank leverage regulation interact across financial intermediaries and states of the world. A backstop is implemented only in some states to grease the wheels of bank dealers that absorb fire sales. It also incentivizes asset managers to take on excessive redemption risk. Regulation binds in other states, in which it hamstrings market making. Because this outcome increases asset managers’ fire sale costs, it reins in their risk-taking. Empirically, we confirm such a disciplining effect of regulation on U.S. money market funds. Theoretically, we derive that the two policy measures complement each other in raising social welfare because they address different sources of redemption-driven losses—fire sale costs for given risk-taking and excessive risk-taking, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06997 .</content>

    <title>A Blessing or a Curse? Teletriage Service in Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teletriage is a telehealth service that uses telecommunication technologies to remotely assess patients’ conditions and determine their needs for medical treatment. This paper examines how teletriage affects patients’ decisions to seek treatment and when healthcare providers (e.g., medical businesses, hospitals, or clinics) should launch teletriage services. Our findings reveal that teletriage can encourage more mild patients to seek treatment, discouraging more severe patients. This occurs when teletriage lacks sufficient precision and patients’ hassle cost of seeking treatment falls outside a moderate range. Specifically, when hassle costs are low, patients are generally inclined to seek treatment, but teletriage can misclassify severe patients, leading them to avoid necessary care. Conversely, when hassle costs are high, patients tend to stay home, yet teletriage can misidentify mild patients, prompting them to seek unnecessary treatment. As a result, even if teletriage is costless, healthcare providers may abandon this service even though teletriage always increases patient surplus by improving their assessment of their medical needs. Interestingly, patients can be better off seeking treatment from providers who charge higher prices as these providers are more likely to adopt teletriage services. These results caution healthcare policymakers that teletriage can exacerbate healthcare inefficiency instead of alleviating it. Nevertheless, to improve patient surplus, the government should sometimes subsidize providers to offer teletriage or allow providers to charge a higher treatment fee.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71821001, 72325005] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03292 .</content>

    <title>Does Sponsored Search Advertising Augment Organic Search? Evidence from an E-Commerce Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides empirical evidence on the performance of sponsored search advertising in a case study of an unnamed e-commerce platform. I leverage a field experiment that blocks all sponsored search advertising for 3% of site visitors. The experiment shows that sponsored search advertising both steals business from organic listings and also reduces the total volume of transactions intermediated by the platform. However, in this case study, I find that sponsored search is nonetheless profitable for the platform because ad revenue more than compensates for the reduction in commissions that the platform earns on transactions.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04792 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer preferences for product features play an important role in designing successful goods and services. Preferences for features are typically obtained by utilizing a model of choice where the utility for all but one level of an attribute is estimable. That is, the traditional discrete choice model can provide information on the change in utility between attribute-levels, but cannot separately estimate the utility associated with all levels of an attribute. In this paper, we propose a model that integrates conjoint and Maximum Difference scaling data to identify part-worth utilities for all product features, using the outside good as a common reference level, instead of the usual practice of having a reference level for each product attribute. The preference data are also integrated with satisfaction data to identify market opportunities for new and existing products. We illustrate our model with data from a survey measuring customer satisfaction and preferences for large-screen TVs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02560 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Driving Music Demand in the Age of Streaming: Understanding the Heterogeneity in Curated Playlist Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The shift from physical music consumption to online music streaming has fundamentally transformed the market for recorded music, giving consumers access to millions of songs on demand. Because streaming platforms pay artists and labels on a per-play basis, sustained listening and effective discovery have become essential for generating meaningful revenue. With traditional marketing losing relevance for recorded music, curated collections in the form of playlists have emerged as a potentially vital tool for labels to lift streaming demand. As a result, labels have started to deploy playlist marketing by either curating their own playlists or by targeting influential playlists curated by others. However, the success factors behind the impact of playlists on song demand remain insufficiently understood. An analysis of 200,455 quasi-experiments where songs are listed on playlists and later delisted shows an average listing effect of 8.5% more global streams and a carry-over effect of 4% after delisting. Although these effects are highly heterogeneous, they can be systematically explained by playlist design characteristics, including playlist popularity, the song’s prior playlist exposure, the fit between the song and playlist, curator identity, and the curation approach. These findings empower labels to deploy more informed playlist marketing to lift streaming revenue.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Design thinking (DT) has generated significant attention in relation to new product development and innovation and, more generally, value creation activities. Despite its focus on identifying and addressing the needs of users and other stakeholders in an empathetic way, several implementations of DT have resulted in ethically questionable products with negative consequences for firms, customers, and society. This research adopts a grounded theory approach to understand the main ethical concerns with DT as currently practiced and to investigate how DT teams could better include ethical considerations in their work. Based on the analysis of data gathered from in-depth interviews with DT practitioners, it identifies four ethics-related blind spots caused by: (1) the exclusion of the natural environment, (2) narrow definitions of users, (3) quick prototyping and testing, and (4) the rapid increase of scale. Using the development of a Responsible AI product as an illustration, we show that firms can develop three interrelated capabilities to mitigate these blind spots: (1) systemic inclusion of impacted entities and stakeholders, (2) anticipation and mitigation of potential harms, and (3) ethical governance.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effect of nonlinear pricing on markups and misallocation. In a general equilibrium model in which firms are allowed to set a quantity-dependent pricing schedule, markup heterogeneity is not a sign of misallocation. Instead, we point to a new source of misallocation: high-taste consumers are allocated too much of each good, low-taste consumers too little. Using micro data from the retail sector, we show that nonlinear pricing is prevalent and quantify the model. Welfare losses from misallocation across consumers are substantially larger than those from misallocation across firms under linear pricing. (JEL D21, D24, D43, H25, J22, L13, L81)</content>

    <title>International Trade Responses to Labor Market Regulations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper demonstrates that labor market regulations, such as minimum wages or payroll taxes, shape trade competition in labor-intensive activities. I exploit data from a large European trade program where firms from different countries supply labor services at the same location but face different payroll taxes and minimum wage rules. Country case studies and model-consistent gravity estimates show large trade responses to tax and regulatory reforms, with an elasticity of trade in services to labor costs larger than one. The results imply that absent regulatory and fiscal harmonization, export competitiveness depends, in part, on domestic labor market policies. (JEL F14, F16, F42, H25, J22, J23, K31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of quid pro quo (technology for market access) in facilitating knowledge spillovers and quality upgrading in the Chinese automobile industry. The identification strategy exploits within-product quality variation across a rich set of quality dimensions. We find affiliated domestic automakers adopt more similar quality strengths of their joint venture partners, consistent with knowledge spillovers. Additional analysis suggests worker flows and supplier networks mediate knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers due to ownership affiliation under quid pro quo contributed 8.3 percent of the quality improvement experienced by affiliated domestic models from 2001 to 2014, relative to nonaffiliated domestic models.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Identifying the optimal set of individuals to first receive information (“seeds”) in a social network to maximize expected diffusion is a widely studied question in many settings. Several studies propose network-centrality-based heuristics to select seeds likely to increase diffusion. Here, we show that, for the classic independent cascade model of diffusion, either seeding a few more individuals at random can prompt a larger diffusion than optimal seeding or optimal seeding itself results in limited spread. These findings hold across a broad range of random networks and are supported by simulations on real-world networks. (JEL D83, D85, O12, O18, P25, P32, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the strong negative effect of higher mortgage rates on cash-out refinancing reflects substitution into other borrowing products, not large changes in total new household borrowing. We exploit plausibly exogenous changes in interest rates due to unconventional monetary policy surprises to show that changes in cash-out and other borrowing are roughly offsetting. The elasticity of new household borrowing with respect to mortgage rates is low and varies little with the borrower’s outstanding mortgage rate. Our results suggest that the cash-out refinance channel of unconventional monetary policy is weak and not path dependent. (JEL E43, E52, G21, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 100 US retirement plans and a representative UK panel, I document the impact of auto-enrollment (AE) on retirement savings at different horizons. I replicate the impact of AE on participation and contributions in the short run (at 12 months), but I show that these gains are attenuated over the medium run (at 36 months). At this longer horizon, the average savings increases are modest, though AE significantly lowers inequality in savings. To assess AE’s lifetime impact, I estimate a life cycle consumption-savings model that can fit the observed patterns with a switching cost of approximately $250, smaller than previous estimates.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A college degree offers a pathway to economic mobility for low-income students. Using a multisite randomized controlled trial combined with administrative and survey data, we demonstrate that intensive advising during high school and college significantly increases bachelor’s degree attainment among lower-income students. We leverage unique data on preadvising college preferences and causal forest methods to show that these gains are primarily driven by improvements in initial enrollment quality. Our results suggest that strategies targeting college choice may be a more effective and efficient means of increasing degree attainment than those focused solely on affordability.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study neighborhood choice using a novel research design that contrasts the move rate of homeowners who receive a new different-race neighbor immediately next-door versus slightly farther away on the same block. This approach isolates a component of preferences directly attributable to neighbors’ identities. Both Black and White homeowners are more likely to move after receiving a new different-race neighbor. Findings are robust to additional controls (e.g., income) and alternative research designs. We find evidence of heterogeneity in responses, especially associated with housing density, which has implications for understanding contemporary neighborhood racial change and prospects for maintaining stable, integrated neighborhoods.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a two-country model in which currency and bond markets are populated by different investor clienteles, and segmentation is partly overcome by arbitrageurs with limited capital. Risk premia in our model are time-varying, connected across markets, and consistent with the empirical violations of uncovered interest parity and expectations hypothesis. Through risk premia, large-scale bond purchases lower domestic and foreign bond yields and depreciate the currency, and short-rate cuts lower foreign yields, with smaller effects than bond purchases. Currency returns are disconnected from long-maturity bond returns, and yet the currency market is instrumental in transmitting bond demand shocks across countries.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a bottom-up approach to estimate the slope of the primitive form of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, which features marginal cost as the real activity variable. Using quarterly micro data on prices, costs, and output, we estimate dynamic pass-through regressions that identify the slope as a function of primitive parameters. We find a high slope for the cost-based Phillips curve, which contrasts with the low estimates of the conventional output gap–based formulation found in the literature. We reconcile by showing that the output elasticity of marginal cost is low, at least during moderate inflation periods (e.g., pre-pandemic). (JEL C51, E12, E23, E31, E32, L60)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether the quality of managers can affect public service provision in the context of public health. Using novel data from public hospitals in Chile, we show how the introduction of a competitive recruitment system and better pay for public hospital CEOs reduced hospital mortality by 8 percent. The effect is not explained by a change in patient composition. We find that the policy changed the pool of CEOs by displacing doctors with no management training in favor of CEOs who had studied management. Productivity improvements were driven by hospitals that recruited higher quality CEOs. (JEL D24, G34, I11, I18, J45, M54, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the role of nonbank lenders in the transmission of monetary policy using data on the universe of unsecured credit to firms and households in Denmark. Nonbanks increase their credit supply after a monetary contraction, both relative to banks and in absolute terms. The increase in nonbank lending is financed through increased long-term debt. A model with segmented debt markets featuring differential investor rate sensitivities rationalizes these findings. Nonbank credit insulates corporate investment and household consumption from monetary contractions, with positive spillovers extending beyond nonbank clients through industry and geographic channels.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of insurance companies in supporting resiliency in the corporate bond market. We show that during the COVID-19 liquidity crisis, insurers increased their corporate bond positions, particularly in bonds facing fire sales by mutual funds. Insurers with more stable funding were more likely to buy, and they bought more from dealers with whom they had prior trading relationships. Dealers improved their bond liquidity provision when they had trading relationships with insurers with more stable funding. Our work demonstrates that insurers can play an important role in supporting bond market resiliency during times of stress. (JEL: G10, G12, G20, G22, G23, G24)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use variation in state corporate income tax rates to re-examine the relation between taxes and corporate leverage. Contrary to prior research, corporate leverage rises after tax cuts for small private firms. An estimated dynamic equilibrium model shows that tax cuts make capital more productive and spur the use of leverage. Tax cuts also produce more distant default thresholds and lower credit spreads. These effects outweigh the lower interest tax deduction and lead to higher optimal leverage choices, especially for firms with flexible investment policies. The presence of the interest tax deduction raises consumer welfare in equilibrium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Novel Fully Online Matching Algorithm in Stochastic EnvironmentsIn many modern applications, such as ride-sharing, participants arrive and depart dynamically, requiring quick decisions about who to match and when. In “Fully Online Matching with General Stochastic Arrivals and Departures,” Li, Wang, and Yan introduce a fully online matching framework that models these real-world dynamics. Each arrival follows a known identical and independent distribution over agent types, whereas the sojourn time is unknown in advance and follows type-specific distributions with known expectations. To address this, they propose a linear programming–based algorithm that guarantees a competitive ratio of at least 0.192 under mild conditions—more than 50% better than the state-of-the-art result of 0.125. They also establish several hardness results to highlight the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. Numerical experiments further confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of their algorithm, offering new insights for decision making in stochastic and dynamic environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Resource pooling improves system efficiency drastically in large stochastic systems, but its effective implementation in decentralized systems remains relatively underexplored. This paper studies how to incentivize resource pooling when agents are self-interested, and their states are private information. Our primary motivation is applications in the design of decentralized computing markets, among others. We study a standard multiserver queueing model in which each server is associated with an [Formula: see text] queue and aims to minimize its time-average job holding and processing costs. We design a simple token-based mechanism where servers can earn tokens by offering help and spend tokens to request help from other servers, all in their self-interest. The mechanism induces a complex game among servers. We employ the fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) concept to analyze the system, combining mean-field approximation with fluid relaxation. This framework enables us to derive a closed-form characterization of servers’ FMFE strategies. We show that these FMFE strategies approximate well the servers’ rational behavior. We leverage this framework to optimize the design of the mechanism and present our main results: As the number of servers increases, the proposed mechanism incentivizes complete resource pooling—that is, the system dynamics and performance under our mechanism match those under centralized control. Finally, we show that our mechanism achieves the first-best performance even when helping others incurs higher job processing costs and remains nearly optimal in settings with heterogeneous servers.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model social media as collections of users producing and consuming content. Users value consuming content, but due to scarce attention, they may not value all content from other users. Users also value receiving attention, creating the incentive to attract an audience by producing valuable content but also through attention bartering—users mutually becoming each other’s audience. Attention bartering shapes substantially the patterns of production and consumption on social media, explains key features of social media behavior and platform decision making, and yields sharp predictions that are consistent with data we collect from #EconTwitter. We conduct Twitter and Instagram user surveys that yield additional direct evidence in support of attention bartering, and we discuss the implications of attention bartering for the design of social media platforms.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00060 .</content>

    <title>The Treasury Collateral Spread and Levered Safe-Asset Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks are vital suppliers of money-like safe assets, which they produce by issuing short-term liabilities and pledging collateral. But their ability to create safe assets varies over time as leverage constraints fluctuate. I write a simple model to describe private safe-asset production when intermediaries face leverage constraints. I directly measure leverage constraints using confidential supervisory data on high-frequency changes in the largest banks’ repurchase agreements (repos). The collateral spread—the maturity-matched yield spread between Treasuries used as repo collateral more often and Treasuries used less often—compensates for bank leverage risk and averages about 0.5 basis points, a sizable magnitude roughly equal to 60% of the five-year Treasury cheapest-to-deliver basis.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06104 .</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Precision and Human Decision: A Study of Interactive Optimization for School Schedules</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In collaboration with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), this paper introduces an interactive optimization framework to tackle complex school scheduling challenges. The choice of school start and end times is an optimization challenge, as schedules influence the district’s transportation system, and limiting the associated costs is a computationally difficult combinatorial problem. However, it is also a policy challenge, as transportation costs are far from the only consequence of school schedule changes. Policymakers need time and knowledge to balance these considerations and reach a consensus carefully; past implementations have failed because of policy issues, despite state-of-the-art optimization approaches. We first motivate our approach with a microfoundation model of the interplay between policymakers and researchers, arguing that limiting their dependency is key. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that includes (1) a fast algorithm capable of solving the school schedule problem that compares favorably to the literature and (2) an interactive optimization approach that leverages this speed to allow policymakers to explore a variety of solutions in a transparent and efficient way, facilitating the policy decision-making process. The framework led to the first optimization-driven school start time changes in the United States, updating the schedule of all 133 schools in SFUSD in 2021, with annual transportation savings exceeding $5 million. A comprehensive survey of approximately 27,000 parents and staff in 2022 provides evidence of the approach’s effectiveness.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05834 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study ethnic investing, using transaction data from Kenya’s stock exchange and CEO/board turnover. We show that a given investor invests more in a given firm when the firm is run by coethnics and earns lower risk-adjusted returns on such investments. We then model and empirically test for the aggregate impact of (i) the implied taste- or psychology-driven investor discrimination and (ii) counteracting demand- and supply-side forces. Our estimates imply that listed Kenyan firms could collectively be worth 38% more—with minority-run firms benefitting the most—if the neutral proportion of active investors increased from 4.6% to 50%.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03660 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Debt matters for oil supply elasticities. We document the resiliency of oil production to the COVID-19-related collapse in demand due to indebtedness. We use exogenous variation in the timing of debt-related payments to identify financially constrained operators. We show that more financially constrained firms cut production by less than less-constrained firms and were less likely to complete new wells. To explore the mechanisms, we use borrowing-limit cuts and credit-line drawdowns to measure access to credit, and we exploit failed hedging practices. The propagation of oil demand shocks crucially depends on the indebtedness of the oil sector. (JEL G32, D22, Q41)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many industries, buyers diversify their supplier base to manage supplier disruption risk. We investigate the importance of such diversification as a determinant of demand and supplier entry in the context of the internet backbone, the worldwide network of undersea fiber-optic cables that underpins the internet. We specify a model of international bandwidth demand and cable operators’ dynamic entry and supply choices. The model is estimated using novel data on cross-border data flows, prices, cable characteristics, and disruptions. Counterfactual analysis reveals that supplier diversification accounts for a large share of entry and surplus created between 2005 and 2021. Relative to the socially optimal level of entry, distortions due to suppliers’ inability to capture fully the social benefits of diversity are as large as distortions due to business stealing.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Capacity Configuration and Allocation under Capacity Risk: Trade-Offs between Fill Rates and Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capacity configuration and allocation problems in production networks under demand uncertainty have been extensively studied in the literature. In addition to demand uncertainty, capacity risk is also prevalent in practice. This paper considers a bipartite production system consisting of multiple plants and a set of customers located in different areas. In particular, these plants will use their configured capacities, facing capacity risk, to serve those customers who have differentiated fill-rate requirements with uncertain demands. Our objective is to optimize capacity configuration and allocation decisions by formulating the problem as a two-stage stochastic program that explicitly incorporates capacity risks and budget constraints. First, we develop a novel “randomized edge-weighted max-flow” priority rule that integrates capacity risk, penalty costs of unmet demands, and allocation costs to allocate the realized capacities to satisfy fill-rate targets, with a tunable parameter introduced to balance service levels and costs. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying plants with zero capacities and obtain some practical insights, which can help reduce the potential redundancy of the network system. When partial information and correlation of distributions are known, we implement robust optimization techniques to obtain the ranges of robust capacities under various scenarios. Some practical managerial implications are derived by theoretically discussing the impacts of capacity risk and demand correlations on these ranges. From numerical experiments, we found that the long-chain configuration no longer has the “almost-as-goodas-the-fully-flexible-network” advantage when the capacities are random. In addition, we also investigate the impacts of correlations among realized capacities or demands on the associated flexibility. Finally, some interesting and useful insights for practitioners can be obtained by analyzing the impacts of costs, fill rates, and uncertainty on the total optimal capacity and total configuration cost.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing under Consumer Habituation: The Optimality of a Familiarity-Based Threshold Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical evidence indicates that consumers experience a relative loss of excitement over time and miss their habits when refraining from consumption under repeated purchases. Despite the practices of first-time trials and welcome-back offers, how to exploit this habituation behavior through customized dynamic pricing is overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we analyze the long-run optimal customized dynamic pricing strategy in the presence of consumer habituation for time/frequency-based consumption. The consumer’s willingness to pay is determined by past consumption via the habitual level of consumption. We formulate the seller’s continuous-time profit maximization problem over an infinite horizon as an optimal control problem and derive the closed-form value function and optimal pricing strategy. We identify a key condition on the willingness-to-pay function that captures both the magnitude of the habituation effect and the saturated willingness to pay, which plays a central role in determining the seller’s optimal pricing policy. When consumers retain interest even at high levels of habitual consumption, alwayssellingby pricing at their current willingness to pay is optimal. In contrast, if consumers lose interest when saturated, the optimal policy becomes a cutoff strategy, where the seller offers the product only when consumption remains below a critical threshold and prices out consumers beyond it.We further examine the resulting pricing and consumption dynamics and characterize an equilibrium habitual level of consumption at which randomized promotions can be optimal. Furthermore, our key findings qualitatively hold under random consumer valuation, but with richer patterns. Our work provides a tractable, closed-form characterization of the optimal dynamic pricing policy under consumer habituation, offering a more nuanced understanding of the strategic implications of an inverted U-shaped willingness-to-pay.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To increase their competitiveness, firms continue to upgrade their products and to buy technology upgrade components. While firms generally know the value of technology upgrade products (components), they do not know when the upgrade solution can be produced on a massive scale, who can produce it, and what the unit production cost is when they make their purchase decisions. To obtain the upgrade solution information and to reduce their purchase costs, some firms adopt thestrategic supplier with bargainingmechanism, while other firms adopt thereverse auction with incentivemechanism. Recently, some firms (e.g., China National Petroleum Corporation) have adopted an innovative mechanism: they establish strategic partnerships with advanced suppliers and promise a proportion of the order to incentivise them to reveal the information on time. Meanwhile, they also adopt the reverse auction to determine the winning supplier and the purchase price for the remaining order to reduce purchase costs. Motivated by these firms’ practices, we propose a new procurement mechanism for technology upgrade products:the strategic auction mechanism. We analyse the optimal promised proportion of the order, the suppliers’ equilibrium policy, and the buyer’s equilibrium profit under this mechanism. In addition, we compare the performance of these three mechanisms and identify their application conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Algorithms for Online Metric Matching with Stochastic Arrivals or PredictionsHow do we match riders to drivers? Online metric matching offers a clean abstraction of this problem, where arriving riders are instantaneously matched to waiting drivers and the matching cost is measured by the pickup distance. Its challenge lies in making matching decisions without knowing the locations of future riders, for which the simple greedy approach yields suboptimal solutions. In their paper “Online Metric Matching: Beyond the Worst Case,” Yang and Yu propose a novel algorithmic framework of designing algorithms for online metric matching when given access to additional information of riders’ locations in advance. They then apply this framework to derive new algorithms when the riders’ locations are independently sampled or when an untrusted prediction of riders’ locations is provided. In the former model, their algorithms achieve improved competitive ratio and regret guarantees for various settings. In the latter model, they present an algorithm whose performance smoothly depends on the prediction error while preserving the worst-case guarantee.</content>

    <title>Collaborative Learning and Decision Making on Pricing and Recommendation: A Simple Framework for Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formulate a collaborative learning and decision-making problem involving contextual information. In current business practices, pricing and recommendation decisions often are made jointly by multiple teams in sequence. The decision-making processes for different teams can be controlled by either a centralized or decentralized planner. We propose a simple collaboration framework that integrates the learning about decision making in an unknown environment. The main challenge in a decentralized framework is that the decision-making process in other teams is unknown, but the subsequent decisions are mutually dependent. From a practical concern about high exploration costs and implementation complexity, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for centralized planners and a “greedy” + “weighted sampling” (GWS) algorithm for both centralized and decentralized planners to balance the learning and earning. We show that the exploration-free greedy algorithm can achieve the optimal rate when context diversity holds. The GWS algorithm works effectively for either centralized or decentralized planners under a much weaker condition, which we call context variation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the multiproduct pricing and ranking problem and study the model misspecification issue. We validate our results using simulations on synthetic and real data. Numerical studies show the superior performance of the two proposed frameworks for different types of planners.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine environmental, social, and governance (ESG) misreporting in the context of the UK government requirement to report gender employment ratios and pay gaps. Highlighting misreporting, many employers report a set of disclosures that are together mathematically impossible. Further, a disproportionate number of employers report perfectly balanced gender statistics, consistent with misreporting as a form of ESG-washing. Suggesting that a lack of ethical considerations encourages misreporting, employers involved in ESG controversies and who commit labor violations are more likely to misreport. Suggesting that capital market and media scrutiny discourage misreporting, employers that are the subject of an article about their gender pay gap reports and employers that receive an ESG audit or financial audit from a Big 4 auditor are less likely to misreport. Overall, our results suggest that 12%–15% of employers misreport in 2017 and 8%–11% misreport in subsequent years. Our findings highlight the importance of meaningful oversight within the context of ESG reporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05125 .</content>

    <title>Capitalism Versus Socialism: Can (or Should) Management Scholars Embrace Varieties of Socio‐Economic Systems in a Multipolar World?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an increasingly multipolar world, thisPoint–Counterpointdebate discusses the imperative for Management and Organization Studies (MOS) to embrace different contexts of socio‐economic systems, specifically varieties of socialism, and in doing so move beyond the predominant capitalist model as a central assumption in the literature. In theirPoint, Bruton, Li and Gautam argue that MOS has insufficiently embraced socialism as an empirical reality, despite nearly half of the world’s population living in nations reflecting some variety of socialism, in addition to modes of organization following an ethos closer to socialism than capitalism. This view is challenged by theCounterpointof Foss, Klein, Holmes and Terjesen. While they agree that considering institutional context is vital, they reject thePoint’sposition, question its imputing of a widespread ‘capitalist bias’, and are concerned that its ethos‐based definitions are imprecise and politically charged. Based on their productive disagreement, collectively thisPoint–Counterpointdebate underscores the imperative for greater contextualization in MOS more generally, and in entrepreneurship research more specifically, and that organizational goals beyond pure financial profit maximization warrant deeper scholarly attention. This introduction concludes by sketching future research avenues, including configurational institutional analysis, exploring collective motivation in entrepreneurship, and analysing the mechanisms of state control.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Micromanagement (MM) is a popular topic in management circles, where its negative reputation is palpable, and yet academics have not shared this interest. As a result, our understanding of MM is deficient, marred by disjointed definitions and paradoxical views. Our research aims to clarify the construct and measurement of MM through a series of five studies that (1) define the MM construct, (2) develop a psychometrically reliable and valid measure, and (3) validate a preliminary nomological network. Based on combined deductive and inductive approaches, we establish a comprehensive construct definition of MM. Subsequently, we develop and validate a nine-item Micromanagement Scale (MMS-9). Drawing on data from eight distinct samples encompassing 1,723 individuals employed across diverse industries, we found that (a) MM is a hierarchical construct comprising three related core attributes (i.e., controlling, close monitoring, detail focus) and three key features (i.e., excessive, sustained, unnecessary), (b) the MMS-9 exhibits nomological validity, as evidenced by its significant relationships with theorized antecedents (e.g., low trust and leader-member exchange) and consequences (e.g., high turnover intentions and emotional exhaustion), and (c) the MMS-9 demonstrates discriminant and incremental validity against relevant orbiting leadership constructs (i.e., authoritarian leadership, participative leadership, empowering leadership, initiating structure, directive leadership, and abusive supervision). We discuss the implications of the MMS-9’s availability for advancing the study of micromanagement, with particular focus on potential avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>It’s Different: Examining the Effect of HRM Investments on Employee Downsizing Following Mergers and Acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although some scholars in strategic human resource management (SHRM) research have suggested that HRM investments can be effective in reducing the negative repercussions of employee downsizing, other scholars have argued that such HRM investments could convey contradictory messages to employees, resulting in more negative employee reactions and decreased firm performance. In this research, we addressed this unsettled question by looking into the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) context, where we theorized that the acquiring firm’s HRM investments can positively moderate the negative effect of employee downsizing on firm performance by invoking positive sensemaking processes from remaining acquired firm employees. Moreover, the positive sensemaking effects of HRM investments extend beyond remaining acquired firm employees to influence the overall performance of the merged firm. We examined established HRM investments by acquiring firms prior to the M&amp;A and additional HRM investments made after the M&amp;A. Using a representative sample of 5,467 firm-year observations from 1,214 U.S. publicly traded firms between 2002 and 2018, we found that both pre- and post-acquisition HRM investments by acquiring firms mitigate the negative effect of employee downsizing following M&amp;A on firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for both research and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Feeling appreciated is integral to developing and sustaining high-quality relationships, yet many employees do not feel appreciated at work. Drawing on risk regulation theory for interdependent relationships, we developed a risk regulation model of supervisor gratitude expression, felt appreciation, and subordinate voice. We propose that when a supervisor’s agentic or communal gratitude expression aligns with a subordinate’s preference, the subordinate will experience greater felt appreciation and thus engage more in voice—a relationally risky behavior. First, we followed a five-step scale-development process using four distinct samples to create and validate measures of supervisors’ agentic and communal gratitude expression and subordinates’ corresponding preferences. We then tested our model in a multiwave, multisource field survey with 124 supervisor–subordinate dyads. We found that the congruence (incongruence) between supervisor gratitude expression and subordinate preference was positively (negatively) related to subordinate felt appreciation and subsequent voice, with distinct patterns emerging for supervisor agentic and communal expression. Further, in two supplementary experiments, we demonstrated that felt appreciation promotes voice via perceived regard and perceived reduction of relational risk. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, highlighting the importance of distinguishing the two types of supervisor gratitude expressions and their responsiveness to subordinate preferences while outlining promising avenues for research on gratitude and felt appreciation at work.</content>

    <title>Bottom‐up effects of female strategic leadership: Firm performance effects through employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have found that female representation in strategic leadership is often positively associated with firm performance, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Prior explanations emphasize top‐down effects, considering how female leaders shape strategic decision‐making or influence legitimacy. We propose a complementary, bottom‐up view: female top managers foster employee participation, which is positively associated with firm performance. Using a unique panel dataset from South Korea, we find that female representation in top management is linked to higher employee participation, which mediates its relationship with firm performance. The benefits of employee participation are especially pronounced in firms with innovation‐oriented or labor‐intensive strategies. By integrating micro‐level employee behaviors with macro‐level firm outcomes, our study shows how female strategic leaders contribute to firm performance through a top‐enabled, bottom‐up process.Managerial SummaryWhy do firms with more women in top management perform better? Our study suggests that one important pathway lies in how female executives may foster employee participation. Drawing on a unique panel dataset from South Korea, we find that organizations with more women in top management tend to have higher levels of employee participation in decision‐making, and that such participation is associated with stronger performance outcomes. This effect is especially evident in firms that depend on innovation or human capital, where employee input and commitment are particularly valuable. By highlighting how female strategic leaders help create conditions that elevate employee voice, our findings reveal a bottom‐up process through which strategic leadership diversity may support improved organizational performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Considering human motivation, is it more effective to assign work tasks to shop floor workers or let them choose among a set of open tasks? This paper reports the results of a field experiment conducted with a manufacturer that uses wearable devices to distribute shop floor tasks. Drawing on theory on human motivation, we analyze 66,233 machine status reports and 31,429 work tasks completed in two manufacturing plants in Germany and Italy. We rely on a Difference-in-Differences approach in a 13-week-long field experiment. The results show that allowing workers to choose their next task shows no aggregate productivity difference but reveals heterogeneous behavioral effects. We find that workers respond more slowly to tasks (response time), but once accepted, tasks are completed faster (completion time). We discuss the potentially canceling effects and uncover evidence for behavioral mechanisms such as social loafing. This study has significant consequences for production managers in charge of implementing choice-based digital task assignment systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gaming industry has emerged as a critical force in the digital content economy, yet managing user behavior to drive sustained activity and monetization remains a complex operational challenge. In this study, we propose a two-layer Hidden Markov Model to capture users’ gameplay and payment behaviors by constructing a play-then-pay chain that links user engagement to subsequent purchase intention dynamics. Drawing on a real-world dataset, we uncover three levels of engagement states measuring the degree of stickiness with the focal game, as well as two levels of purchase intention states describing one’s willingness to pay. We find that a higher engagement state is associated with a volatile transition pattern and leads to a higher upward transition tendency in purchase intention, while low and medium engagement states tend to maintain a low purchase intention state. We also examine several factors that affect the transitions of these psychological states. The analysis reveals that user activity in same-type games enhances upward transitions only among users in the medium engagement state, without affecting users in the high engagement state, and exhibits no significant effect on purchase intentions. In contrast, user activity in different types of games has a negative effect on users in both low and high engagement states. Our state-dependent outcomes suggest that the managers’ strategies are more effective when targeted toward users with low engagement and purchase intention states. Further experimental analysis supports the effectiveness of the proposed play-then-pay chain for predicting users’ behaviors. Our policy simulation demonstrates that traffic subsidization effectively redirects user attention to the focal game, with interventions targeting different-type games yielding greater improvements in propensities for both gameplay and payment behavior compared to same-type games. Our work provides managerial implications for platform managers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has enabled IoT device manufacturers to collect consumer usage data (IoT data) whenever their devices are in use. Our paper examines the following setting: A manufacturer collects IoT data and decides whether to share it with a retailer, while consumers remain concerned about their privacy; the retailer, in turn, can leverage the shared data for cross-selling by investing in data-mining efforts that transform raw data into actionable insights. This aspect of data mining differentiates our study from traditional research on information sharing. Beyond selling through the existing retail channel, the manufacturer also has the option to establish a direct channel, thereby encroaching on the retailer’s market. Our analysis reveals several key insights. First, when the manufacturer both encroaches and shares IoT data, we observe a counterintuitive positive effect of the channel substitution rate: As the substitution rate increases, both the manufacturer and the retailer may see higher profits. Second, while the manufacturer always chooses to encroach when data sharing is absent, its motivation to do so weakens when it shares IoT data. Finally, we find that an increase in the value of IoT data can unexpectedly lead to a decline in the retailer’s profit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper “Foresee the Next Line: Customer Strategies and Information Disclosure in Tandem Queues” examines how queue-length information affects customer behavior in multistage services, such as visiting the Apple Store—where you first wait to check in and then wait for a technician. It focuses on a two-stage tandem queue: an admission queue followed by a treatment queue. In the fully observable model, customers see both queues before entering the system, and the equilibrium joining strategy depends on the exact queue lengths rather than just their sum. In the partially observable model—which is more common in practice—customers initially see only the first queue and find the second queue’s length after completing the first stage. In this case, a threshold equilibrium emerges. Comparing models, the partially observable version generally yields higher throughput but lower social welfare. Results combine exact analysis in special regimes with extensive numerical computations.</content>

    <title>Does Personality Similarity Influence the Formation of Auditor-in-Charge–Client Relationships and Audit Quality? Evidence from Swedish Military Conscription Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of personality similarity in the formation of auditor-in-charge (AIC)–client management dyads and the development of a collaborative relationship in auditing engagements. We apply the principle of homophily from sociology, that is, the attraction of individuals with similar traits to one another, to the formation of supplier–customer dyads in auditing engagements. Our analyses suggest that AIC–management personality similarity increases the likelihood of dyad formation and facilitates client retention. Using an instrumental variable approach, we further find evidence that AIC–chief executive officer (CEO) personality similarity enhances audit quality, and that this effect is stronger for clients with higher misreporting risk and at the beginning of the AIC–client tenure relationship. Among publicly listed clients, where chief financial officer (CFO) data are available, we find that AIC–CFO personality similarity plays a more important role in AIC–client matching and audit outcomes than AIC–CEO personality similarity. Collectively, our results suggest that a personality homophily-based relationship facilitates collaboration in auditing engagements, ultimately enhancing audit quality. Overall, our evidence highlights the benefit of interpersonal relationships in the production of audit services.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Penn State Smeal College of Business, the Handelsbanken Jan Wallanders and Tom Hedelius Foundation [Grants P25-0334 and W21-0009], the Torsten Söderbergs Foundation [Grant ET4/17], and the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets at the Stockholm School of Economics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04195 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees identify with multiple groups at work, each with distinct values and behavioral expectations. Though the identification literature argues that the relative effects of different identification groups vary depending on their subjective importance and situational relevance, identification is still largely conceptualized as stable, independent, and static. This ignores how different identifications might fluctuate in salience throughout the day and how they might influence each other. We extend the identification literature through the development of a theoretical model of dynamic identification—demonstrating that workplace conflict is a primary mechanism through which identification fluctuates, as well as the simultaneous effects of different identifications (i.e., team and organization) on important workplace outcomes. In a multistudy approach including two ESM studies and supplemental experiments, we demonstrate that increased conflict in a focal group reduced focal group identification salience and that this effect was strengthened when nonfocal group conflict was low, such that the nonfocal identification represented a “greener pasture” compared to the focal group.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the emergence of new technologies (e.g., online payment systems) and new service contexts (e.g., app-based services), the use of tip recommendations is becoming increasingly prevalent. Based on one large secondary dataset analysis (176,237 food delivery orders) and nine experiments, this research identifies an effective and easily implementable tip recommendation design—materially referenced tip recommendations (ie, referencing a product that financially equates to the suggested tip amount) to increase tips. The effect of materially referenced tip recommendations is sequentially driven by the vivid mental imagery of how the requested tips could be used by the recipient (ie, the consequences of tipping for the recipient) and the heightened perception that tipping serves as a meaningful expression of gratitude to the recipient. This effect is attenuated when the referenced product is perceived as inappropriate for expressing gratitude to the tip recipient.</content>

    <title>Strategic Drivers of Core Expansion on Software Platforms: Evidence from Apple iOS</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Software platforms rely on a core-periphery structure; platform owners provide foundational code that third-party developers extend with complementary software. This structure creates strong incentives for platform owners to cooperate with third-party developers. Yet, platform firms, like Apple, intermittently expand their core by integrating peripheral functionality—for instance, flashlight or screen-time tracking in iOS. If ecosystems thrive on cooperation, why do platform owners expand into niches at the apparent expense of developers? Using a comprehensive data set of all Apple iOS core expansions from 2012 to 2020, we find that expansions systematically target underperforming niches—those with low user satisfaction, limited innovation activity, and high market concentration. Stand-alone apps tend to occur in niches with low innovation, whereas integrated core features focus on niches with low user satisfaction and high concentration. For policymakers, these insights inform regulatory discussions on platform power and the design of public interventions. For platform owners and third-party developers, the findings highlight characteristics of ecosystem niches that are vulnerable to core expansion, supporting strategic decisions regarding cooperation, competition, and innovation investment. By linking niche characteristics to core expansion strategies, this study provides actionable guidance for regulating and managing evolving platform ecosystems.</content>

    <title>The Refugee Journey: An Exploration of the Role of Organizations and Psychological Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Throughout history, both human-made crises and natural disasters have displaced populations, forcing people to leave their homes. This not only results in lasting scars on those who flee but can also profoundly impact entire societies. Drawing from the fields of organizational studies, migration studies, and psychology, we argue that understanding the long-term effects of refugee migration requires a comprehensive examination of the entire refugee journey. During pre-, mid-, and postmigration phases, organizational actors play a pivotal role in shaping refugees’ individual and collective experiences. At the individual level, refugees may experience posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic growth. At the collective level, transgenerational trauma evolves into a shared memory, profoundly influencing the long-term outcomes of refugee migration, which is intersected by coping skills and spillover-crossover effects from work to family. By highlighting the intricate interplay between these psychological processes and organizations, we shed light on how much contemporary society has been—and will continue to be—shaped by the opportunities extended to, or withheld from, refugees. We underscore the imperative for organizational scholarship to more clearly theorize refugee migration as distinct from broader migration phenomena and outline a path forward for research, policy, and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demand in the Shadows: Proxy-Based Solutions for Smarter PricingUnderstanding how price affects customer demand is a cornerstone of data-driven pricing, but traditional approaches often struggle under endogeneity because of the presence of confounding factors. In the paper “Proxy-Aided Demand Learning with an Application to Various Pricing Problems,” Shen and Cui tackle this challenge by leveraging ideas from proximal causal inference. They introduce a framework that incorporates proxy variables—categorized into treatment and outcome types—to enable reliable identification and estimation of customer demand. Central to their method is the use of a bridge function that allows accurate recovery of potential sales at different price points. Besides theoretical and managerial insights, the paper demonstrates practical applications in both static and contextual pricing, with the proposed algorithms applied to a real-world e-commerce data set. Tellingly, the proposed framework offers a promising new direction for practitioners aiming to optimize pricing with confounded data.</content>

    <title>Combining Forecasts from Multiple Experts for Multiple Variables</title>
    <updated>2025-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Zhi Chen, Long Zhao</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new method for combining point forecasts from multiple experts across multiple variables to improve inference about an unknown variable. Traditional aggregation methods combine forecasts for each variable separately (we refer to these methods as separate inference methods). However, in practice, each expert frequently provides a forecast for each variable across multiple variables. Because forecast errors can be correlated across the variables, the decision maker may additionally benefit from pooling forecasts for the other variables (we refer to our proposed method as pooled inference). Our model assumes that the forecast error arises from multiple sources of randomness, including a variable-specific factor, an expert-specific factor, a common factor, and idiosyncratic noise. When the covariance structure of the forecast errors is known, we show that the pooled inference is structurally equivalent to the separate inference but with reduced idiosyncratic noise, thereby allowing for more effective weighting of experts’ forecasts. When the covariance structure is unknown, we derive the optimal form for the consensus forecast under the pooled inference, which can be easily implemented. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the pooled inference can outperform widely used separate inference methods in some forecasting environments. Additionally, even when pooling a large number of variables—necessitating the handling of high-dimensional covariance matrices—the pooled inference remains computationally manageable.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The research of Z.

    <title>CEO Pay Ratio Disclosures and Changes in Employee Pay Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether CEO pay ratio disclosures were informative to employees about their own pay by estimating the impact of the disclosures on employee pay satisfaction. Exploiting the staggered timing of the pay ratio disclosures, we find that employee pay satisfaction increased after their firms’ disclosures as measured by their ratings of their firms’ compensation and benefits on Glassdoor. We show that these findings are not driven by alternative information in proxy statements, general trends in employee satisfaction, ratings manipulation, or concurrent changes in employee pay levels. Instead, we posit that the new information in the disclosures about median worker pay levels caused employees to perceive their own pay levels more favorably. Consistent with this explanation, we find that the increases in pay satisfaction are greatest within firms that had relatively small median worker pay levels and those that had relatively opaque pay information environments before the disclosure. Overall, our findings reveal a positive externality of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s mandate on human capital disclosures, potentially informing future policy making.This paper was accepted by Jan Bouwens, accounting.Funding: The authors thank Boston College, Tsinghua University, Tulane University, the University of Arizona, the Carol Lavin Bernick Faculty Grant Program, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72402110, 72442014] for providing financial support for this project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08151 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a no-arbitrage framework for stochastic discount factors (SDFs) that satisfy convex pricing constraints in markets characterized by a wide range of trading frictions. We demonstrate a duality relationship connecting minimum dispersion SDFs to portfolio optimization problems with penalty functions directly capturing the underlying frictions. Empirically, we examine how mispricing impacts the SDF’s effectiveness in explaining both cross-sectional and time series variation in asset returns. We find that a minimum-variance SDF, constructed by combining the capital asset pricing model SDF with a portfolio that constrains the mispricing of nonmarket risks, achieves a favorable tradeoff between time series and cross-sectional fit.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05750 .</content>

    <title>Innovate or litigate? The dual impacts of multimarket contacts on global competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study, grounded in the multimarket competition, knowledge management, and technological change literature, investigates how multimarket contacts among multinational enterprises—i.e., the extent to which rival multinational enterprises meet simultaneously in multiple countries—shape their innovation and patent litigation decisions in host countries. We propose that the degree of multimarket contacts a multinational enterprise has with its competitors in a host country may restrain it from aggressively launching product and technological innovations in that country due to a fear of cross-country retaliation. However, increased multimarket contacts also facilitate knowledge diffusion, heightening the risk of imitation, and consequently enhance the multinational enterprise’s patent litigation intensity—a means to protect knowledge-based resources—in that country. Moreover, we examine how two features of the host-country technological environment—technological ferment (an era of intense technical variation following a technological discontinuity until a dominant design emerges) and home–host country differences in intellectual property protection—moderate these relationships. We test our hypotheses using a dataset of 85 mobile phone vendors, which includes data on their products and technological innovations and litigation cases in 46 countries between 2003 and 2015. This study sheds light on the interplay among multinational enterprises’ multimarket contacts, innovation, and patent litigation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically neural facial reenactment (NFR), can address the limitations of dubbing and subtitling in adapting foreign films. Using action design research and guided by presence theory, we codeveloped and evaluated an NFR process during the English adaptation of the Polish feature film The Champion. Unlike conventional dubbing, which often disrupts immersion through poor lip-sync or script changes, NFR preserves the original actors’ performances, aligning them with new dialogue. Independent broadcast-quality assessments confirmed technical validity, and subsequent commercial distribution on a major streaming platform demonstrated scalability and audience acceptance. From this process, we derived six design principles: avoid forced script changes, respect creative intent, minimize intrusive technology, reduce training data requirements, enable flexible audience access, and codesign with existing creative structures. These principles offer a replicable template for the responsible researching and developing of AI in information systems. For practice, the findings show that NFR can improve cultural accessibility and create new creative and technical roles rather than displacing talent. For policy, the study highlights the importance of codesign, transparency, and preserving artistic integrity when integrating AI into global cultural products.</content>

    <title>How to Tell a (News) Story? Quantifying the Impact of News Format and Storytelling on Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media has transformed how people consume news, making storytelling design as important as headline design. We examine three storytelling design features—narrativity (linear versus summary first), emotional sequence (good to bad versus bad to good), and reading level (simple versus complex)—and show that their effects on engagement depend on both news format and audience motivation.We find that effective engagement requires conditional rather than universal rules. For satirical content, humor enhances engagement mainly among motivated audiences, where higher narrativity and complex language paired with bad-to-good emotional sequences work best. For less motivated audiences, simpler satire is more effective when presented in summary-first form with good-to-bad sequences. For traditional news, prior work suggests that simple language helps; whereas we find this to be generally true, our results show that when complex language is unavoidable, pairing it with linear narrativity and bad-to-good sequences can enhance engagement. These results provide guidance for publishers who must balance clarity, complexity, and audience expectations.Beyond news, our findings generalize to videos, podcasts, and interactive media, where storytelling design similarly shaped engagement. We also demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can generate controlled story variations, enabling creators to scale production and platforms to optimize recommendations in audience-specific ways.</content>

    <title>Contract Selection and Piracy Surveillance for Video Platforms in the Age of Social Media</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pirated video clips, a new form of piracy, have spread rapidly in recent years with the vigorous development of short‐video social media platforms such asTikTokandDouyin. This has led to a huge loss of revenue for the film and TV drama industry where the negative economic impact trickles down from legitimate video platforms to content creators. As video platforms fight back against copyright infringement, they need to decide how much effort to invest in detecting and taking down pirated video clips that emerge on social media platforms. In addition, they need to decide whether a lump sum or unit price contract should be used to secure the playing rights for a video from the content creator. A content creator has no incentive to engage in piracy surveillance together with the video platform after signing a lump sum contract but has an incentive to do so after signing a unit price contract because he/she would receive royalties each time someone watches the copyrighted video. Using an analytical model framework, we find that the video platform should use a unit price contract when production of the video is less costly for the same quality (e.g., music‐based, horror, and romance movies) but a lump sum contract when production is costly (e.g., Sci‐fi, animation, and fantasy genres). We show that in equilibrium, the total surveillance effort between the video platform and the content creator is smaller and the video platform charges customers less to watch the copyrighted video under the lump sum contract compared to the unit price contract. As a result, the lump sum contract not only achieves higher consumer surplus compared to the unit price contract but also leads to a higher percentage of customers legally accessing the video program. Finally, the content creator's revenue is the same under both contracts, but the content creator may prefer the lump sum contract because it attracts more (legal or illegal) viewers and the increased visibility could be beneficial in the long run.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Paradoxes in the Sharing Economy: Empirical Evidence from Airbnb</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Challenging conventional epistemological stances, we unravel two paradoxes of communication strategies in the emerging context of sharing economy. Specifically, the conformity–distinctiveness paradox asserts that differing from hotels improves hosts’ economic performance, but such economic benefit diminishes when deviating from the norms in hospitality settings. The economic–social paradox propounds that positioning away from hotels improves social performance but may not result in optimal economic gains. Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of strategic categorization and optimal distinctiveness, we collect and analyze data from a sample of Airbnb listings. Utilizing multiple estimation models and identification strategies, we find that hosts can improve their economic performance by differing from hotels, but such economic gains diminish beyond a certain point. Furthermore, deviating from hotels also increases hosts’ social performance, especially when direct host–guest interactions occur in shared apartments. Our empirical findings provide compelling evidence for the two paradoxes in the context of sharing economy, extend the discourse on strategic categorization, and elucidate the effects of listing narratives conveyed through social technologies. This study also sheds new light on how operations management and service providers can exploit the communicative and linguistic perspectives of user-generated content.</content>

    <title>Understanding of the Dynamics of Mobile Reading: An HMM Model of User Engagement and Content Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding consumers’ engagement and subsequent content consumption behavior in the mobile context is critical to mobile app providers. In this paper, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the dynamics of users’ engagement states and consumption decisions on the number of books/chapters read and the amount of money spent. Our method allows us to simultaneously capture three interdependent usage behaviors using a single integrated model and identify the impact of content loading time and previous reading behavior on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption. We calibrate the model using a tap stream data set of individual users’ reading activities on a mobile app. Our analysis reveals three distinct engagement states, a low state with inactive users, a medium state with users sampling books, and a high state with users reading intensively. Furthermore, we find that content loading time has higher negative impacts on high-state users in state transitioning than medium-state users. In contrast, the days that elapsed since the last visit has a similar negative impact on the users in the high and medium states. The effect of usage frequency on users in state transitioning is always positive. We have also identified the weekend effect and social influence on users’ reading outcomes. Finally, our simulations quantify the shortened content loading time and the days elapsed since the last visit on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption decisions, which generate important managerial implications for app providers.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Signaling Blockchain‐Based Track and Trace on Consumer Purchases: Insights From a Quasi‐Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain‐based track and trace (BCT) is increasingly adopted in the retail supply chain. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence quantifying the effects of BCT on consumer purchases or examining the heterogeneity of these effects with varying product‐related characteristics. Employing transactional data from a leading global e‐retailer that contains 540 stock keeping units (SKUs), we design a quasi‐natural experiment spanning 80 weeks to estimate the signaling effect of BCT (i.e., disclosure of the BCT to consumers) on consumer purchases. Drawing on the signaling theory, we propose that BCT can serve as an effective and reliable signal of the product quality and trustworthiness of the retailer. Our research uncovers significant positive effects of BCT on the average purchase quantity per buyer, the total number of buyers, the number of new buyers, and the number of unique visitors to the traced products. We also find nuanced moderation effects for two product‐related characteristics—namely, consumer review inconsistency and product origins—on the influence of BCT on consumer purchases. Specifically, the signal effectiveness of BCT is stronger for products with more inconsistent customer reviews that indicate greater information asymmetry. The effect of BCT for products sourced globally is magnified because of the high BCT signal reliability attributed to the unique properties of the blockchain. The heterogeneous effects of BCT by varying product‐related characteristics can inform managers in selecting the right products to implement BCT.</content>

    <title>Taxes and Executive Pay: Evidence from Nonqualified Deferred Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the influence of tax deductibility on decisions to defer executive compensation by exploiting a plausibly exogenous tax change that increases the deductibility of the chief financial officer’s (CFO’s) nonperformance-based compensation, with no impact on the nontax determinants of deferrals. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I find that CFO deferred compensation significantly decreases after the tax change, relative to the deferrals of the chief executive officer (CEO) and the highest paid non-CEO and non-CFO executive in the same firm. This finding is more pronounced for firms with higher marginal tax rates and thus greater tax benefits of deferrals. Additional tests show that tax deductibility also influences firms’ decisions on nonperformance-based compensation and that CFO total pay appears to decline in response to decreased deferrals.This paper was accepted by Shivaram Rajgopal, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01483 .</content>

    <title>Spectral Volume Models: Universal High-Frequency Periodicities in Intraday Trading Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop spectral volume models to systematically estimate, explain, and exploit the high-frequency periodicity in intraday trading activities using Fourier analysis. The framework consistently recovers periodicities at specific frequencies in three steps, despite their low signal-to-noise ratios. This reveals persistent and universal high-frequency periodicities in the United States and Chinese stock markets in recent years, and the dominant frequencies explain a significant fraction of the total variance of intraday volumes. We provide evidence that this phenomenon likely reflects the behaviors of trading algorithms with repeated and regular trading instructions. Finally, we demonstrate that uncovering such high-frequency periodicities improves intraday volume predictions and volume weighted average price execution qualities, yields insights for price informativeness of algorithmic trading, and generates excess returns.This paper was accepted by William Lin Cong, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant 2022YFA1007900], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12271013 and 72342004], and the Peking University’s Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06215 .</content>

    <title>Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street? Investor Participation in Market Manipulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Price distortions created by so-called “pump-and-dump” schemes are well documented, but relatively little is known about the investors in these schemes. By examining 470 pump-and-dump schemes and a large data set of trading records for over 110,000 individual investors from a major German bank, we provide comprehensive evidence on the participation rate, the magnitude of the investments, the losses, and the characteristics of the individuals who invest in such schemes. Participation is quite common, with nearly 8% of active retail investors participating in at least one pump-and-dump losing on average nearly 30%. We identify several distinct types of participating investors, some of which (e.g., speculating day trader) should not be viewed as falling prey to the schemes. We also show that portfolio composition and past trading behavior better explain scheme participation than demographics. Last, we document longer-lasting effects on participating investors beyond their immediate financial losses. Our analysis highlights that an effective regulatory response to pump-and-dump schemes requires understanding who invests in such schemes and why, as, for instance, not all investors are likely to be dissuaded from investing by traditional regulatory disclosures.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Clark Center for Global Markets at the University of Chicago and the Danish Finance Institute.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03181 .</content>

    <title>To Claim or Not To Claim? Hidden Costs of Business Page Claiming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many digital platforms encourage small business owners to “claim” their pages to improve visibility and connect with customers. Yet, despite its apparent benefits and zero financial cost, many pages remain unclaimed. Using a unique data set from Yelp and a staggered difference-in-differences design, this study reveals a hidden downside of business page claiming; average customer ratings drop by 10.3%, driven by more one-star reviews and fewer five-star reviews. Customers also write longer, more negative reviews and address owners more directly about service issues. These findings indicate that claiming a business page signals owner presence and raises customer expectations for responsiveness, which many small businesses may not be equipped to meet. For practitioners, the results highlight that business page claiming, although free, is not costless; it creates reputational risk if service quality or responsiveness falls short of heightened expectations. Owners should claim their pages only when ready to actively monitor feedback or engage in managerial responses. Platforms should also communicate these potential consequences to businesses and design tools that help owners manage customer interactions more effectively.</content>

    <title>How Important Is Pay and What Are the Effects (Positive and Negative) of Pay for Performance?: Evaluating Claims and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compensation plays a pivotal role in shaping employee behavior, motivation, and well‐being. Although extant research has explored various dimensions of compensation, questions about how important pay is to employees and concerns (on the part of employers and/or employees) about the unintended negative (in addition to intended positive) consequences of pay and pay for performance (PFP) decisions remain. For employers, these include claims that PFP can provoke undesirable employee behaviors and undermine employee intrinsic motivation and creativity, and that PFP‐related organizational change is difficult to implement successfully. For employees, concerns include claims that PFP programs negatively affect employee health, well‐being, and financial security. We address and evaluate these concerns in light of theory and evidence and emphasize the need to examine not only the potential negative but also the potential positive consequences of pay and PFP decisions. The strength of PFP effects is greater to the degree that pay is important to employees. Further, in the global context, where much of the world has lower income and higher poverty rates than in the higher productivity economies (e.g., the United States, Europe), we often study pay's importance and thus PFP's impact may be greater.</content>

    <title>Microstructure of “Both/And”: SMART Strategies for Simultaneously Engaging Paradoxical Opposites</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on organizational paradoxes emphasizes the importance of both/and thinking and action. Yet, while often treated as a unitary concept, both/and has been interpreted and operationalized in diverse ways—such as ambidexterity, transcendence, Yin-Yang balancing, and Zhong-Yong middle way. To enhance conceptual clarity and coherence, this paper decomposes the notion of both/and and identifies generic strategies for simultaneously engaging paradoxical opposites. I begin by reviewing individual responses and prior classifications of responses to paradoxical tensions, which reveals five distinct responses beyond either/or logics. Building on these, I develop a typology that specifies and relates five variants of both/and thinking. These are organized into five ideal types—superficial Either-And, multiversal Both-Or, ambivalent Both-And, reconciliatory Both-Nor, and transcendent Neither-And—collectively forming the acronym SMART. I illustrate the application of the SMART framework by analyzing how organizations navigate the profitability versus responsibility tension, a paradox central to modern business practice. I conclude the paper by identifying the limitations of the present study and avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>When Local Learning Scales: Entrepreneurs’ Initial Users and Market Expansion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entering new markets is crucial for technology startups to scale, yet these ventures often face high uncertainty about demand in these markets. This study examines how the composition of initial users shapes startups’ new market growth amid such uncertainty. It theorizes that startups face a learning tradeoff when targeting a foreign market: Local initial users, who are more familiar to the startups, provide clearer signals due to shared language and norms; however, more representative foreign users provide more transferable insights about the target market. Using variation in feature timing on a product platform, this study finds that startups with a higher share of local initial users prior to platform launch experience greater growth in foreign users afterward. This effect is stronger when startups are based in more linguistically homogeneous countries and operate in globally standardized digital product categories, settings where the clarity benefits of local signals outweigh their transferability costs. In contrast to prior work suggesting that startups should begin with target users, this study reveals contexts when more familiar initial users can better foster new market growth and prevent premature scaling.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17983 .</content>

    <title>Behavioral Simulation of Blockchain-Enabled Market for Supplier Capacity Trading Among Retailers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain distribution system and investigate experimentally operations of markets where retailers can trade digital claims (tokens) on the supplier’s capacity. Subjects play the role of retailers, have heterogeneous valuations of goods, face random demands, and buy tokens on the supplier’s capacity. Following demand realization, retailers trade tokens with each other in markets implemented as double-sided, single-price, blind, batch auctions. We compare six behavioral treatments, featuring two wholesale prices and three market sizes. As expected, markets reduce leftovers and shortages. Interestingly, market-clearing prices are anchored to wholesale prices and do not signal the value of goods in large markets. Players deploy novel ordering and trading strategies that differ from the transshipment literature. We identify strategies by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In one strategy, players buy a few claims and, after demand realization, use the market to satisfy it. Other players buy more claims than the maximum demand and, once demand is known, sell their excess on the market. Both strategies reduce costs from demand uncertainty but expose players to liquidity and mistakes risks. A third strategy, in which players order from the supplier initially as if expecting the market to be cleared cooperatively, is more profitable. This strategy diversifies demand and market risks. The introduction of markets causes the “pull-to-the-mean” effect and increases order variability. Thus, markets can cause the Bullwhip Effect. Retailers’ and the supply chain’s average profits are higher with markets, but suppliers with low wholesale prices suffer from lower revenues because of the pull-to-the-mean effect.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03771 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Direct experience of a peer’s punishment might have a sobering effect above and beyond deterrence (information about punishments). We test this mechanism in China, studying the reactions to listed state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) punishments for fraudulent loan guarantees by firms in the same location (peers) and nonpeer firms across SOEs and non-SOEs. After experiencing SOEs’ punishments, peer SOEs cut their loan guarantees by more than nonpeer SOEs and peer non-SOEs even if information and local economic shocks are common to all firms. The reaction is stronger for peer SOEs whose CEOs have higher career concerns and/or face lower costs of reducing loan guarantees.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03309 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the successes of deep learning, we propose a class of neural network–based discrete choice models, called RUMnets, inspired by the random utility maximization (RUM) framework. This model formulates the agents’ random utility function using a sample average approximation. We show that RUMnets sharply approximate the class of RUM discrete choice models: Any model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a RUMnet. Reciprocally, any RUMnet is consistent with the RUM principle. Our approach is closely related to ranking-based models and mixtures of multinomial logits proposed in previous literature in a more general contextual setting. We derive an upper bound on the generalization error of RUMnets fitted on choice data and provide theoretical insights on their ability to predict choices on new unseen data depending on critical parameters of the data set and architecture. The models are estimated by leveraging open-source libraries for training neural networks. We find that RUMnets are competitive against several choice modeling and machine learning methods in terms of predictive accuracy on two real-world data sets. We also conduct synthetic experiments that isolate the effects of each architecture component.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an economic setting to rationalize the use of the “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator” (LASSO) in estimating asset returns. In this setting, multiple traders engage in trading based on information extracted from historical asset prices. Facing model uncertainty in forecasting asset returns, these traders adopt robust-trading strategies. Within this context, the use of LASSO for estimating asset returns emerges endogenously as an equilibrium outcome. We further extend our analysis to rationalize the application of elastic-net estimation. Although LASSO-type strategies enhance traders’ profits by mitigating competition among them, they also introduce biases in trading decisions, which can adversely affect profitability. This dual effect highlights the nuanced tradeoffs associated with employing such estimation techniques in financial markets.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on AI for Finance and Business Decisions.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2021-0040] and the Bank of Canada [Fellowship].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06127 .</content>

    <title>Breaking Barriers: Scaffolding Social‐Symbolic Work for Women’s Economic Empowerment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances the understanding of Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) in non‐Western contexts by theorizing how social‐symbolic work facilitates empowerment despite entrenched institutional and cultural constraints. Drawing on a qualitative study into the establishment of Kuwait’s first women’s business incubator, we explore how female intrapreneurs engaged in three interrelated forms of social‐symbolic work – on selves, organizations, and institutions – to foster women’s entrepreneurship. These scaffolded efforts culminated in the creation of a new social‐symbolic object: the Al Salam business incubator. This incubator functioned not only as a physical space for women to launch and grow businesses, but also as a potent symbol of institutional transformation within a culturally traditional environment. We propose a process model of scaffolding social‐symbolic work, demonstrating how catalytic partnerships and dynamic interdependencies across multiple levels of social life can collectively dismantle systemic barriers to female entrepreneurship. By conceptualizing scaffolding as a temporal and integrative process, this study contributes to WEE scholarship and deepens theoretical insights into social‐symbolic work by revealing how diverse forms of work interlock to shape new identities, practices, and institutional arrangements.</content>

    <title>How Institutional Context Affects Narcissistic CEOs’ CSR Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narcissistic CEOs have been found to invest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) in prior research, but the empirical results are not straightforward. To address this, we bring in the institutional context as a moderator. We build on neo-institutional theory to argue that the institutional context shapes what audiences value and find legitimate in terms of CSR behaviors: Corporate philanthropy, a form of tactical CSR, is appreciated in liberal market economies (LMEs) but less so in coordinated market economies (CMEs), whereas strategic CSR, which requires a long-term horizon and substantial resource investments, is considered legitimate in CMEs but less so in LMEs. We theorize that narcissistic CEOs will try to pursue excellence (among their peers) in CSR activities that align with the norms and expectations in their institutional context in order to gain praise and avoid disapproval from their audiences and to bolster their moral superiority. Hence, we expect that the institutional context will moderate the relationship between CEO narcissism and CSR behavior such that in LMEs narcissistic CEOs will engage more in philanthropy than their peers but not in strategic CSR, whereas in CMEs they will invest more in strategic CSR but not in philanthropy. We test our predictions using panel data (2002-2023) from 148 large firms and 493 CEOs operating in 18 countries. Our pattern of findings supports our theory. By developing and testing a theoretical mechanism that connects macro-level institutional context with micro-level firm and CEO behavior, we contribute to both strategic leadership and CSR literature.</content>

    <title>Compromise Leadership: Competing Board Subgroups and the Appointment of a Newcomer Chair</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research suggests that firm-specific human capital is important in enabling board chairs to effectively lead their boards in their oversight duties. Despite this, some boards appoint newcomer directors to the chair position. This paper seeks to explain why. Building on power circulation and faultline theories, we posit that boards characterized by strongly divided subgroups with none dominant over the board may have difficulty in agreeing on promoting a director from among their ranks to the chair position, and instead select a board newcomer as a compromise solution. We further argue that this will be moderated by factors that affect either the power dynamics or the degree of contestation on the board. Analyses on a sample of 2,199 board chair appointments at S&amp;P 1500 firms between the years 2001 and 2017 support our hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Gender wage discrimination and the attractiveness of foreign MNC subsidiaries as employers for women</title>
    <updated>2025-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender wage discrimination is a grand challenge that constrains economic growth worldwide and denies women fair opportunities. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how women’s own experiences of wage discrimination steer their career decisions. We adopt the perspective of job-seeking women and argue that prior exposure to wage discrimination reshapes their employer preferences. Specifically, it can flip the liability of foreignness typically faced by foreign MNCs into a perceived employer advantage because foreign MNCs can deviate from the host country’s gender-biased norms. We study this mechanism for 165,624 female professionals and managers who changed jobs in Denmark between 2002 and 2015, using a pay transparency law from 2006 for identifying the underlying mechanism. We find that women who have suffered larger wage discrimination in domestic employment are more likely to start working for foreign MNC subsidiaries. This effect is weaker in labor markets in which high-performing domestic employers can offer other benefits, such as reputation or job security. The effect is stronger when foreign MNC subsidiaries signal gender fairness through a higher share of women in management. Overall, our findings show how wage discrimination redirects female career paths, transforming a grand challenge into a strategic advantage for foreign MNCs.</content>

    <title>Third-country MNEs, trade wars, and competitive opportunities: a real-options perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While geopolitical conflicts, including trade wars, have garnered substantial scholarly attention in recent years, the impact on the outsider firms not directly involved in such conflicts remains underexplored. Engaging in real-options informed analysis, we examine how MNEs from third countries may respond to trade wars by capitalizing on the potential for competitive opportunities: where trade wars prompt the scaling up of third-country subsidiary operations in the involved countries. We further explore how the strategic responses of third-country MNEs to the opportunities presented by a trade war can be enhanced by the strategic flexibility manifest in parent-MNE multinationality, the resources and networks embedded in local partners, and the presence of bilateral economic agreements. Employing the 2018 US–China trade war as an empirical context, our panel data encompass 3601 Chinese subsidiary operations for outsider MNEs hailing from 51 countries, which yields 14,404 annual subsidiary-level observations to conduct difference-in-differences analysis. The empirical results indicate that third-country MNEs disproportionately expanded their Chinese operations in response to the US–China tariff conflict, and that these strategic responses were pronounced for subsidiaries with highly multinational parents, local partnerships in the involved country, and a home–host country bilateral agreement.</content>

    <title>Can Crowdchecking Curb Misinformation? Evidence from Community Notes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, whereas traditional countermeasures struggle to balance effectiveness, scalability, and free expression. Many platforms are now experimenting with crowdsourced fact-checking—systems that rely on users’ collective judgment to identify and annotate misleading content. This paper investigates the efficacy of such systems in curbing misinformation in the context of Community Notes, a pioneering crowdsourced fact-checking system from Twitter/X. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that publicly displaying community notes significantly increases and accelerates the voluntary retraction of misleading tweets, demonstrating the viability of crowd-based fact-checking as an alternative to professional fact-checking and forcible content removal. The effect is primarily driven by authors’ reputational concerns and social pressure when corrections are visible to the public. Our findings carry meaningful implications for practice and policy. Individuals can play an active role by contributing to crowdchecking, strengthening collective information integrity. Platforms should adopt transparent, community-based systems, like Community Notes, as scalable, less controversial alternatives to forcible content removal. Policymakers can support these initiatives through regulatory guidance that promotes transparency and accountability.</content>

    <title>The role of identity in corporate governance: evidence from gender differences in the audit committee chair-chief financial officer dyad</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of identity in corporate governance, focusing on an important dyad: audit committee chair and chief financial officer. Drawing on identity theory, which argues that people have lower trust in those they perceive to be different from themselves, we posit that the audit committee chair’s trust in the chief financial officer is lower when the two are different genders. We find that a gender difference between the two is associated with greater monitoring by the chair, consistent with lower trust. This effect is attenuated when a firm has value-based controls that promote diversity tolerance or when a chief financial officer seems more trustworthy. We find no evidence that the increased monitoring improves financial reporting. However, we find evidence that the increased monitoring generates negative externalities by distracting the chief financial officer, as proxied by lower operational performance. Our findings underscore the importance of identity in corporate governance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies’ strategic alternatives announcements lead to negative future stock returns. First, we investigate whether this anomaly exists. We demonstrate that it is significant and pervasive across years, industries, firm size, and information environments and that it is not driven by confounding variables nor risk. We then investigate why the market misprices the announcements and find that investors appear overly optimistic about a potential merger or acquisition and do not fully incorporate the negative fundamental news conveyed by the announcement. Meanwhile, short sellers exploit the mispricing. We also evaluate market frictions as limits to arbitrage. This study’s contributions are (i) evaluating behavioral and risk explanations for an event that causes extreme stock returns, (ii) challenging investors’ widely held belief that such announcements reflect good news, and (iii) warning investors and analysts about a behavioral bias they might unknowingly adopt.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Process Flexibility Analysis for Production Systems with Differentiated Margins under Supply Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To mitigate supply and demand uncertainties, firms often design highly flexible production networks. This study investigates process flexibility in production systems subject to supply disruptions and stochastic demands with differentiated profit margins. In particular, we model supply disruptions as failures of arcs in the network, with node-based disruptions treated as a special case in which all arcs connected to a node simultaneously fail. To address the cost implications of such disruptions, we investigate the design of process flexibility under a robust optimization framework. We first develop a greedy algorithm under deterministic demand to efficiently evaluate the worst-case disruption scenario, and demonstrate the significant advantage of the alternate long-chain design under such disruptions. Subsequently, under stochastic demand, by introducing themarginal profit group index under disruption(MPGID), we characterize the worst-case total profit as a function of both the flexibility design and demand uncertainty, modeled through a partwise independently symmetric perturbation set. This representation enables direct performance comparisons across different flexibility configurations under disruption risk. For the case involving two products with distinct profit margins under supply disruption risk, we demonstrate that the alternate long-chain design outperforms all other long-chain configurations in terms of worst-case profitability. In addition, in certain cases, arc-based disruptions can be just as devastating as plant-node disruptions, particularly when they lead to the loss of high-margin demand. However, our fragility analysis reveals that this design becomes increasingly vulnerable as disruption risks intensify. To address this issue, we propose an MPGID-based heuristic that systematically generates flexible designs to mitigate both supply and demand uncertainties.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ spending decisions are shaped not only by their objective financial resources but also by their subjective perceptions of wealth. This research investigates the interplay between subjective poverty (e.g., feeling financially constrained) and income in driving spending. Across five studies including real-world spending data from a U.K. financial management app, longitudinal surveys from Kenya and the United States, and controlled experiments, the authors reveal that subjective poverty increases spending among higher-income consumers but decreases spending among lower-income consumers. That is, wealthy consumers who feel financially poor tend to spend more, whereas poorer consumers who feel financially constrained tend to reduce their spending. Drawing on compensatory control theory, the authors demonstrate that subjective poverty threatens individuals’ sense of personal control over life, but people cope with this diminished sense of control differently based on their available resources. Higher-income individuals engage in compensatory consumption to restore control, while lower-income individuals adopt different strategies, including reduced spending. This research advances the understanding of how psychological and material dimensions of wealth interact to shape consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The unique characteristics of the health care industry have given rise to an intriguing and pervasive form of joint venture between hospitals and physicians known as Physician–Hospital Organization (PHO). With transaction cost analysis as the overarching theory, the authors draw on practitioner insights and literature to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of PHOs and identify the boundary conditions under which PHOs are more likely to enhance patient satisfaction. They test the proposed model using multiyear panel data from 19,134 observations in the U.S. health care industry. The results underscore PHOs’ capability to enhance patient satisfaction with hospital services. The significant main effect grows stronger when the market is characterized by intense competition among hospitals, high mortality rates, urban settings, and high unemployment rates. The post hoc analysis reveals that PHOs can additionally improve patient recommendation of a hospital indirectly through patient satisfaction. This study contributes to research on governance structure and customer satisfaction by establishing a connection between PHO and patient satisfaction and identifying its boundary conditions. The findings highlight several fertile avenues for research.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent expansion in the availability of longitudinal and granular panel data has led to a significant increase in the adoption of dynamic panel data (DPD) models in empirical Operations Management (OM) research. To explore this trend, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of empirical OM studies published from 2012 to 2024 in four leading OM journals. Our findings reveal a marked rise in the utilization of DPD models in recent years, with 49 out of 66 (74.2%) reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024. Despite this growing adoption, the estimation of DPD models presents notable methodological challenges compared to standard panel fixed‐effects models, creating barriers to their wider use in empirical OM research. Our simulation shows that the widely used least‐squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator can be significantly biased when estimating DPD models. Variations in methodological choices can lead to differing results and conclusions, raising concerns about the rigor of current practices. To address these issues, we provide a technical review of recent estimation methods for DPD models, highlighting their underlying assumptions and initial conditions. Among these, we recommend the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for its flexibility and less restrictive assumptions, which have contributed to its popularity across various research fields. However, the application of GMM requires a careful, iterative process, which many OM researchers may not be familiar with. To support the effective use of GMM in DPD models in empirical OM research, we propose a practical framework that guides researchers through this process and demonstrates its practical use through real‐world data from supply base management. This framework aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy of estimating DPD models, facilitating more robust empirical research in the field of OM.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contextual advertising involves matching features of ads to features of the media context where they appear. We propose AdGazer, a new machine learning procedure to support contextual advertising. It comprises a theoretical framework organizing highand low-level features of ads and contexts, feature engineering models grounded in this framework, an XGBoost model predicting ad and brand attention, and an algorithm optimally assigning ads to contexts. AdGazer includes a Multimodal Large Language Model to extract high-level topics predicting the ad-context match. Our research uses a unique eye-tracking database containing 3531 digital display ads and their contexts, and aggregate ad and brand gaze times. We compare AdGazer’s predictive performance to two feature learning models, VGG16 and ResNet50. AdGazer predicts highly accurately with hold-out correlations of 0.83 for ad gaze and 0.80 for brand gaze, outperforming both feature learning models and generalizing better to out-of-distribution ads. Context features jointly contributed at least 33% to predicted ad gaze and about 20% to predicted brand gaze, good news for managers practicing or considering contextual advertising. We demonstrate that the theory-informed AdGazer effectively matches ads to advertising vehicles and their contexts, optimizing ad gaze more than current practice and alternatives like text-based and native contextual advertising.</content>

    <title>From kurtas to crop tops: A theory of postliminal self‐transformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research theorizespostliminal self‐transformation, the process by which consumers adapt to new status positions following major life transitions. Prior consumer research emphasizes liminality—the “betwixt and between” ambiguous phase— but overlooks what happens after liminality as individuals attempt to fit in. Drawing on qualitative data regarding young Indian women migrants to metropolitan corporate contexts, we reveal that transformation does not end with liminality but unfolds through a reflexive and effortful postliminal process. Women strategically use consumption—particularly of clothing and accessories—to bridge self‐discrepancies, mitigate exclusion, and gradually internalize their new professional identities. This stagewise progression moves from observation and mimicry to embodied transformation and identity mastery, often under constraints of patriarchy, class, and gender expectations. Contrasting with traditional (Western) models of adulthood that emphasize settling down, the women's postliminal adaptation is emancipatory and nonlinear, updating scripts for marking adulthood. By theorizing this postliminal adaptation, we challenge assumptions of instantaneous reincorporation, extending understanding of identity work. Our framework advances consumer psychology by showing how consumption facilitates ongoing self‐reconstruction in dynamic and inequitable social hierarchies.</content>

    <title>Reporting Regulation and Private Firms' Bank Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effect of reporting regulation on private firms' bank credit and its economic consequences. I exploit the Spanish institutional setting, which provides a unique combination of confidential loan data and regulatory features that generate quasi‐exogenous variation in reporting regulation. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that firms subject to incremental reporting regulation obtain more bank credit primarily through cash flow–based lending, term loans, and long‐term debt, without higher interest rates. These findings are explained by stronger banking competition and greater reliance on financial statement data. However, firms do not expand their net financial position, as bank credit substitutes for other liabilities, and exhibit weaker performance consistent with the costs of reporting regulation. This evidence from a different setting offers new insights into how reporting regulation influences credit contracting for private firms and strengthens the empirical basis for policy‐making.</content>

    <title>From critique to catalyst: How academic entrepreneurs transform negative feedback into pivots and performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how academic entrepreneurs refine business ideas in response to external critique and how these responses relate to performance. We develop a framework that links feedback (critique), business‐idea changes (pivots), and performance, and test it using detailed data on external stakeholder feedback, changes to the business idea's core and periphery, and commercialization outcomes in 316 academic‐led teams. We find that academic entrepreneurs frequently modify their business idea's core in response to negative feedback, and that core changes—rather than peripheral ones—are positively associated with commercialization. Challenging the idea that all entrepreneurs are inertial, we find that academic entrepreneurs both actively embrace and benefit from changes to the business idea's core. By tracing the feedback‐response dynamics of business idea components, our study adds granularity to research on pivoting.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face a choice between reworking the core of a business idea and making changes to its periphery. Analyzing 316 academic‐led teams seeking to commercialize technologies using the Lean Startup Method, we find that academic‐led teams frequently change their idea's core in response to negative feedback—and that only core changes, rather than peripheral changes, are linked to improved commercialization outcomes. Overall, the results show the effectiveness of the Lean Startup Method and demonstrate that focusing feedback on the core of the business idea is an effective way to provide feedback to academic entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The difference between corporate bond yields at issuance and in secondary markets, the “issuance premium,” spikes in bad times, raising firms’ capital costs. Using new bond-level data and high-frequency variation in bond supply and demand, I estimate a model of primary markets with imperfectly elastic investors, endogenous bond supply, and underwriter frictions that quantifies drivers of issuance premiums. I find underwriters’ favoritism toward investors increases issuance premiums’ levels and cyclical variation. On the other hand, relatively elastic investors allow primary markets to absorb large bond issuances. My findings inform policies targeted at bond issuance markets. (JEL G23, E44, G32, E52)</content>

    <title>Balancing Power in Decentralized Governance: Quadratic Voting and Information Aggregation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In decentralized governance, quadratic voting (QV)—where the cost of acquiring voting power is convex—optimally aggregates voter preferences, outperforming simpler linear voting (LV) mechanisms when voters have complete information. But what if they do not? We show that uncertainty not only breaks QV optimality but can also cause it to underperform LV. Intuitively, this is because cost convexity can disincentivize better-informed voters from adequately conveying their private information. The optimal mechanism varies with the distribution of stakes and information among voters, implying that QV’s known advantages in preference aggregation do not readily extend to common-value information aggregation settings.This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on the Digital Finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08469 .</content>

    <title>Deep Neural Newsvendor</title>

      <name>Jinhui Han, Ming Hu, Guohao Shen</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a data-driven newsvendor problem, where one has access to past demand data and the associated feature information. We solve the problem by estimating the target conditional quantile function using a deep neural network (DNN). The remarkable representational power of DNNs allows our framework to incorporate or approximate various extant data-driven models. We provide theoretical guarantees in terms of excess risk bounds for the DNN solution characterized by the network structure and sample size in a nonasymptotic manner, which justify the applicability of DNNs in relevant contexts. Specifically, the convergence rate of the excess risk bound with respect to the sample size increases in the smoothness of the target quantile function but decreases in the dimension of feature variables. This rate can be further accelerated when the target function possesses a composite structure. In particular, our theoretical framework can be extended to accommodate data-dependent scenarios, where the data-generating process could be time-dependent but not necessarily identical over time. Building on our theoretical results, we provide further managerial insights and practical guidance through simulation studies. Finally, we apply the DNN method to a real-world data set obtained from a food supermarket. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that (1) the DNN method consistently outperforms alternatives across a wide range of cost parameters, and (2) it exhibits good performance when the sample size is either very large or relatively limited.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2021-04295]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Project: Data-Driven Operations Analytics Methods]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Peking University; the General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grant 15305523]; and the Research Fund of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [Grant P0048718].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03157 .</content>

    <title>Social Media Sponsorship: Metrics and Strategies for Finding the Right Content Creator-Sponsor Matches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media video sponsorship, where sponsors partner with content creators to promote their brands, has become increasingly popular. Leveraging rich data on sponsored and nonsponsored videos on Facebook, we introduce two metrics, Content Similarity and Audience Closeness, to help sponsors find effective creator-sponsor matches. Content Similarity captures the thematic alignment between a creator’s content and a sponsor’s brand, whereas Audience Closeness measures how closely aligned a creator’s and sponsor’s audiences are within a social media network. We find that both metrics significantly increase video viewership, but their effects vary over time. Audience Closeness generates more immediate, short-term engagement, whereas Content Similarity drives sustained, long-term engagement. We additionally examine how congruency metrics can complement other sponsorship strategies, including partnering with more established creators, forming new partnerships, and managing the sponsor’s visibility within content. Our findings suggest that Content Similarity can mitigate the negative effects of frequent sponsor appearances and enhance viewer engagement, even in repetitive partnerships. Moreover, we find that Audience Closeness is particularly beneficial for larger, more established creators, whereas Content Similarity is less sensitive to the size of a creator’s following. Finally, we demonstrate how intermediary platforms can adopt these metrics to reduce information asymmetry and improve creator-sponsor matching, especially for long-tail creators and smaller brands.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01192 .</content>

    <title>Systematic Mispricing of Speculative Stocks and the Cross-Sectional Risk-Return Trade-off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the cross-section of returns from the perspective of a benchmark model that only includes systematic mispricing factors. In contrast to conclusions from standard benchmark models, we recover robust positive risk-return relations for many cross-sectional risk, distress, and friction proxies. Our findings are consistent with systematic mispricing that primarily affects speculative stocks and predominantly results in overpricing, predicting lower returns. Hence, failing to control for exposure to systematic mispricing can bias tests of risk-return trade-offs for anomalies with one speculative leg (e.g., risky, distressed, or high-friction stocks) and one nonspeculative leg. Overall, our study offers novel economic insight for this subset of anomalies, indicating that a positive risk-return trade-off can be resurrected after purging out the systematic mispricing component. The evidence suggests that a small shift in perspective generates a substantially different interpretation of the same data.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08815 .</content>

    <title>Embracing a Multipolar World: Management and Organization Scholars and Varieties of Socialism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the evolution to a multipolar economic world during the past three decades, management and organization scholars around the world still largely employ a capitalist view from the United States as the normal state, with scholars analysing other economic contexts as some variation of such capitalism. Despite the fact that over 43 percent of the world’s population lives in nations whose constitutions say the nation is socialist, management and organization scholars appear frozen in time, tied to a historical period when there was largely only one dominant economic model. OurPointis that when communities (nations or individual groups) pursue other economic forms, scholars need to consider that contextual setting, including the socialism, rather than simply assume a typical United States capitalist context as the foundation for research. We identify, define, and illustrate four varieties of socialism in thisPoint. In turn, we then demonstrate how scholars’ understanding of the specific domain of entrepreneurship can be enriched if the socialism of the given context is addressed rather than capitalism assumed. Management and organization scholarship around the world should, moving forward, reflect the dynamics of each unique context, including the respective economic system in that given context, rather than continue to reinforce a United States epistemological hegemony.</content>

    <title>Neurodiversity at Work: Challenges and Opportunities for Human Resource Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Neurodiversity—an umbrella term encompassing a range of neurocognitive developmental conditions such as autism‐spectrum conditions, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, and Tourette syndrome)—recognizes neurological differences as natural variations of the human brain. As management scholars increasingly explore this dimension of diversity, both researchers and practitioners are gaining a deeper understanding of the valuable contributions neurodivergent human capital can bring to the modern workplace. In this article, which serves as a primer for the special issue on neurodiversity and human resource management (HRM), we present a systematic review of the neurodiversity literature organized by employee lifecycle stage. The review synthesizes the most comprehensive practices at the intersection of neurodiversity and HRM. We then introduce the 13 articles featured in the special issue by positioning them within broader trends that emerged from our review. Moreover, we show how each article advances scholarship and practice in neurodiversity and HRM. We conclude by drawing on insights from both the review and the special issue contributions to offer recommendations for future research and practice that center on fostering more inclusive and effective HRM systems for neurodivergent individuals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of large‐rocket providers' support for small‐satellite manufacturers before the emergence of small rockets, we examine how disruptors to an incumbent ecosystem gain support from complementors of the incumbent technology. Our analyses illuminate the incumbent complementors' adjustment costs arising from cospecialization with specific incumbent technology designs and resource dependency on major incumbent technology customers. These adjustment costs disincentivize incumbent complementors from supporting the disruptors. In addition, we demonstrate that strategies adopted by the disruptors, such as technological standardization and forward integration, help mitigate these adjustment costs and incentivize incumbent complementors to support the disruptive innovation.Managerial SummarySmall satellites represent a disruptive innovation that significantly reduces the time and cost of satellite production and launch. Despite the large number of small satellites launched today, initially, they were viewed as “second‐class launch citizens,” with incumbent large‐rocket companies resisting launching them. This paper examines how small‐satellite manufacturers overcame this resistance before their dedicated small‐satellite ecosystem was established. We identify the adjustment costs that caused resistance from large‐rocket companies and examine two specific strategies implemented by disruptors—technological standardization and forward integration—to mitigate these costs and gain support from large‐rocket companies.</content>

    <title>Performance feedback and change in R&amp;amp;D alliance portfolio breadth: The moderating role of economic conditions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how firm performance feedback and economic conditions (upturns and downturns) impact changes in the breadth of partner types within a firm's R&amp;D alliance portfolio (R&amp;D AP breadth). We theorize that economic conditions moderate firms' motivation to change R&amp;D AP breadth in response to social and historical performance‐aspiration discrepancies, and shape whether they respond more strongly to social or historical aspirations. Using cross‐industry data on Swiss firms (1999–2020), we find that firms performing below social aspiration are more likely to expand R&amp;D AP breadth during downturns but less likely to do so during upturns. Performance below historical aspiration shows no significant effect once economic conditions are considered.Managerial SummaryWe examine how firms adjust their range of business partners in response to past performance and economic conditions. Analyzing Swiss firms from 1999 to 2020, we find that firms strategically adjust the number of partnership types in response to economic climates. During tough economic times, firms tend to broaden their R&amp;D partnership types when they fall short of peer performance benchmarks. They tend not to do so in prosperous periods under similar performance conditions. We found no consistent effects when performance is benchmarked against the firm's history. These insights help managers strategically navigate alliances under fluctuating economic conditions and underscore the importance of peer‐relative performance benchmarks.</content>

    <title>Permanent Capital Losses After Banking Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the mechanisms driving bank losses across historical banking crises in 46 economies and the effectiveness of policy interventions in restoring bank capitalization. We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations. Early liquidity interventions can avert banking crises, but only under specific conditions. Once large bank equity declines have occurred, policy responses have historically failed to prevent persistent undercapitalization in the banking sector.</content>

    <title>Republican Support and Economic Hardship: The Enduring Effects Of the Opioid Epidemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we establish a causal connection between two of the most salient social developments in the United States over the past decades: the opioid epidemic and the political realignment between the Republican and Democratic parties. Drawing on unsealed records from litigation against Purdue Pharma, we uncover rich geographic variation in the marketing of prescription opioids that serves as a quasi-exogenous source of exposure to the epidemic. We use this variation to document significant increases in drug-related mortality and greater reliance on public transfer programs. This induced economic hardship led to substantial changes in the political landscape of the communities most affected by the opioid epidemic. We estimate that from the mid-2000s to 2022, exposure to the opioid epidemic continuously increased the Republican vote share in House, presidential, and gubernatorial elections. By the 2022 House elections, a one-standard-deviation increase in our measure of exposure led to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the Republican vote share. From 2012 until 2022, this increase in the House vote share translated into Republicans winning additional seats.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: PRODUCT RECALL CONTAGION in the SUPPLY CHAIN</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Following a manufacturer’s large product recall, its supplier’s shareholders may perceive uncertain future demand for the supplier’s products and react punitively, causing a drop in the supplier’s stock return—i.e., a contagion (or negative spillover). Moreover, shareholders’ information asymmetry may cause them to “screen” the supplier’s information cues to determine the supplier’s extent of demand uncertainty. The ideal screen is the supplier’s proportion of sales revenue from the recalling manufacturer. However, not all suppliers disclose this information. Therefore, we propose that shareholders use a two-stage screening. The first screen is whether the supplier demonstrates transparency by voluntarily disclosing information about its customer portfolio. The second screen—available only to the subset of suppliers that disclose customer information—is the supplier’s sales revenue from the recalling manufacturer. We used a sample of 896 U.S. public manufacturer-supplier dyads impacted by 27 large manufacturer recalls. An event study followed by cross-sectional regressions provides evidence of contagion. In addition, it reveals that the supplier’s voluntary disclosure of customer information mitigates contagion, whereas revenue dependence aggravates it. Contextual (i.e., recall) variables also impact contagion. Our research study contributes to the supply-chain contagion literature, screening theory, and customer information disclosure literature. The findings inform supplier firm managers that their prior customer-related disclosures and the contextual variables can moderate contagion.</content>

    <title>Adaptive Learning in Uncertain and Sequential Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In competitive markets, companies often lack access to their rivals’ sales, costs, and strategies. Can they still learn to make optimal decisions? In a new study, Li and Mehrotra show that the answer is yes. Their research demonstrates that even without competitor data, firms can adaptively learn to make near-optimal choices using only their own operational information. More strikingly, when all players follow such self-driven learning, the entire market converges to a Nash equilibrium—the stable state predicted by economic theory—without explicit coordination. The study establishes theoretical guarantees for both convergence rates and regret performance and illustrates the framework in inventory management and dynamic pricing settings. These findings provide a foundation for data-driven decision making in competitive and uncertain environments and offer insights into how markets naturally self-organize.</content>

    <title>On Generalization and Regularization via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has gained prominence in operations research and machine learning as a powerful method for achieving solutions with favorable out-of-sample performance. Two compelling explanations for its success are the generalization bounds derived from Wasserstein DRO and its equivalence to regularization schemes commonly used in machine learning. However, existing results on generalization bounds and regularization equivalence are largely limited to settings where the Wasserstein ball is of a specific type, and the decision criterion takes certain forms of expected functions. In this paper, we show that generalization bounds and regularization equivalence can be obtained in a significantly broader setting, where the Wasserstein ball is of a general type and the decision criterion accommodates any form, including general risk measures. This not only addresses important machine learning and operations management applications but also expands to general decision-theoretical frameworks previously unaddressed by Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a by-product, we show that Wasserstein DRO coincides with the recent max-sliced Wasserstein DRO for any decision criterion under affine decision rules, resulting in both being efficiently solvable as convex programs via our general regularization results. These general assurances provide a strong foundation for expanding the application of Wasserstein DRO across diverse domains of data-driven decision problems.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12371476 and 71921001] and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2023-05829].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03895 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Do Purchase Preconditions Increase Purchase Intention? The Role of External Reference Points</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently advertise price promotions with purchase preconditions (i.e., minimum spending). This research provides a novel perspective for evaluating preconditions: treating them as external reference points (ERPs) that override consumers’ internal reference points (IRPs) and thus alter perceived discount magnitude. Specifically, consumers evaluate a discount without a precondition by comparing it with an IRP based on past experiences. Conversely, a discount with a precondition creates a new, salient benchmark (ERP) against which the discount is more likely to be evaluated. Due to this change in reference point, a precondition resets the consumer’s discount magnitude calculus, influencing their intentions to shop at the store. This can create dominance violations in which restricted discounts are preferred to their unrestricted counterparts, contingent on whether the precondition is below or above the IRP. The influence of a precondition as an ERP on discount magnitude perceptions is attenuated when the IRP is highly accessible in memory, or when the discount magnitude is already explicit in relative (e.g., percentage) terms. Additionally, similar effects can be produced with a product category restriction equivalent in value to the precondition, and the effect of adding a precondition is attenuated when the equivalent value reference is already present.</content>

    <title>Middle Managers’ Regulation of the Emotions of Others in Strategy Implementation: A Process Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article develops a process model of how middle managers regulate the negative emotions of their team members to support strategy implementation. Based on a 9‐month ethnographic study in a public broadcasting company, we examine how managers navigate emotionally charged resistance to top‐down strategic themes during meetings. While prior research emphasizes individual techniques, we show that emotion regulation of others (ERO) unfolds as a sequenced process involving three interconnected phases: understanding emotional status, interpersonal tuning, and encouraging reappraisal. Our findings highlight that emotional influence is not achieved through isolated tactics, but through temporally coordinated and relationally attuned practices. In doing so, the study reconciles the tension between validating negative emotions and enabling emotional change. It advances research on middle managers by theorizing how they navigate emotional resistance in real time and contributes to ERO theory by demonstrating the importance of temporal coordination between validation and reappraisal.</content>

    <title>Why is Bribing Doctors an Excusable Crime? The Normalization of Professional Corruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professional corruption is a pervasive issue with significant societal consequences. This study investigates the normalization of professional corruption by examining bribery among physicians in Chinese hospitals, where informal payments, or ‘red packets’, from patients were often reported despite being illegal. Drawing on a qualitative case study, we develop a process model comprising four mutually reinforcing building blocks: organizational arrangements, which capture distinct features of professional campuses that enable corruption; constrained supervision, which weakens institutional governance and limits accountability to clients; rationalizations, through which professionals justify informal payments by emphasizing professional expertise and social respect while downplaying the social trusteeship value; and socialization, which operates through a combination of structural assurance and backstage cocoons that desensitize professionals to the ethical implications of bribery. Furthermore, we highlight the role of cultural resonance in linking corrupt practices to traditional gift‐giving customs, thereby legitimating informal payments in professional contexts. Our findings contribute to understanding how organizational factors and cultural traditions jointly enable corruption, offering insights applicable to other professional organizations while emphasizing important boundary conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how firms attempt to preempt activism before it mobilizes into an active threat. Employing a difference‐in‐differences design, we examine the quasi‐exogenous enactments of laws that prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti‐SLAPP laws) in the United States. We find evidence suggesting that in response to the enactment of anti‐SLAPP laws, firms self‐regulate through enhancing their institutional corporate social performance (institutional CSP). This response is more pronounced in firms with greater firm‐specific activism risk, as evidenced by greater media coverage on firms' social irresponsibility. These findings suggest that, in response to activism risk, firms attempt to keep activists from targeting them by preemptively engaging in self‐regulatory improvement in their institutional CSP. The preemptive action we document extends research on stakeholder activism.Managerial SummaryBy analyzing how US firms respond to the enactment of laws that prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti‐SLAPP laws), we find that in anticipation of activist attacks, firms enhance their institutional corporate social performance (institutional CSP). This proactive response is more evident in firms facing a heightened risk of activism, such as those with substantial media exposure for socially irresponsible outcomes. We suggest the looming institutional risk of activism prompts firms to engage in self‐regulatory adaptation in enhancing their institutional CSP, hopefully mitigating the risk of being targeted by stakeholder activists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Planogram Design and Display Fees on Retail Category Management</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of planogram design (i.e., placement of products on shelves) and display fees (i.e., fees manufacturers pay retailers for prime shelf space) on a retailer’s category management strategy and interactions with national brand manufacturers (NBMs). We consider a game-theoretic model with one retailer and multiple NBMs. Each NBM offers one product. In addition, the retailer has the option to introduce a store brand (SB) product. If the retailer decides to introduce its SB, it needs to drop one of the national brand (NB) products from its assortment because it has limited shelf space. The retailer’s planogram has one prime shelf space and multiple nonprime shelf spaces. The prime shelf space has a demand-stimulating impact. The NBMs determine their wholesale prices and how much they are willing to pay for the prime shelf space. The retailer makes SB introduction and planogram decisions. It also sets the quantities for each product in its assortment, resulting in market-clearing retail prices. Our analysis leads to three key findings: First, the presence of a prime shelf space may not only prevent the retailer from introducing its SB but also lead to sizable changes in the retail and wholesale prices in the category. For example, an extensive numerical study reveals that receiving the prime shelf space increases an NB product’s retail price by 5.48%. The average increase in the same product’s wholesale price is 2.52%, as the prospect of charging a higher wholesale price incentivizes its manufacturer to pay a display fee for securing the prime shelf space. Second, there are cases in which the retailer uses SB introduction as a strategic lever to intensify the competition for the prime shelf space and thereby increase its revenue from display fees. Third, despite being an additional expense, display fees can increase the NBMs’ profits by allowing them to influence the retailer’s assortment and planogram decisions in their favor. We discuss the implications of these findings for managers and researchers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Generative AI Announcements on Suppliers: Evidence from the Stock Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) technology is revolutionizing firm operations and supply chain management, profoundly influencing firms within the GenAI supply chain network. While a few emerging studies have explored the impact of GenAI initiatives on firms’ stock performance, it remains unclear how such disruptive technology initiatives affect the stock price movements of their supply chain partners. This paper empirically investigates the impact of firms’ GenAI initiatives on the abnormal stock returns of their suppliers by analyzing data on news, supply chain relationships, and daily stock prices. The analysis indicates that, on average, a firm’s GenAI announcement leads to a positive abnormal return of 0.27% for its suppliers on the announcement day, with additional evidence of sustained long-term value creation. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that this spillover effect is more pronounced among suppliers with higher R&amp;D intensity, stronger sales growth, closer geographic proximity to the focal firm, and operations in less competitive industries. Furthermore, the positive abnormal returns are significantly greater when the GenAI initiative pertains to product innovation rather than process improvement. Our findings have important implications for supply chain stakeholders navigating the adoption of GenAI technologies.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Surgeon Daily Workload and Its Implications for Operating Room Scheduling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many service systems, an individual server’s workload can have a substantial impact on service time and quality. Such effects are particularly important in healthcare systems which often operate under resource and time constraints. In much of the literature, this effect of workload has been primarily considered at the system and instantaneous level rather than the individual and cumulative level. In this study, we investigate this relationship in the context of cardiac surgery, i.e., how surgery duration and patient outcomes are affected by the individual surgeon’s daily workload. Using a detailed data set of more than 5,600 cardiac operations in a large hospital, we quantify how individual surgeon daily workload (the number of operations performed by the focal surgeon) affects surgery duration and patient outcomes. To handle the endogeneity of surgeon daily workload, we construct instrumental variables using operational factors of the cardiac surgery department, including the regular surgery schedule of surgeons. We find that high daily workload for the focal surgeon is associated with longer surgery duration as well as post-surgery length-of-stay in the ICU and hospital. These results highlight the potential negative impact of high individual surgeon workload. We develop a surgical scheduling model that incorporates the estimated impact of surgeon daily workload. We solve the model by mixed-integer quadratic programming and show that our proposed schedule can substantially reduce total OR time and post-surgery length-of-stay. Our results suggest that hospitals should take into account the effects of individual surgeon daily workload when managing their ORs. Specifically, they can substantially improve patient flow and patient outcomes by smoothing individual surgeon’s workload across days.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, earnings call slide decks (hereafter, earnings decks) have become increasingly common in the earnings announcements of public firms. In this paper, I examine the characteristics of earnings decks and the determinants of firms’ use of them. More importantly, I study their capital market roles. While I fail to find evidence that earnings decks on average offer information incremental to traditional disclosures, such as press releases and conference calls, they significantly reduce users’ information processing time. My analyses reveal three mechanisms that contribute to this acceleration: inclusion of visuals (e.g., charts and tables), summarization of key information, and release prior to earnings calls. Overall, this study documents a novel aspect of earnings announcements and highlights the role of multimedia elements in reducing information processing costs of corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72402110, 72442014].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04956 .</content>

    <title>A Framework for Selecting Action Portfolios with Incomplete and Action-Dependent Scenario Probabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies pursue their goals by selecting and implementing a combination or portfolio of actions that consume resources. The extent to which these actions help attain the companies’ objectives is often contingent on whether a given future scenario is realized. In this paper, we present a model-based framework for supporting the selection of a portfolio of actions that is robust across different scenarios while accounting for the impacts that the actions may have on the probabilities of these scenarios. For the purposes of this framework, we develop a new portfolio decision analytic model and algorithms to help generate recommendations for selecting actions, when (i) the actions’ scenario- and objective-specific impacts, as well as preferences between the objectives are incompletely specified, and (ii) information regarding scenario probabilities is incomplete and may depend on the selected actions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive report on the application of the framework in a high-impact case on supporting the strategy process at the payments unit of Nordea Bank Abp, the largest retail bank in the Nordic countries. Based on retrospective interviews with the participants in this strategy process, three kinds of impacts from the use of our framework could be identified: (i) actions related to implementing the decision recommendations and strengthening the required capabilities, (ii) information to help evaluate these decision recommendations as the future unfolded, and (iii) behavioral changes in terms of elevating the level of strategic discussions.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Liikesivistysrahasto [Grant 16-9442].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05383 .</content>

    <title>Deciphering the PCAOB Inspection Process: Evidence and Predictive Insights from Public Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Little is known about how the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) selects audits for inspections. We exploit public data that track PCAOB searches of issuer Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and the trial transcripts of United States of America v. David Middendorf to provide the first large-sample evidence on confidential PCAOB monitoring activities. We initially validate that PCAOB searches spike during actual inspections of triennially inspected auditors and for a list of KPMG audits inspected in 2016. Importantly, we find that PCAOB searches vary predictably with ongoing audit-flagged events, client corporate events, and client characteristics, and these screening and inspection activities extend beyond enforcement actions. Using KPMG data, we introduce a PCAOB inspection prediction model for Big 4 clients based solely on public data, with predicted incidence closely aligning with actual inspections. One implication of our study is that, perhaps to mitigate political costs, the PCAOB relies overly on conspicuous trigger events that already signal low audit quality (i.e., restatements, auditor changes, chief financial officer turnovers, bankruptcies, and SEC comment letters), raising the question of how its risk-based inspection program is designed to improve overall audit quality or minimize large audit failures. In addition, although model-inferred PCAOB inspections are not associated with future restatements, broader PCAOB monitoring activities, as proxied by search intensity, exhibit modest predictive power. Overall, our study provides a more nuanced understanding of the PCAOB inspection program and the factors driving its revealed preferences.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University, Baruch College, and the Penn State Smeal College of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08084 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this crowdsourced initiative, 57 independent analysts used the same longitudinal dataset to address four major empirical questions in international business. For all four research questions, different analysts obtained substantial estimates in opposite directions, meaning that they could have drawn any conclusion at all had they conducted the project alone. Aggregating across the results obtained by different analysts pointed to an overall answer for two of the four research questions, although for one of the two questions, the evidence was more suggestive than conclusive. That said, the variability in results was not simply random, and could in some cases be meaningfully explained. Choices regarding how to operationalize variables played an important role in determining the empirical results, and expert analysts were more likely to report large positive effects. Rather than exhibiting a bias to confirm their pre-existing beliefs, analysts appeared to rationally update their beliefs considering the evidence. Overall, these findings empirically demonstrate the role of subjective researcher choices in shaping results in international business research yet also show that it is still possible to draw meaningful conclusions in science. We advocate for an open science of international business in which the consequences of subjective analytic choices are rendered as transparent as possible.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploiting changes in countries’ competition laws, we find that competition increases firms’ propensity to use zero leverage (ZL). We test the financial-flexibility, financial-constraint, and quiet-life explanations for this result, concluding that desire for flexibility is the one most likely. The relation between competition and ZL strengthens with cash-flow volatility, which supports the flexibility motive. Adoption of ZL by firms is accompanied by increases in payouts, so it is unlikely that ZL adopters are constrained. Proxies for governance have no effect on the relation between competition and ZL, suggesting that desire for a quiet life is not the explanation either.</content>

    <title>Conceptualizing Consumer Body Awareness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research typically treats body awareness as a subset of self-awareness, which emphasizes identity and appearance at the expense of embodied sensations. This article offers a corrective by reconceptualizing consumer body awareness as a distinct, cultivated capacity, defined as the ability to notice, make sense of, and respond to exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive sensations with the help of marketplace resources. Prior studies show that consumers are increasingly turning to the marketplace to find bodily reconnection and seek relief from the disembodied pull of digitalized, market-mediated life. Research also shows that while marketplace resources can help build body awareness, they can also distract from it. What the literature does not explain is how consumers engage with marketplace resources as their body awareness evolves. Building on an ethnographic inquiry into ultra-running, this article introduces a four-stage process of cultivating consumer body awareness: attuning, listening, connecting, and integrating. Findings show how marketplace resources both enable and obstruct body learning across these stages, ultimately recalibrating consumption choices and brand relationships.</content>

    <title>The Use and Usefulness of Attention Checks in Behavioral Research</title>
    <updated>2025-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Attention checks have been touted as a means of excluding inattentive and careless responses from survey data. As a result, numerous approaches have been proposed, but which are most helpful has received less interest. The present paper demonstrates this blind spot has obscured vast differences in attention check efficacy. An initial survey of consumer-behavior and decision-making researchers revealed six commonly used attention check approaches (memory checks, questions with obvious answers, English comprehension, self-reported attentiveness, straight-lining, and variations on the Instructional Manipulation Check). These were then paired with six effects, drawn from the Many Labs series of papers in social psychology (N &amp;gt; 22,000, all pre-registered). The different checks varied substantially at reducing noise and increasing effect size. Follow-up studies suggest that participant attentiveness, as currently measured, may reflect a given participant’s general approach to completing studies, rather than momentary fatigue or boredom varying across time or within studies. We recommend behavioral researchers focus their efforts on going beyond mere “pulse-checkers” and consider favoring the use of memory checks and obvious questions as attention checks in their research.</content>

    <title>Do Earnings Announcements Affect Employee Spending? Evidence from Transaction Data*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging micro‐level data on individual employees’ bank and credit card transactions, we examine the impact of earnings announcement (EA) news on employee spending. Utilizing an event study methodology, we find strong evidence that EA news elicits significant reactions in employee spending. These reactions are stronger for employees located in the firm's headquarters state, with longer tenure, possessing investment experience, or earning higher wages, consistent with these employees being more likely to attend to their firm's EAs. The reactions are also stronger for the fourth fiscal quarter than interim quarters, suggesting that year‐end results garner greater employee attention. Furthermore, consistent with media facilitating employee processing of EA news, the reactions are stronger for EAs covered by a larger number of news articles. Finally, in line with the notion that EAs contain information about employees’ future cash flows, we find that EA news predicts changes in employee wages and that employees with higher past wage‐to‐EA news sensitivity exhibit stronger spending reactions. Overall, our findings provide evidence of the role of financial reporting in employees’ spending decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To decide about retirement, employees assess and react to their work environment, including age‐inclusive HR practices. Age‐inclusive HR practices ensure equal access to key HR functions for all employees—regardless of age, for example, training and development for all age groups, unlike age‐specific HR practices, which target older workers exclusively, for example, development opportunities for older workers. In this study, we uncover why age‐inclusive HR practices are effective in retaining older employees. Using a conservation of resources theory approach, we explain that age‐inclusive HR practices can enhance older employees' employability (i.e., perceived ability to realize job opportunities within and between employers) and reduce their job insecurity (i.e., perceived risk of a decline in job quality, including working conditions, career prospects, and salary). Employability, conversely, weakens employees' retirement intentions, while job insecurity strengthens these intentions. We use a three‐wave design with 758 older employees and path analysis, controlling for age‐specific HR practices, to demonstrate the unique effect of age‐inclusive HR practices on employees' retirement intentions. Findings showed that age‐inclusive HR practices (beyond age‐specific HR practices) were indirectly linked to employees' retirement intentions via job insecurity but not employability, emphasizing their importance for resource loss prevention as a means for older employees' retention.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit a panel of city-level data with rich demographic information to estimate the distributional effects of Department of Defense spending and its effects on a range of social outcomes. The income and employment generated by defense spending accrue predominantly to households without a bachelor’s degree. These households as well as Black and Hispanic households tend to disproportionately benefit from this spending. Defense spending also promotes a range of beneficial social outcomes that are often targeted by government programs, including reductions in poverty, divorce rates, disability rates, and mortality rates, as well as increases in homeownership rates, health insurance rates, and occupational prestige. We compare the effects of defense spending with the effects of general demand shocks and explore reasons for the differential effects of the shocks.</content>

    <title>Demystifying the Black Box: Organizational Design and Contracting for Technology Partnerships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study moves beyond the traditional atomistic view of firms engaged in alliance agreements. By integrating current research on internal organizational design with research on interfirm collaboration, we investigate the implications of the organizational design of parent firms for the design and governance of technology partnerships. More specifically, we propose that in a research and development (R&amp;D) alliance between a client firm and an R&amp;D firm, the client firm’s internal organizational structure in R&amp;D plays an important role in alliance design and governance. Centralized firms are better able to integrate knowledge in the organization compared with decentralized firms, and hence, we theorize that they will design their technology partnerships for greater knowledge access. Empirical findings from alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry offer support for our predictions: firms with centralized R&amp;D decision making are more likely to capture intellectual property rights. Further, these firms tend to engage in alliances with broader vertical and horizontal scope and greater technological interdependence in order to access, recombine, and distribute knowledge. This study extends research on alliance design and governance by underscoring the important influence of a partner firm’s organizational structure.</content>

    <title>The Failure to Recognize Anti-Asian Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Anti-Asian discrimination remains prevalent in the United States but continues to be reported and charged at low levels. In the current research, we seek to understand this puzzle in the context of workplace discrimination. Integrating the literature on the U.S. racial status hierarchy—which positions Asian Americans as an intermediate status group situated in between White and Black Americans—with the prototype model of attributions to discrimination, we propose that lay observers do not consider Asian Americans to be prototypical targets of racial discrimination. As a result, we predict that observers are less likely to attribute potentially discriminatory incidents to discrimination when those incidents involve Asian (compared with Black) targets. We find evidence supporting our predictions across two studies assessing prototypes of targets of racial discrimination (Studies 1 and 2), three preregistered experiments comparing attributions to discrimination for Asian and Black job candidates (Studies 3–5), and a data set of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission discrimination charges (Study 6). Our research makes theoretical advances on the racial experience of Asian employees by identifying Asian Americans as nonprototypical targets of racism and underscoring the relative failure of attributions to discrimination as an insidious problem that likely perpetuates anti-Asian racism at work.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18628 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce partial law invariance, generalizing law invariance, and probabilistic sophistication widely used in decision theory, as well as statistical and financial applications. Partial law invariance may be interpreted as law invariance restricted to events for which there is no model uncertainty, reflecting practical situations in decision theory and financial risk management. We fully characterize partially law-invariant coherent risk measures via a novel representation formula. Strong partial law invariance is defined to bridge the gap between the above characterization and the classic representation formula of Kusuoka. We propose a few classes of new risk measures, including partially law-invariant versions of the expected shortfall and the entropic risk measures, and illustrate their applications in risk assessment under different types of uncertainty. We provide a tractable optimization formula for computing a class of partially law-invariant coherent risk measures and give a numerical example.This paper was accepted by Aurélien Baillon, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grants CRC-2022-00141, RGPIN-2020-04356, and RGPIN-2024-03728].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06518 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users are now typically able to access historical data in traffic, restaurant, and retailing contexts. This availability of information can be viewed as a means to reduce congestion. However, scientific support for this notion is weak. We investigate, using a laboratory experiment, whether an intermediate level of information provision might reduce congestion. We also study how the effect of making more information available changes over time. We show that providing all users with information is counterproductive in the short run. In the long run, users’ behavior adjusts so that providing some or all individuals with information leads to more efficient outcomes than when no information is made available. Small Sample models capture a number of the patterns in the data, in particular the switching behavior between routes. The data show that making congestion information available to all parties reduces efficiency early on but is beneficial in the long run.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the Economic Science Laboratory at the University of Arizona and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72403135] for funding.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00056 .</content>

    <title>Spillover Effects of Opioid Abuse on Skilled Human Capital and Innovation Activity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document effects of the opioid epidemic on the migration and output of skilled workers who drive corporate innovation. Exploiting geographic variation in opioid abuse unrelated to economic conditions and using both patent and home sales-based measures, we show that inventors and research labs exit affected areas. This displacement is accompanied by declines in the quantity and value of patents of approximately 7% and $10.6 million per year, respectively. Declines in school quality, safety, and other amenities drive the out-migration. Because displaced workers are unlikely to abuse opioids, our results represent spillover effects of opioid abuse on nonusers.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: The project received funding from the University of Kansas’s General Research Fund and Troesh Center Research Grants from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

    <title>Reclaiming Relevance Through Problem‐Driven Interdisciplinary Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management studies initially emerged as an applied field, uniquely positioned to tackle practical organizational problems through interdisciplinary research. Over time, however, the field has prioritized abstract theoretical contributions over real‐world engagement, fragmenting into disciplinary silos ill‐equipped to address complex contemporary management problems, such as climate change, technological disruptions, and social inequalities. Although this theoretical turn has deepened the rigor of the field, it has eroded the field’s distinct value and relevance. We call for management studies to reclaim its applied origins through interdisciplinary, problem‐driven research, which leverages the field’s unique integrative capacity while preserving theoretical depth. Drawing on Herbert Simon’s distinction between well‐ and ill‐structured problems, we propose a framework that matches problem types to appropriate forms of interdisciplinary engagement: coordination for moderately well‐structured issues, collaboration for moderately ill‐structured ones, and co‐creation for highly ill‐structured challenges. This framework offers a conceptual scaffold for scholars seeking to engage with pressing organizational and societal challenges while navigating the institutional and epistemic barriers to interdisciplinary research. By returning to its applied origins through problem‐driven, interdisciplinary research, management studies can restore both its scholarly legitimacy and societal relevance.</content>

    <title>Opportunity Search in the Era of GenAI: Navigating Uncertainty in an Expanding Universe of Imaginable but Unknowable Futures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship has often been viewed through a lens of scarcity of creativity. Yet, the arrival of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) forces us to appreciate that the bottleneck of entrepreneurship is not the lack of creative ideas but Knightian Uncertainty. In an era of abundant entrepreneurial ideas, what matters is whether AI‐generated entrepreneurial futures are possible or figments of machine imagination. However, extant theory offers little guidance on navigating opportunity uncertainty – let alone amid an ever‐expanding universe of AI‐generated ideas that increases the risk of unsustainable venturing. Addressing what we theorize as a “grand epistemological challenge”, we develop a model of intelligent opportunity search. The architecture of the model is informed by Gerd Gigerenzer’s paradigm shift in decision‐making under uncertainty, centred on the use of heuristics that match the structure of the environment. Our model advances a symbiotic division of epistemic labour between machine and human intelligence guided by decision strategies attuned to the structure of the decision environment as reshaped in the GenAI era. The gist of the model is that machine creativityexpandsthe ideation space through generative variation, while human judgmentcontractsit through a curation process geared towards the elimination of non‐opportunities. This structured opportunity detection process reflects a new ecology of entrepreneurial action, where successful opportunity search depends less on human creativity and imagination and more on eliminating what cannot be actualized. Besides advancing a novel perspective on the nature of human and machine symbiosis, this paper unpacks implications for opportunity theory and Knightian Uncertainty.</content>

    <title>Expert Memories: The Professional Construction of the Past and the Mnemonic Making of Occupations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article introduces the special issue on occupations and memory in organizations. To foster increasing collaboration from scholars from both fields, we offer a general argument connecting memory and occupations on two levels. At the societal level, we show how memory experts, such as historians, archivists, and museologists, have played a fundamental role in the development of modernity and the emergence of our contemporary historical consciousness. At the occupational level, we argue that occupations are transgenerational communities maintained through various practices and technologies of memory whose legitimacy and professional status increasingly depend on their ability to cultivate both practical and historical memory. We further explore three related topics covered by the papers from this special issue: expert and memory work, occupational and mnemonic communities, and professional and mnemonic projects. At the end, we identify three promising themes for future research: the negotiation of boundaries and resources among communities; the interaction between technology, expertise, and memory; and the occupational ethics and responsibility towards past actions and memories.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do cities grow in the process of structural transformation? To answer this question, we develop a multi-sector spatial equilibrium model with endogenous land use: land is used either for agriculture or housing. Urban land, densely populated due to commuting frictions, expands out of agricultural land. With low productivity and high subsistence needs, farmland is expensive, households cannot afford large homes and cities are very dense. Increasing productivity reallocates factors away from agriculture, freeing up land for urban expansion and limiting the increase in land values despite higher income and urban population. With the area of cities growing faster than urban population, urban density can persistently decline, as in the data over a long period. The quantitative evaluation calibrated to historical data assembled for France over 180 years explains a large fraction of the joint evolution of urban areas, population density and land values across time and space.</content>

    <title>Putting Climate into Context: How Culture and Composition Shape the Effects of Diversity Climate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing evidence demonstrates that an organization’s diversity climate can enhance its bottom line. Though some scholars theorize potential mediators to explain these effects, recent meta-analytic and literature reviews conclude that much remains unknown regarding both why diversity climate influences outcomes and how sociocultural factors within and beyond the organization may shape its implications. We propose that unit-level diversity climate stands to produce more uniformly positive affective commitment levels (i.e., higher commitment mean and lower commitment dispersion), thereby optimizing the returns on human capital investments in the form of greater unit productivity. Data from 738 stores in 48 American states indicate a significant indirect effect of unit diversity climate on productivity through affective commitment mean and dispersion. Moreover, we apply the concept of climate context congruence to extend diversity climate theory and explore the influence of alignment among unit-level diversity climate, unit composition (i.e., racioethnic diversity), and cultural tightness–looseness (i.e., state tightness–looseness) in the geographic region within which the unit is operating. In doing so, we offer a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of the sociocultural conditions wherein supportive diversity climates may be differentially beneficial. Our results support the notion that organizations may reap greater benefits of diversity climate when state culture and unit composition align (i.e., tighter/homogenous, or looser/diverse) to accentuate diversity climate efficacy.</content>

    <title>Post-trade Netting and Contagion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper analyses how post-trade netting in over-the-counter derivatives markets affects systemic risk. It defines the notion of a post-trade netting (PTN) exercise and shows that two post-trade netting services that rely on multilateral netting techniques, namely, portfolio rebalancing and portfolio compression, are special cases of a PTN exercise. It formally characterises the relationship between portfolio rebalancing and portfolio compression. The paper then analyses the effects of post-trade netting from a network perspective by considering contagion arising from defaults on variation margin payments. It provides sufficient conditions for post-trade netting to reduce systemic risk and shows that post-trade netting can be harmful. It also explores the implications of post-trade netting when institutions strategically react to liquidity stress by delaying their payments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding consumer preferences is crucial for designing better products, optimizing assortments, and personalizing recommendations. In “Active Learning for Nonparametric Choice Models,” Fransisca Susan, Negin Golrezaei, Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh, and David Kempe present an active learning approach that efficiently uncovers the most informative patterns in the choices made by members of a heterogeneous population. Instead of relying solely on historical transaction data, their method strategically selects sets of products to offer and then uses the responses to construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of preferences. This DAG captures the top k choices, their probabilities, and how they relate to each other as k changes. Experiments on synthetic and real‐world data show that the method learns preferences more accurately—and with fewer data points—than leading offline techniques. This work advances both the theory and practice of preference learning, with implications for retail, online platforms, and artificial intelligence agents that need to model human decision making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a multiclass queueing model of a telephone call center in which a system manager dynamically allocates available servers to customer calls. Calls can terminate through either service completion or customer abandonment, and the manager strives to minimize the expected total of holding costs plus abandonment costs over a finite horizon. Focusing on the Halfin–Whitt heavy traffic regime, we derive an approximating diffusion control problem and, building on earlier work by Beck et al. [Beck C, Becker S, Cheridito P, Jentzen A, Neufeld A (2021) Deep splitting method for parabolic PDEs. SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43(5):A3135–A3154], develop a simulation-based computational method for solution of such problems, one that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. Using this computational method, we propose a policy for the original (prelimit) call center scheduling problem. Finally, the performance of this policy is assessed using test problems based on publicly available call center data. For the test problems considered so far, our policy does as well as or better than the best benchmark we could find. Moreover, our method is computationally feasible at least up to dimension 500, that is, for call centers with 500 or more distinct customer classes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, stochastic models and simulation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03921 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many jurisdictions have launched antitrust enforcement and brought in regulation of large tech platforms. The swift and strict implementation of China’s Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy (Platform Guidelines) provides a quasi-natural experiment to evaluate the impact of antitrust regulation on platform competition. We adopt a difference-in-differences approach to empirically explore the impact of China’s Platform Guidelines on the number of investments and the entry of startups in platform markets. The results show that the Platform Guidelines did not increase entrepreneurship in these affected markets. Rather, entrepreneurship weakened in these markets, with less venture capital investment flowing into them and fewer startups entering these markets. Our study suggests that governments should consider more carefully the potential unintended consequences of antitrust platform regulation.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Managerial Prosocial Preferences and Guilt as an Emotional Barrier to Exit Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite economic setbacks, managers may resist exiting to avoid harming employees who will lose their jobs. We propose that managers with higher prosocial preferences set lower exit thresholds and select conservative investments that reduce the risk of having to exit because they experience stronger feelings of anticipatory guilt. Our field study shows that, in responding to intensifying Chinese import competition, prosocial managers are less likely to exit or divest. Our experiments (N = 1,411), including a sample of senior executives, show that anticipatory guilt mediates the negative effect of prosocial preferences on exit thresholds and risky investments. Anticipatory guilt and its effect are stronger when employees suffer greater harm from the firm’s exit due to the absence of social insurance programs, such as public health insurance or unemployment insurance. Our study presents an emotion-processual account of firm exit decisions and highlights anticipatory guilt as an emotional barrier to efficient decision-making.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02533 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How are asset price volatility and liquidity impacted by public perception of the economic state and by market competitivity? We wish to understand the direct impacts as well as indirect impacts via information acquisition and aggregation. To investigate, we design a laboratory experiment with human subjects as bond investors and exogenously vary the bond default rate, the private information cost schedule, and the market format. To discipline the experiment parameters and to obtain hypotheses for empirical testing, we construct a theoretical model that closely parallels the experiment. We find that the laboratory data support most theoretical predictions, for example, liquidity increases when traders purchase more precise private information, when public information indicates a less ominous state, and when the market is less competitive. Overall price volatility also increases with more precise private information and less competitivity, but it decreases with less ominous public information. Decomposing volatility into “efficient” and “inefficient” components may offer insight for policy analysis.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by University of California Santa Cruz.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04911 .</content>

    <title>Model Aggregation for Risk Evaluation and Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new approach for prudent risk evaluation based on stochastic dominance, and it is called the model aggregation (MA) approach. In contrast to the classic worst case risk (WR) approach, the MA approach produces not only a robust value of risk evaluation but also a robust distributional model, independent of any specific risk measure. The MA risk evaluation can be computed through explicit formulas in the lattice theory of stochastic dominance, and under some standard assumptions, the MA robust optimization admits a convex program reformulation. The MA approach for Wasserstein and mean-variance uncertainty sets admits explicit formulas for the obtained robust models. Via an equivalence property between the MA and WR approaches, new axiomatic characterizations are obtained for the value at risk and the expected shortfall (also known as conditional value at risk). The new approach is illustrated with various risk measures and examples from portfolio optimization.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12371476, 71921001, 71671176, 71871208], the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grants CRC-2022-00141, RGPIN-2024-03728, RGPAS-2018-522590, RGPIN-2018-03823], and the Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03523 .</content>

    <title>Examining the Effect of a Firm’s AI Specialization on the Technology Firms it Acquires: A Real Options Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The digital revolution is transforming global business practices. As organizations increasingly embed artificial intelligence (AI) within their operations, they face unprecedented uncertainty regarding future technological trajectories and competitive landscapes. To maintain competitiveness in the emerging technological space, they need to promptly acquire advanced knowledge to enrich their technological portfolio. Drawing on real options theory (ROT), our study integrates AI‐based acquisitions with internal AI development. We posit that a firm’s AI specialization represents the accumulation of critical technological knowledge and creates a portfolio of strategic options. These options can subsequently be exercised as AI acquisitions to secure complementary external capabilities. Moreover, the efficacy of these options is contingent on distinct uncertainties, including technical, modal, and complementarity uncertainties, captured by target R&amp;D intensity, target self‐fluidity, and product market overlap, respectively. Using a sample of US public firms that carried out acquisitions from 2004 to 2015, we find support for our hypotheses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the recognition that newcomers’ ego networks facilitate their adjustment, little is known about changes in their ego-network structures over time and potential drivers for the network changes. Drawing on coevolutionary theory of network dynamics and integrating insights from research on socialization dynamics, we examine the change-related, reciprocal relationships between perceived supervisor behaviors—specifically support and undermining—and structural holes in newcomers’ ego networks (i.e., the extent to which newcomers connect otherwise disconnected individuals). Using latent change score (LCS) modeling in a longitudinal study of new employees, we found evidence of coevolution: perceived supervisor undermining hindered their development of ego networks with increasingly more structural holes; in turn, newcomers who spanned structural holes in their ego networks experienced increasingly more supervisor undermining. Additionally, those whose networks are rich in structural holes perceived increasingly less supervisor support over time. These findings have implications for research on socialization and structural holes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the gig economy, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in managing human resource functions such as task allocation and performance management is increasingly significant. However, there is limited understanding of how the reliability of these functions, as experienced by workers, impacts their trust and engagement. Grounded in the transactional model of stress and coping, this study examines the influence of experienced algorithmic reliability on gig workers' trust in their platforms and their subsequent work engagement. We further explore how occupational stigma consciousness moderates this mediated relationship. Through a time‐lagged survey of 332 gig workers, our findings indicate that reliable algorithmic management experiences significantly enhance trust and subsequently work engagement. Moreover, this relationship is complicated by occupational stigma consciousness, which can diminish the positive effects of algorithmic reliability on trust and engagement. This study deepens our understanding of technology‐mediated work environments, emphasizing the critical role of workers' experiences with AI‐driven HRM functions in enhancing engagement and well‐being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend recent work on knowledge problems by observing that the complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty of entrepreneurship pertain not only to action-outcome likelihoods but also to the very criteria of entrepreneurial judgment. Most judgment criteria—value, opportunity, options, outcomes, etc.—are “fuzzy,” rendering much of entrepreneurial judgment imperfectly suited for probabilistic analysis. Fuzzy sets and natural language accommodate partial category membership, thus offering a more approximate representation of the remarkable ability of the entrepreneurial mind to conceptualize ill-structured and abstract problems. We explain how entrepreneurs use linguistic variables to navigate and convey the complex, gradient nature of uncertainty.</content>

    <title>‘Marching to Someone Else’s Beat or Creating Your Own Groove?’ Towards a Rhythmic Understanding of Context, (Entrepreneurial) Agency, and Transformative Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How contexts shape organizational phenomena has long been a focus of management and organization studies (MOS), as has how actors influence contexts. This paper deepens this debate using a rhythm perspective, developed against the backdrop of entrepreneurship research, which has made context a priority but not fully clarified how entrepreneurial agency alters contextual conditions. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre’sRhythmanalysis, we argue that the everyday provides a privileged vantage point for understanding how contextual forces permeate entrepreneurship and, conversely, how they are affected by it. Specifically, we theorize that the everyday forms a diverse and shifting symphony of rhythms, and suggest that entrepreneurial agency includes the transformative capacity to shape these rhythms to create tangible value. We refine our theorizing through the example of the Brukman textile factory, an entrepreneurial squat taken over by its former workers. The vignette explores how agency is enacted through the cultivation of moments of rupture (arrhythmia) and moments of rhythmic harmony (eurhythmia). Our contribution is to develop a rhythm perspective to spark new ways of thinking about context, agency, and transformative change. While our theorizing is rooted in entrepreneurship research, we identify ways in which it can stimulate MOS more broadly.</content>

    <title>‘Let Me Explain’: A Comparative Field Study on How Experts Enact Authority Over Clients When Facing AI Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With organizations increasingly relying on predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for decision‐making, experts lose the authority to overrule AI‐generated decisions yet remain responsible for presenting them to clients. As experts depend on clients’ recognition and approval of decisions, this shift presents a critical disruption to their authority. To investigate how experts respond to this challenge, we adopt a relational perspective that foregrounds the role of audiences in reconfiguring authority. Drawing on a comparative field study, we show how experts sought to reconstruct their authority by engaging in different activities to make clients understand and accept AI decisions, which we call ‘explaining practices’. These practices were shaped by two relational conditions: (1) whether clients recognized the expertise of human experts as unique; and (2) whether interactions between experts and clients provided rich opportunities for learning about clients’ evolving needs. When experts were able to learn about and tailor their explanations to those needs, clients could better make sense of AI decisions and were more willing to accept them, thereby reinforcing expert authority. By contrast, experts who failed to do so left clients with decisions they could not understand or endorse, undermining their authority. This study thereby offers new insights into the complex interplay between expert–client relationships, expert authority, and explaining practices.</content>

    <title>Helping Trajectories During Role Transitions: How They Vary and Why It Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While those transitioning into a new work role often rely on others to assist them, over time they are likely to also provide assistance to others. Accordingly, we examine the trajectories that the provision of such help by those transitioning take over time, as well as key trajectory determinants and socialization-related outcomes. Extending the Temporal Theory of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (TTOCB), we argue and find that such trajectories vary as a function of both the nature of the transition (i.e., transitioning as an organizational incumbent versus as an organizational newcomer), as well as the leadership and normative characteristics of the unit joined. Specifically, we propose and find that both newcomers and transitioning incumbents exhibit an inverted U-shaped helping trajectory, with the trajectory being significantly flatter for transitioning incumbents. Moreover, unit-level supportive leadership and peer descriptive helping norms moderate these trajectories. For both newcomers and transitioning incumbents, the helping trajectory is flatter in units with higher levels of supportive leadership or peer descriptive helping norms. Consistent with these dynamics, we hypothesize and find that variations in helping trajectories are associated with different levels of task performance, social integration, and turnover intentions one year after role entry. Specifically, individuals exhibiting higher and flatter helping trajectories demonstrate higher task performance, greater social integration, and lower turnover intentions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies using archival organizational structure data are not as prevalent as one might expect for such a critical strategy topic. We seek to facilitate more studies in this domain by introducing a novel, hand‐collected dataset of top management team compositions of S&amp;P 500 firms between 1993 and 2020. Alongside providing the original role titles, we use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to categorize executives' titles into 6 role groups and 12 hierarchical levels, enabling easier comparisons of structures across and within firms. Our findings not only align with prior research but also offer insights into industry‐specific structural changes, functional distributions within organizations, and the evolution of executive roles. This work also highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool to empirically investigate key strategy questions.Managerial SummaryOne of the most important decisions senior managers make pertains to defining their firms' organizational structures. However, obtaining data on firms' structures can be challenging due to difficulties in accessing data and comparing structures across firms. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset of top management team compositions of S&amp;P 500 firms between 1993 and 2020. Alongside providing the original names and job titles, we use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to categorize executives' titles into 6 role groups and 12 hierarchical levels, allowing easier comparisons of structures across and within firms. We hope that this new dataset will spur greater scholarly interest in organizational structure, offering insights into how firms are structured and the implications of these structures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how portfolio regulations affect risk sharing between financial institutions with market power. Unconstrained access to complete markets permits flexible exploitation of market power and induces inefficient risk sharing. Appropriate portfolio restrictions counteract this, improving liquidity and risk sharing by bundling securities with offsetting strategic incentives. However, excessive regulation can be counterproductive, destroying gains from trade. An application of our theory shows that cross-asset spillovers are critical for policy evaluation: in general equilibrium, risk sharing can improve even if certain asset-specific liquidity measures deteriorate. We also discuss the effects of asymmetric regulation for different institutions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We theoretically and empirically show how the reuse of Treasury securities as collateral alleviates safe asset scarcity. Our model characterizes how reuse allows intermediaries to efficiently reallocate the safety benefits of long-term Treasury securities to a broader investor base. By reusing Treasury securities, intermediaries can access more collateral to create safe assets without interest rate risk. When the demand for safe assets is high, intermediaries increase reuse, distributing safe asset benefits to investors that value safety the most. Using supervisory data to calculate a dealer-level measure of reuse called the “collateral multiplier,” we empirically confirm the model’s main predictions. (JEL E40, E51, G20, G12)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint, so that the re-solving technique is applied to alinear programwith additional slack variables amenable to practical computations and theoretical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Unraveling the Transformative Effects of Online Healthcare Consultation Services on Outpatient and Inpatient Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online healthcare consultation services (OHCS) hold immense potential to transform the healthcare industry. This study seeks to investigate the impact of doctors' participation in OHCS on offline outpatient and inpatient costs, addressing a critical yet underexplored area in the healthcare IT literature. Utilizing an exhaustive dataset from a high-level comprehensive hospital in China over a period of 42 months, we find that doctors' OHCS participation increases outpatient costs by 63.2% (¥268.510) and inpatient costs by 22.2% (¥2,365.092). These results remain robust after addressing endogeneity concerns through instrumental variable (IV) approaches and propensity score matching (PSM). Notably, mechanism tests reveal that OHCS participation enhances doctors' service volume expansion, cost-upgrading within services and patient mix changes, leading to induced demand and higher offline medical costs. Moreover, these effects are amplified for doctors with higher professional status. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and higher department crowding levels tend to mitigate these cost increases. This study makes several significant theoretical contributions. First, it expands the healthcare IT literature by uncovering the "dark side" of OHCS participation, showing that it raises medical costs by altering supply-demand dynamics, contrary to the cost-saving potential often associated with traditional healthcare IT. Second, it advances research on OHCS by identifying the mechanisms—service volume expansion, cost-upgrading within services and patient mix changes—through which OHCS participation influences offline costs. Third, it explores the heterogeneous effects of physician, environmental, and departmental characteristics on medical costs. Practically, our findings suggest that hospitals and policymakers should promote widespread OHCS participation to balance supply-demand dynamics, advance treatment standardization and differentiated payment models, establish a multi-dimensional physician performance evaluation system, and leverage AI technology to improve doctor-patient matching and resource scheduling—enabling the realization of online healthcare's potential without inadvertently driving up medical costs. This study highlights the nuanced implications of OHCS on offline healthcare costs, offering insights for improving its implementation in healthcare systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When ‘Year’ Feels near: How Year versus Length Framing Alters Time Perception and Consumer Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Time intervals can be framed either by a calendar year (e.g., “2015”) or by length (e.g., “10 years”), yet these ostensibly equivalent formats lead to systematically different judgments. Combining data from whiskey auctions with seven controlled experiments, we demonstrate that length framing elongates time perception compared to year framing, which we refer to as the year–length effect. As a result of changes in time perception, length framing increases the importance of time-related attributes in choice, leading to more favorable product evaluations in contexts where age enhances product value (e.g., whiskey evaluation) and to more negative evaluations in contexts where age reduces it (e.g., used goods). Process evidence implicates the logarithmic mental number line: years with large nominal values occupy a compressed region of the line, relative to small length numerals. These findings offer practical guidance on how time framing can be used to shape time perception and customer value.</content>

    <title>The Role of Status Incongruence in Employee Responses to Participative Leadership</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has focused on the negative effect of status incongruence, this paper offers an optimistic perspective as it relates to participative leadership. Status incongruence refers to a situation in which status characteristics of the supervisor and the subordinate are opposite to standard norms. Leaders who are younger, less educated, less experienced, or shorter tenured than their followers are status incongruent. Incorporating role congruity theory with the participative leadership literature, we argue that participative leaders in status incongruence will be able to boost subordinate affective commitment and organizational citizenship behaviors more than their counterparts with lower status incongruence. We further propose a moderated mediation model whereby the positive indirect relationship between participative leadership and subordinate organizational citizenship behaviors through affective commitment will be stronger for status incongruent dyads. By finding support for our hypotheses across two field studies, this work suggests role congruity theory to consider leadership style as well as multiple status indicators together in understanding how role (in)congruity arises for leaders with varying levels of status incongruence. Suggestions for how human resource (HR) managers should consider leadership style as part of their HR strategy for fostering participative workplaces are offered.</content>
