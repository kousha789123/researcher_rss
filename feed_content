    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interconnected agents such as firms in a supply chain make simultaneous preparatory investments to increase chances of honoring their respective bilateral agreements. Failures cascade with lasting repercussions further down the chain. How losses are shared affects how agents invest to avoid the losses in the first place. In this way, a solution sets agent liabilities depending on the point of disruption and induces a supermodular investment game. We characterize all efficient solutions. These have the form that later agents—who are not directly liable for the disruption—still shoulder some of the losses, justified on the premise that they might have failed anyway. Importantly, we find that such indirect liabilities are necessary to avoid unbounded inefficiencies. Finally, we pinpoint one efficient solution with several desirable properties.This paper was accepted by Peng Sun, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond [Grant 4260-00050B] and Carlsbergfondet [Grant CF18-1112].</content>

    <title>Market Design Choices, Racial Discrimination, and Equitable Microentrepreneurship in Digital Marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the potential of market design choices, specifically quality certification, to mitigate racial discrimination in digital marketplaces. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the discontinuity in Airbnb’s Superhost assignment, we find that Black hosts benefit 1.5 times more from the quality certification than other hosts. Moreover, we find compelling evidence that this disproportionate increase does not come at the expense of non-Superhost Black hosts. This suggests that quality certification can effectively reduce discrimination and promote equitable outcomes. Further, our analysis utilizing a doubly robust machine learning approach reveals that the effectiveness of quality certification persists even in the prominent presence of consumer reviews, a widely used market feature and a credible user-generated quality signal. Our research underscores the judicious use of market design in fostering equity for minority entrepreneurs in digital marketplaces.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01717 .</content>

    <title>Small worlds within global supply chains: implications for multinational enterprises’ environmental, social, and governance controversies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With increasing public attention to corporate sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) controversies emerging in global supply chains present a growing problem for multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper investigates whether MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers are more likely to be exposed to supplier-related ESG controversies. It also explores structural characteristics of global supply chains that can mitigate MNEs’ exposure to such controversies. Building on the literature on supply chain complexity and small-world networks, we suggest that the small-worldness of an MNE’s supply chain network can mitigate the impact of the geographical dispersion of suppliers on supplier-induced ESG controversies. Our analysis of the Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies from 2010 to 2019 reveals that MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers suffer from more supplier-induced ESG controversies, while small-worldness attenuates such impact. Our findings contribute to the international business literature by highlighting small-worldness as a network structural characteristic that can be deployed by MNEs to mitigate the negative impacts of supply chain spatial complexity.</content>

    <title>Real Effects of Non‐Streamlined Sales Tax Administration: Evidence from the Florida Hotel Industry</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether the local administration of sales taxes (as opposed to a more streamlined state administration) affects the real economy for businesses complying with the tax. We study this question in the Florida hotel industry, as counties in Florida can choose to locally administer the county‐level tourist tax or have the state administer the county‐level tax along with the state‐level tourist tax. Local administration is popular because it supports local employment (of tax administrators) and provides more stringent enforcement on non‐commercial operators (e.g., private rentals). State administration, however, has fewer compliance costs for hotels (e.g., reduced filings and fewer audits). Commentary from the profession suggests the incremental compliance costs of local administration can be considerable. We find that counties switching from state to local administration of tourist taxes is associated with slower growth in aggregate hotel payroll and employment, consistent with local tax administration increasing compliance costs to the point that affected businesses cut other services.</content>

    <title>From Smartphones to Smart Students: Learning vs. Distraction Using Smartphones in the Classroom</title>
    <updated>2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study evaluates the impact of classroom smartphone use on student performance through two large-scale randomized controlled trials in China. Students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (i) smartphones banned, (ii) smartphones allowed and used at will without guidance, (iii) smartphones allowed with teacher prompts to use them for instruction, and (iv) smartphones banned with teachers prompting the use of paper-based aids. Our findings show that unstructured smartphone use reduced performance compared with banning them, whereas teacher-guided use significantly enhanced learning outcomes. Paper-based aids yielded no measurable performance gain over the ban. We analyzed classroom video recordings to track individual-level time spent in each condition. We found that students spent similar total time learning across conditions, but teacher-directed smartphone use produced disproportionately large marginal learning gains outweighing the losses from distraction. Guided use also helped close gender and performance gaps though it risked widening digital divides by major and region. These results suggest educators should receive support to develop purposeful, app-based smartphone instruction materials; policymakers should avoid blanket bans and instead adopt structured usage policies; and tech developers should design classroom-friendly tools aligned with instructional goals. With thoughtful implementation, smartphones can become engines of equity, positive engagement, and learning within the classroom.</content>

    <title>On-Demand Healthcare Platforms: Impact of Question and Answer Service on Online Consultations and Offline Appointments</title>
    <updated>2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand healthcare platforms are increasingly integrating low-cost question and answer (Q&amp;A) services to help patients navigate care options. Using data from a major Chinese health platform, this study shows that Q&amp;A services drive both online and offline engagement—boosting online consultations by 2%, offline appointments by 4.3%, and consultation revenue by 6.6%. These services not only encourage follow-ups with the same doctor but also, generate spillover demand to other providers and specialties, especially those with higher professional titles. Patients benefit through better provider matching, fewer revisits, and reduced time spent browsing for care—all of which suggest improved outcomes. Q&amp;A serves as an effective entry point, reducing uncertainty and guiding patients to the appropriate level of care. From an operational perspective, the service increases demand without cannibalizing higher-margin services, offering a low-cost lever for engagement and conversion. Platforms should incentivize generalists and junior doctors, who often serve as initial touchpoints and channel traffic to specialists, to maximize the broader impact of Q&amp;A engagement. For providers and policymakers, the findings highlight how lightweight, scalable tools, like Q&amp;A, can improve care access and coordination—especially in fragmented systems where patients select providers without formal referrals.</content>

    <title>Changing tracks: How status affects category shifts in the Korean popular music industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how producers' status shapes their strategies for category shifting of their artists. Unlike prior research emphasizing its limitations, we argue that in creative industries, category shifting can offer substantial advantages. Focusing on producer‐driven markets, we propose that middle‐status producers align artists with market‐dominant categories, while high‐status ones pursue periodic radical shifts. However, for female artists, producers' influence on category shifts is constrained by audience expectations rooted in stricter institutional gender norms. Using a unique dataset from the Korean popular music industry, we find support for our hypotheses. We show that entertainment agencies' status influences the category‐shifting behaviors of idol groups. Yet, the impact of producer status is moderated by the broader gender expectations in which the artists are embedded.Managerial SummaryThis study explores how producers' status influences their approach to positioning their artists within existing market categories. Contrary to previous views focusing largely on limitations, we argue that category shifting in creative industries can bring significant benefits. In markets where producers drive the creative process, we suggest that those with moderate status tend to shift to follow popular categories, while high‐status ones opt for more radical changes. However, female artists face tighter constraints due to institutional norms. Drawing from data in the Korean popular music industry, we find evidence supporting our theory. We demonstrate how the status of entertainment agencies affects the category shifts of idol groups, though this effect is limited by broader gender expectations surrounding the artists.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In four large online experiments, we study how investors assess the relationship between stock portfolios and the market. Participants select or are randomly assigned a portfolio of stocks from a market index. They state portfolio return expectations conditional on different market outcomes, revealing implied beliefs about portfolio beta. We find general underestimation of beta which is stronger for downside beta. This asymmetry is amplified for participants who select their portfolio. They believe their portfolio goes up with the market but does not come down with it. We confirm biased beliefs about beta with financial professionals, monetary incentives, and alternative belief elicitation methods.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Seat Selection Surcharge and Allocation Policy in Selling High-Speed Train Tickets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a dynamic capacity control problem with seat selection and dynamic surcharge in the railway industry. In such problems, passenger arrives with a request for an itinerary, having a seat preference and a certain willingness-to-pay for seat preference. The decision-maker needs to decide at each time period whether to open each itinerary, a surcharge for each seat type in each open itinerary, and a seat assignment for each accepted request. The distinguishing feature of this problem is that the seat assignment decision is closely related to the surcharge decision — if the passenger chooses to pay the surcharge, then we must assign him/her a seat of preference, otherwise we can assign the passenger any seat on the train. Moreover, each accepted passenger must be assigned to a unique seat throughout the journey and it is not allowed to use a combination of seats to serve a passenger.We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem involving seat allocation and dynamic surcharge pricing. We consider a static problem in which demands of all requests are known but their arrival periods are unknown, and introduce a set of assignment consistency constraints to ensure the feasibility of opening and surcharge decisions when willingness-to-pay is uncertain. We then propose dynamic policies based on the static problem. In particular, we propose a booking limit control policy, two bid-price control policies and a re-solving a dynamic primal policy, and study the asymptotic loss of these policies. We also conduct numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of proposed policies and the potential gain of setting dynamic surcharges.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving Health Outcomes with Less Cost? Provision of Mobile Clinic in Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a public healthcare system consisting of a hospital, a mobile clinic (MC), and a population of potential patients. The government is concerned about the system’s healthcare spending and the population’s health outcomes. It decides the frequency and capacity of the MC service to maximize the social welfare that consists of two terms: the system’s long-run average healthcare cost and the population’s average quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We characterize the population’s natural disease progression using a Markov cohort model and derive the average healthcare cost incurred for the system and the average QALY in closed form for a given MC service. We show that the government is more likely to provide the MC service when (i) it puts more weight on the population’s average QALY, (ii) the MC treatment becomes more efficient, or (iii) the hospital treatment cost is much higher relative to the MC treatment cost. We further show that when conditions (ii) and (iii) are met or the disease progresses faster, the provision of the MC service is more likely to result in a win-win outcome, leading to both healthcare cost reduction and QALY improvement. The optimal MC delivery policy highly hinges on the disease’s progressive speed. Specifically, when the MC service is designated to serve a specific target population, once the MC service is provided, it shall be provided either every period or every other period if the disease is fast-progressive. If the disease is slow-progressive, the long-run average healthcare cost exhibits a zigzag pattern with the MC delivery cycle when the relative treatment cost-saving per person induced by the provision of the MC service is positive. Last, we conduct a real case study. Our analysis reveals that the optimal implementation of the MC program results in a 119.5% improvement in QALY and a 5% reduction in healthcare costs. The results are robust in probabilistic sensitivity analysis with a relative performance gap within 11.5% when factoring in uncertainty of the parameters.</content>

    <title>Transaction Fee Mechanisms and User Welfare in Permissionless Blockchains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A transaction fee is fundamental in maintaining the stability and decentralization of a permissionless blockchain, the infrastructure underlying major cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. This fee, set and paid by users when initiating each transaction, aggregates to over $24 million daily on Ethereum, imposing a nontrivial barrier to wider adoption. What is worse is that it is disproportionately borne by small users. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum started with a name-your-own-price style fee mechanism. Under this Legacy mechanism, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, only three-quarters of the transaction fee is necessary for users to attain the service quality they receive; the remaining one-quarter thus constitutes welfare loss. In August 2021, Ethereum implemented a fee mechanism change. Together, the Legacy methods and the new scheme, which we call Cap-Tip, describe the two most widely used fee mechanisms in all major permissionless blockchains. We explain the innovations embedded in the Cap-Tip mechanism through the lens of information quality and task decomposition. Collecting over 123 million transactions covering the change period, we estimate the causal impact of Cap-Tip on welfare improvement using a doubly robust difference-in-difference estimator that accommodates heterogeneity across timing of and exposure after adoption. The result is an astounding 80% reduction in welfare loss, achieved by users only 6 days after adoption. Interestingly, we also find that adoption benefits small users more than large ones, alleviating fee disparity and improving fairness. We theorize this difference through user experience and the overconfidence bias. Our study offers a novel operational perspective to unpack how the arguably most significant fee mechanism change in the blockchain space affects user welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stabilize the Dual Value and Alleviate the Primal Degeneracy of Linear Programs SimultaneouslyDual-optimal and deep dual-optimal inequalities (DOIs/DDOIs) are known to aid dual stabilization and accelerate convergence. In “Nested Set-Covering/Packing Problem: Degeneracy Alleviation and Dual Stabilization,” Siqi Guo, Fan Xiao, and Zhe Liang observe that DOIs/DDOIs also increase primal degeneracy, thereby extra effort is needed to prove optimality. Therefore, when addressing linear programs, it is critical to stabilize the dual as well as reduce primal degeneracy. This paper studies a nested multistage set-covering problem and proposes a nested set-covering model, which can be viewed as a traditional set-covering problem with special DDOIs. The authors derive strengthened reduced costs that can prescreen and prune degenerate variables and a pruning-and-pricing mechanism that utilizes both standard and strengthened reduced costs to price out promising variables. An efficient nested column-and-row generation algorithm is developed to exploit the benefits of both dual stabilization and degeneracy alleviation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Middle-Mile E-Commerce Order FulfillmentIn “E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Problem with Limited Time Window,” Zhou, Gümüş, and Miao investigate how online retailers can improve order fulfillment by utilizing the limited fulfillment window in middle-mile logistics. The authors first characterize an optimal policy and then, introduce two simple heuristic approaches for fulfillment decisions based on Lagrangian relaxation. They show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal when the number of demand locations increases. They also discover that integrating the information about remaining fulfillment windows into the decision-making process can yield additional benefits. Their findings suggest that online retailers can gain a competitive advantage by offering customers options, such as a “two-day fulfillment” service instead of a “same-day fulfillment” service, particularly when faced with limited logistical capacities.</content>

    <title>Does Privacy Regulation Harm Content Providers? A Longitudinal Analysis of the Impact of the GDPR</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns that the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would adversely affect the ability of news and media websites to create new quality content have not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. We construct a longitudinal data set of European Union (EU) and U.S. news and media websites to study how online content providers responded to the GDPR over time and whether potential restrictions on online tracking enforced by the regulation affected their downstream outcomes. We find robust evidence that both EU and U.S. news and media websites responded to the regulation by altering their data collection practices, but did so differently, with EU websites reducing tracking and implementing consent mechanisms at higher rates than their U.S. counterparts. Although we detect a reduction in average page views per user on EU relative to U.S. websites, we do not find evidence of negative impacts, in both the short and long term, on EU websites’ provision of new content or on several proxies for quality of that content, such as social media engagement metrics, various traffic measures, and articles’ text analytics. We also find no evidence of differences in survival rates across EU and U.S. news and media websites, and no evidence that monetization strategies changed at higher rates on EU relative to U.S. websites. The analysis suggests that EU online content providers did implement changes to their data collection practices in response to the GDPR but were able to use data minimization and consent mechanism strategies that allowed them to keep producing content and engage audiences at degrees on par with their U.S. counterparts.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What influences consumers to make product decisions alone versus with household partners? This research examines how consumers’ preference for solo or joint decision-making with household partners varies between product acquisition and disposal stages. Ten pre-registered studies demonstrate that for many household products, consumers are more likely to choose joint (vs. solo) decision-making with household partners for disposal than for acquisition. This asymmetry occurs because disposal (vs. acquisition) increases perceptions of the potential for infringement on a household partner’s rights, which increases the desire for clarity about a partner’s product valuation and thus the choice of joint (vs. solo) decision-making with one’s partner. The authors identify three process-consistent boundary conditions, wherein this acquisition-disposal asymmetry is mitigated: (1) when the product cannot be used by one’s partner, (2) when considering decisions with non-household members (e.g., non-cohabitating close friends) instead of one’s household partner, and (3) when the product’s price exceeds the household’s typical budget. Moreover, the authors discuss implications of this acquisition-disposal asymmetry for consumer well-being and marketing strategies, including its potential to cause delays in disposal decisions relative to acquisition decisions. This research contributes to understanding household decision dynamics and identifies a novel contributor to overaccumulation of household products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Package weight and calorie judgments play an important role in food-related consumer decisions. In this paper, the authors hypothesize and demonstrate that the bi-directional relationship between package stability and objective weight leads consumers to perceive visually more stable shapes as subjectively heavier: the “shape stability effect” (Study 1). The stability effect is mitigated (replicated) when the context makes volume (weight) judgments more accessible than weight (volume) judgments (Study 2). The shape stability effect has consequences for calorie perceptions (Study 3A) and consumption decisions (Study 3B). We also examined the implications for consumers’ WTP (Study 4A). Analysis of an archival data set (Study 4B) shows that for tasty (healthy) products, price is positively (negatively) associated with shape stability. Theoretically, these results add to the literature on volume and weight judgments, and calorie perceptions. Managerial implications for food packaging and positioning are offered.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Benefits from Alternative Data for Credit Scoring? Evidence from Peru</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion individuals worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to credit due to the absence of traditional credit scores. In this paper, we demonstrate how retail transaction data can be used to construct an alternative credit score, potentially expanding credit access for these individuals. Our study utilizes a unique dataset obtained through a partnership with a Peruvian company. We merge customer loyalty data and credit card repayment data with administrative records from the Peruvian financial system, which provide detailed financial histories of individuals. This comprehensive dataset allows us to construct credit scores for individuals both with and without a credit history. Through simulations of credit card approval decisions, we find that incorporating retail data increases approval rates for individuals without a credit history, from 16% to between 31% and 48%. In contrast, for those with an established credit history, approval rates remain largely unchanged at around 88%. We investigate why retail data particularly benefits individuals without a credit history and discuss the broader implications of this credit scoring methodology for consumers, firms, and policymakers. Our findings highlight its potential to transform credit access for millions of previously unbanked individuals.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Self-Preferencing on Digital Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms facilitate exchanges between platform actors, such as trading between buyers and sellers. However, providers of digital platforms also compete with other actors, referred to as third parties, on their own platforms. In such settings,self-preferencingcan occur if the platform treats its own offerings better than comparable third-party offerings—a practice often deemed inappropriate. However, detecting self-preferencing is challenging. This article addresses this challenge conceptually and empirically by putting forward a conceptual framework that defines self-preferencing and conceptualizes two self-preferencing tests. It implements this framework empirically in two studies across three international Amazon marketplaces using a novel metric to measure a product’s non-personalized visibility. The aggregate findings provide little evidence for self-preferencing in both studies. However, the more disaggregated findings at a country- and product category-level vary from weak self-preferencing to strong self-depreferencing. As implementing self-preferencing tests requires researchers to choose between several empirical alternatives and assumptions, the approach proposed herein includes extensive sensitivity, specification curve, and heterogeneity analyses whose results support the robustness of the findings.</content>

    <title>Gaining Career Purpose Through Lightning Bolts: Examining the Strength and Psychological Foundations of Work-Related Epiphanies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Epiphanies—sudden realizations that transform how people see themselves—have the potential to infuse people’s personal and professional lives with a renewed sense of purpose. Yet, the prominence and potency of epiphanies as purpose-giving vehicles has largely been overlooked in management and organization studies. In the research reported here, we investigate epiphanies and their psychological foundations. Specifically, we build and test theory on what types of individuals, psychologically speaking, are more likely to experience epiphanies of greater strength related to their work and careers. We evaluate the strength of the work-related epiphanies that people experienced over the course of their lives (Study 1) and in the context of a leadership development program (Study 2) and a leadership coaching workshop (Study 3). Consistent with our theorizing, we find that people who engage in a form of mind wandering known as “problem-solving daydreaming” are more likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength. Furthermore, we find that people who engage in problem-solving daydreaming are especially likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength when they possess a form of curiosity that compels them to solve their problems (“deprivation sensitivity”). Work-related epiphany strength, in turn, transmits this conditional effect onto people’s sense of purpose in their careers via psychological tension resolution. These results illuminate psychological phenomena underlying sudden shifts in how people view themselves and open new windows into how a heightened sense of career purpose can emerge among individuals on a managerial career path.</content>

    <title>Global ecological dependence and multinationals’ climate innovation: the role of climate risk exposure and institutional conditions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change poses significant global challenges to multinational enterprises (MNEs). One crucial solution hinges on the development of new technologies to mitigate climate change or adapt to its adverse effects. However, it remains unclear what factors can effectively motivate MNEs’ development of climate innovation. Integrating the resource dependence theory and the natural resource-based view, we argue that MNEs’ strategies are shaped by their dependence on the global ecological environment for natural resources—coined here asglobal ecological dependence. When exposed to elevated climate risks, MNEs tend to engage in climate innovation to assuage the uncertainty associated with their global ecological dependence. This tendency is moderated by climate-related formal and informal institutions that alter the perceived benefits and costs of climate innovation: stringent regulatory demand for climate action weakens this tendency as it increases firm costs and can divert resources, whereas heightened societal demand enhances this tendency as it can increase MNEs’ perception of the benefits of climate innovation. We find evidence for our hypotheses in a panel of MNEs listed in the United States from 1995 to 2017. Our study contributes to resource dependence theory and extends our understanding of climate innovation as a viable solution to climate change.</content>

    <title>Blockchains for Environmental Monitoring: Theory and Empirical Evidence from China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the effects of a blockchain-based environmental monitoring technology on emissions. Our model of firm competition in the presence of regional regulators reveals that blockchain adoption reduces industrial pollution but triggers business relocation, creating trade-offs between local emission reduction and economic contraction. When pollution-induced social losses are highly dispersed across cities, a partial-adoption equilibrium fails to mitigate aggregate emissions because of the pollution leakage. We further present the first piece of empirical evidence corroborating model predictions, by taking advantage of a recent regulation change in China. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, and CO in blockchain-adopting cities are on average 16.6%, 7.9% and 4.6%, respectively, lower than other cities. However, blockchain-based monitoring disproportionately hurts the industrial sector, and the average economic activities is reduced by 1.8%-2.6%. Firms in adopting cities open more non-local plants to avoid regulation.</content>

    <title>Social‐Symbolic Work of Engaging Heterogeneous Communities: Participation Work and Entangled Effects on Organizations and Communities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Community participation is recognized as a crucial yet problematic element for addressing many issues in social development. Generating participation, however, is particularly challenging due to existing inequalities within heterogeneous communities, making it difficult for organizations to engage marginalized groups while letting go of their own control. We explore how organizations facilitate community participation through a qualitative comparative case study of two community radio stations in India. We find two approaches based on how organizations leverage three levels of influence: (1)open participation workleverages community members as audience and volunteers/staff by drawing on commonality between them. Furthermore, it defers decision making to community hierarchy; (2)protective participation workengages audience and volunteers/staff from marginalized groups, focusing on their differences from other community members, and defies community hierarchy in decision making. These two approaches led to contrasting outcomes: open participation work led to a pliable organization that invited the community in, but preserved community inequalities, and protective participation work led to a directive organization that restricted participation, but disrupted community inequalities. In unpacking these approaches, we extend the social‐symbolic work literature by theorizing how participation work creates entangled effects on the organization and community.</content>

    <title>What If We Are the WEIRD Ones? A Call (and Roadmap) for More Non-WEIRD Entrepreneurship Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship researchers have focused on WEIRD samples—that is, Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic samples. This editorial suggests that not all theories formed on and tested with WEIRD samples are generalizable to non-WEIRD contexts. A richer picture of entrepreneurial phenomena can come from non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research, especially (but not exclusively) by non-WEIRD researchers with local knowledge and interests. In this editorial, we hope to motivate more non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research by highlighting the potential problems with the dominance of a WEIRD perspective in our most impactful research, introducing each element of a non-WEIRD approach to solve those problems, and offering some big-picture thoughts and methods as future research opportunities. Indeed, we provide research opportunities that could lead to contextualized entrepreneurship theories embedded in contexts not well represented in the mainstream entrepreneurship literature, largely devoted to the WEIRD. We conclude this editorial with recommendations for reviewers and editors of these mainstream entrepreneurship journals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an agenda setting seminar in 1997, when entrepreneurship was just emerging as a serious field of scholarship, Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow offered a challenging null hypothesis, namely, that entrepreneurship being a stochastic phenomenon, educational content is unlikely to make a difference in startup rates or success thereafter. With a view to begin tackling this null, we utilize a nationwide educational reform as a quasi‐experiment to investigate the effect of business and entrepreneurship‐oriented education on (i) early age startup (i.e., direct effects) and (ii) postgraduation choices that may lead to startup activity later (i.e., indirect effects). We find evidence for positive direct and indirect effects and discuss implications for future research into the design of entrepreneurship education policies as well as content and teacher training.Managerial SummaryA variety of entrepreneurship programs exist at prestigious universities to stimulate startup for students who enroll in these based on entrepreneurial preferences and intentions. The resulting new ventures created are important drivers of innovation, economic growth, and job creation. Our study indicates that exposure to business and entrepreneurship content at an earlier age is equally important. Both in terms of obtaining a realistic insight into entrepreneurship as a career, leading to more realized startups of high quality but also in terms of developing a preference for entrepreneurship affecting subsequent choices regarding tertiary education and employment in favor of future entrepreneurship. We suggest investments in broadening entrepreneurship education for all in contrast to for specific targeted groups such as university or technology entrepreneurs.</content>

    <title>The signal of institutional governance in early‐stage financing for university spinoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;University spinoffs (USOs) translate scientific advancement to economic gains, but the role of the university's governance as a public or private institution is infrequently explored. With a novel dataset of academic entrepreneurs with National Science Foundation I‐Corps training, we examine institutional governance as a fundraising signal. We demonstrate how angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) show a preference for private USOs. However, with different investment objectives, the groups conduct distinct sensemaking that weighs this cue differently. For angels, industry moderates the effect such that they prefer private university life science firms to public USOs. However, industry mediates the effect for VCs, who prefer life sciences to engineering. We describe this variation as mixed salience—when a signal yields differences in decision‐making for distinct audiences.Managerial SummaryUniversity spinoffs (USOs) are important for economic growth, but little is known about differences between USOs from public and private universities. We study how angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) fund USOs of public and private schools. These two investor groups make funding decisions with different priorities and approaches. Both groups appear to prefer private universities. A deeper look reveals that angel investors prefer private university life science teams to the public university counterparts. On the other hand, VCs prefer life sciences teams to engineering teams—and life sciences teams are more likely to come from private schools. Evidently, the two investor audiences respond to the public/private distinction in different ways.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the infrastructure of decentralized exchanges subjects liquidity providers (LPs) to a “tragedy of the commons.” Liquidity providers lack incentives to exit liquidity pools to prevent arbitrage losses, as these are collectively shared, while withdrawal costs are borne individually. Arbitrage rents primarily flow to validators as infrastructure fees, with the median arbitrageur transferring 96% of profits. Proposed solutions—speed technology, alternative sequencing rules, and flexible pricing curves—fail to reduce these rents. Leveraging the Silicon Valley Bank crisis as a natural experiment, we show that LPs defensively adopt more convex pricing curves to mitigate adverse selection risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new asset pricing model that generalizes the mean-variance framework by including probability weighting, specifically the overweighting of rare, high-impact events. Our model—the Π-CAPM—generates several new predictions: (i) skewness has a positive price effect, amplified by volatility; (ii) the price effect of volatility is negative for left-skewed assets but positive for right-skewed assets; and (iii) option-implied variance premiums for stocks have a U-shaped relation to skewness, amplified by volatility. We find strong empirical support for these predictions. Finally, we show that the Π-CAPM predicts an exaggerated co-movement of assets and can explain the correlation premium.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use publicly available information to estimate the country location of multinational firms’ cash holdings, examine why investors discount the value of cash held overseas, and examine whether that discount changes after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. We provide three main results. First, our firm-year foreign cash estimates are reasonably accurate, evidenced by high correlations with simulated data and proprietary country-level data, high adjusted R2when explaining a firm’s total cash holdings, and the ability to replicate prior findings. Second, we demonstrate that investors value foreign cash holdings more negatively than domestic cash holdings when the cash is held in high agency-cost countries. Finally, we find that investors no longer appear to discount foreign cash after the TCJA, when the U.S. moved from a worldwide to a quasi-territorial taxation system.</content>

    <title>CFO narcissism and the power of persuasion over analysts: a mixed-methods approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of CFO narcissism in the intent and ability to positively influence sell-side analysts’ perceptions of the firm. Consistent with narcissists casting favorable impressions on others, we find CFO narcissism is associated with overly optimistic analyst valuations. We then study public persuasion attempts by analyzing conference call transcripts and private persuasion attempts through a laboratory study. In the conference call setting, we show that narcissistic CFOs use more persuasive language and are more inclined to call on bearish analysts, both of which we link to price target revisions following the call. In the lab study, we simulate a one-on-one conversation and find that narcissists are especially more likely to use coercive methods to induce higher valuations from analysts. Collectively, we show that narcissistic CFOs use persuasion to favorably influence analysts’ perceptions of firm value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the effect of climate risks on corporate bond mutual funds’ trading activities and explores its mechanism. We find that investor flows negatively respond to mutual funds’ carbon exposure, using the Paris Agreement as a shock event. Such carbon-induced redemptions prompt mutual funds to sell bonds issued by high-carbon companies, especially for funds with high outflow-to-carbon sensitivity. Our findings do not support the alternative hypothesis that a fundamental shift in funds’ investment preferences drives the reduction in high-carbon holdings. Finally, we document a deterioration in the liquidity of high-carbon bonds, particularly those heavily owned by mutual funds.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between temperature changes and firm performance using a novel time-varying measure of firm-level temperature sensitivity. We find that firms with higher temperature sensitivity have lower future profitability and riskier corporate policies. These firms are also overpriced and earn lower average future returns as market participants are slow to correct the mispricing. Nonlocal institutional investors allocate higher portfolio weights to firms with high temperature sensitivity, and sell-side equity analyst forecasts are less accurate for these firms. Together, these results suggest that financial markets underreact to information about firm-level temperature sensitivity, and this generates predictable patterns in returns. A trading strategy that exploits this mispricing generates an annualized risk-adjusted return of more than 4% during the 1968–2020 period.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00972 .</content>

    <title>Mitigating Exposure Bias for Recommendations in Physical Spaces: An Unbiased Pairwise Ranking Approach Using Spatial Movement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the remarkable success of personalized recommendations on digital platforms, brick-and-mortar businesses are increasingly exploring artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommendation services in physical spaces. To address this emerging need, our study introduces a generalized recommendation problem, termed point-of-interest (POI) recommendations in physical spaces with pedestrian movement (P3M). Applicable scenarios for P3M include store recommendations in shopping malls, product shelf recommendations in hypermarkets, and so on. A critical impediment in P3M is exposure bias: When the exposure likelihood of items to users is unevenly distributed, indiscriminately treating all unobserved interactions as negative feedback introduces bias to the learning of recommender systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel recommendation method, unbiased movement-aware pairwise ranking (UMPR), which integrates pedestrian movement modeling with unbiased pairwise learning to achieve effective and unbiased recommendations. Using real-world shopping mall data, we demonstrate that UMPR not only delivers more accurate recommendations compared to state-of-the-art methods but also brings added monetary value for mall owners and promotes humanistic fairness across store tenants. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of mitigating exposure bias through pedestrian movement modeling, advancing the field of recommendations in physical spaces.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We first document that, despite potential legal issues, overlapping directors are surprisingly prevalent among direct competitors. Using panel data regressions and plausibly exogenous shocks, we find that competing firms in markets with dense overlapping-director networks experience innovation herding, lose product differentiation, and, ultimately, perform poorly. Novel text-based network propagation tests of technologies show that intellectual property leakage plays a role as firms with dense overlapping director networks experience faster propagation of technologies to competitors. Our findings suggest a coordination problem where industry participants cannot stop rivals from earning small gains from leakage despite much larger industry-wide negative externalities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should the seller display all available products in a setting with multiple products or only offer a subset? Is there a benefit of withholding some products? The seller does not want to display low-margin products due to cannibalization, but what if all products have the same margin? In “Performance of the Offer-Everything Policy,” W. T. Huh, J. Paat, and M. Queyranne argue that in an environment where the seller cannot adjust assortment based on customer types, it is best to offer all available products in an environment. The analysis is based on competitive ratio and expected revenue. This research assures that a common practice of truthfully revealing product availability is a generally good policy to follow.</content>

    <title>Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although experimental design often focuses on selecting the single best alternative from a finite set, many pure-exploration problems pursue richer goals. Given a specific goal, adaptive experimentation aims to achieve it by strategically allocating sampling effort, with the underlying sample complexity characterized by a maximin optimization problem. In "Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration," Qin and You introduce a unified dual-directed framework for efficiently solving general pure-exploration problems, yielding a unified algorithm design principle that extends the top-two approach beyond best-arm identification. Their theoretical analysis proves asymptotic optimality for classical problems, such as Gaussian best-arm identification, thresholding bandits, and epsilon-best-arm identification. Extensive numerical experiments confirm these theoretical insights, showcasing significant improvements over existing methods. This dual-directed framework offers researchers and practitioners a powerful and versatile tool to navigate uncertainty and optimize exploration strategies effectively.</content>

    <title>A Separation of Utility and Beliefs Through Betting Consistency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For standard preferences under uncertainty, minimal requirements are proposed to identify cardinal utility and subjective, potentially nonadditive, beliefs. This is achieved through an application of betting consistency. This preference principle says that outcome midpoints derived from preferences over bets on an event are also midpoints when elicited from bets on a different event. This consistency requirement provides a simplified elicitation tool, while it also serves as a robustness test for utility measurements. An analyst can use betting consistency to identify a client’s cardinal utility index independent of the client’s beliefs. This follows from our simplified foundation for the biseparable utility model, the widely adopted framework for empirical measurements of utility under various sources of uncertainty. As a theoretical tool, betting consistency can be adopted to provide simple and intuitive foundations for new and for existing decision theories. For instance, an event-dependent version of betting consistency, if it is supplemented with Savage’s sure-thing principle or a version of that principle restricted to acts that satisfy Schmeidler’s comonotonicity property, delivers subjective expected utility or Choquet expected utility, as desired. We also demonstrate how models with specific nonadditive beliefs can easily be derived through bespoke formulations of betting consistency.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>Tending to the Particular: Navigating Tensions Around Principles of Alternativity Through an Ethics of Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alternative organizations must continuously address conflicts that emerge regarding diverging prioritizations and interpretations of autonomy, solidarity, and responsibility. We explore how tensions around alternative moral principles can be navigated through relational processes that attune to others' needs, emotions, and concerns. Building on an organizational ethnography of a cooperative campaign agency, we mobilize ethics of care as a research lens to trace and analyse how relational activities that are infused by an ethical attention to particular others assist the organization in dealing with these tensions. Our findings show that three relational activities – inquiring, deliberating, and responding – constitute a “relational tension‐navigation circuit” that enables the alternative organization to evoke, map, and situatively settle tensions around alternative principles by embracing the vulnerability, plurality, and flourishing of others. We contribute to relational, ethical, and processual research in alternative organizing by showing how the particular and the general can be productively enfolded in alternative organizations. Furthermore, we conceptualize a broad, ethically and relationally grounded understanding of revisability that supports alternative organizations in finding targeted adaptations and provisional solutions to address conflicts and tensions.</content>

    <title>When do Firms with New CEOs Engage in M&amp;amp;A? Understanding the Timing of New CEOs' First M&amp;amp;A Announcements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New CEO appointments can create strategic uncertainty for stakeholders, potentially undermining the CEO's position. While the stakeholder uncertainty perspective suggests CEOs may act boldly to clarify their strategic intentions during early tenure, the CEO life cycle perspective proposes that CEOs avoid such moves during early tenure, as they still need to learn. This study integrates these views to examine whether and when new CEOs under high strategic uncertainty make bold strategic choices during early tenure. Focusing on first acquisitions – especially large and cross‐border deals – we argue that new CEOs have a higher hazard of announcing an acquisition under high strategic uncertainty, namely, outsider CEOs and those whose appointments were more negatively received. Leveraging the time CEOs spend in their role as a conceptual bridge between the two perspectives, we argue that the acquisition hazard under high strategic uncertainty increases over early tenure, as CEOs gather information and learn. Analysing 873 new US CEOs (2004–2020) with an extended Cox hazard model, we find a generally higher hazard of first acquisition announcements for outsider CEOs and those with more negative appointment reactions, especially for bolder deals. Evidence on time dependence is mixed, but more pronounced for outsider CEOs and large acquisitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose CTREND, a new trend factor for cryptocurrency returns, which aggregates price and volume information across different time horizons. Using data on more than 3,000 coins, we employ machine learning methods to exploit information from various technical indicators. The resulting signal reliably predicts cryptocurrency returns. The effect cannot be subsumed by known factors and remains robust across different subperiods, market states, and alternative research designs. Moreover, it survives the impact of transaction costs and persists in big and liquid coins. Finally, an asset pricing model that incorporates CTREND outperforms competing factor models, providing a superior explanation of cryptocurrency returns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates (1) whether misreporting by corporate executives impacts unethical decision‐making by non‐peers in unrelated reporting tasks, and (2) whether observing various forms of punishment for corporate misreporting deters this spillover effect. Specifically, we examine the deterrent effects of two common forms of punishment (fines or imprisonment) and a novel form of punishment (public shaming). Across two experiments, we find that participants are more likely to misreport performance when exposed to media reports about executives engaging in financial misreporting. This evidence is consistent with executive misreporting leading to unethical decision‐making among non‐peer observers. We also find that participant misreporting is reduced when the media reports the punishments levied against those executives. In further mediation tests, our findings suggest observed punishments for corporate misconduct can influence perceptions of injunctive norms and potentially mitigate spillover in unethical behavior.</content>

    <title>Signaling Quality to Consumers: The Role of Social Media Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly turning to social media marketing to boost product visibility and spread consumer-generated content, which often reveals valuable information about product quality. However, our research shows that this dual role can backfire; heavy spending on social media marketing may no longer help high-quality firms stand out. Instead of investing heavily to reach a broad audience, high-quality firms may do better by cutting back and focusing on targeted niche markets. Furthermore, as consumers become more capable of discerning product quality through social media content, low- and medium-quality firms benefit less from mimicking one another. This creates stronger incentives for lower-quality firms to mimic the high-quality firm, which increases consumer confusion and weakens the quality signal conveyed through investment in social media marketing. These findings help explain the variation in firms’ social media marketing strategies and offer practical guidance on allocating social media budgets more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I document a significant gender gap in entrepreneurs’ access to early-stage equity financing. Using unique administrative data on French startups, I show that this gap is particularly pronounced in male-dominated sectors. Controlling for a comprehensive set of entrepreneur and startup characteristics—including demographics, backgrounds, and motivations—accounts for 42% of the average gender gap. However, in male-dominated sectors, 80% of the gap remains unexplained. Growth-oriented female entrepreneurs rely more heavily on bank loans, substituting equity with debt. Finally, VC-backed female-founded startups outperform their male counterparts in male-dominated sectors. These findings suggest that context-dependent stereotypes influence equity financing decisions. (JEL G24, G41, J16, L26)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do real assets protect against inflation? Stocks’ core inflation betas are negative, while their energy betas are positive. Currencies, commodities, and real estate mostly hedge against energy inflation, but not core inflation. These hedging properties are reflected in the prices of inflation risks: only core inflation carries a negative risk premium, and its magnitude is consistent within and across asset classes, uniquely among macroeconomic risk factors. Energy inflation has become more procyclical and volatile since the 1990s, which helps explain the time-varying correlation between stock and bond returns. A two-sector New Keynesian asset pricing model accounts for these facts quantitatively. (JEL E31, G11, G12)</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Effectiveness of Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Chinese Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global shift from face-to-face instruction to online learning, posing new operational challenges for business schools, particularly in equipping students with quantitative skills essential for the labor market. Leveraging China’s abrupt lockdown policies as a natural experiment, we examine the heterogeneous effects of online education on student academic performance. Using a panel dataset of 15,329 observations from 7,867 undergraduate students across nine Chinese universities over four semesters (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), we compare academic outcomes before and during the transition to online learning. We find that online education led to an average increase of 8 to 11 points in mathematics scores on a 100-point scale during the pandemic. Applying principal component analysis, we identify four key policy measures that capture lockdown stringency: stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, public transportation suspension, and public information campaigns. Stricter stay-at-home orders issued by the government reduce the effectiveness of online learning; however, these negative effects are partially offset by increased parental supervision and reduced external distractions resulting from workplace closures and the suspension of public transportation. Further, online learning is more effective for reasoning-focused courses (e.g., mathematics) than interpretation-focused courses (e.g., English), and the academic benefits of face-to-face peer interactions diminish significantly in online settings relative to offline environments. Our findings offer actionable insights for managing educational delivery during operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of tailoring online curriculum design and support systems to course content and student mobility constraints.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Consistency in Service Delivery: Examining the Effect of Process Standardization on Hospital Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare services provided to patients with similar medical conditions are known to vary. Standardization of healthcare delivery is a relatively new, yet hotly debated approach to address clinical variations. Previous research on process standardization in health service delivery has focused on measuring adherence to established protocols available only for a limited set of medical conditions. We create an alternate construct that quantifies process standardization measured in terms of consistency in services rendered, and apply it in a healthcare context using detailed nonpublic inpatient discharge data from about 35 million inpatient stays at acute care hospitals in California between 2008-2016. We examine the impact of such process standardization on the cost, quality, and variation in quality of care delivered at the hospital, operating unit, and medical condition level. We find that process standardization is associated with reductions in cost per discharge, readmission rate and variation in readmission rates at the hospital level. We also find that the impact of process standardization varies across different operating units and medical conditions, providing cost and quality benefit in majority of cases. We further conduct post-hoc analysis on the degree of process standardization, finding that higher rates of capacity utilization and complexity of patient disease mix is associated with a lower process standardization, while increasing focus and process adherence is associated with an increase in process standardization.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Imperative vs. Linguistic Alignment: Organizations Use Language to Modify Environmental Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Analysis on how organizations and the environment interact starts with the common assumption that mutual understanding and agreement are beneficial for organizations. The process of building such an agreement and the consequences of agreement versus disagreement are an active research topic and one that calls for additional research. We add evidence to this debate by performing a replication of the initial findings on the costs of category spanning. We also introduce the concept of linguistic alignment, defined as the intersection of organizational self-description and environmental understanding of the organization. We specify a measurement strategy for linguistic alignment and test the implications of linguistic alignment of U.S. public firms and securities analysts over the last two decades with a novel embedding alignment technique. We find that firm values are reduced when spanning categories, but linguistic alignment is a better predictor of firm value. In addition to this direct effect, linguistic alignment reduces the value reduction of firms with a multi-industry presence. This means that organizations that can manage their self-presentation to achieve linguistic alignment with external audience analysts to obtain better evaluations.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Science Research Council [SICSS Research Grant] and the National Science Foundation Division of Social and Economic Sciences [Grant SES-1236931].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19341 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimization problems with discrete decisions are nonconvex and thus lack strong duality, which limits the usefulness of tools such as shadow prices. It was shown in Burer (2009) that mixed-binary quadratic programs can be written as completely positive programs, which are convex. We apply this perspective by writing unit commitment in power systems as a completely positive program and then using the dual copositive program and strong duality to design new pricing mechanisms. We show that the mechanisms are revenue-adequate and, under certain conditions, support a market equilibrium. To facilitate implementation, we also employ a cutting plane algorithm for solving copositive programs exactly, which we further speed up via a second-order cone programming approximation. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the potential benefits of the pricing mechanisms and algorithms.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00906 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honest and dishonest behaviors may both diffuse among the members of an organization. Knowing which of the two spreads faster is important because it impacts the extent to which managers will need to resort to other, potentially more costly solutions to curb dishonest behavior. Assessing empirically which of honest behavior or dishonest behavior spreads faster is challenging because this requires field measurements of social relationships and dishonest behavior of individual members, which poses both measurement and inference problems. We examine an original fine-grained data set from a large company that allows for identifying agents likely to be dishonest and interactions among employees while offering a natural experiment that circumvents the inference problems associated with identifying peer-to-peer diffusion. We find (1) that dishonest behavior diffuses, whereas honest behavior does not; (2) that diffusion likely operates through spreading information about opportunities for collusion; and (3) that policies that screen on dishonesty at hiring may be efficient to curb dishonest behavior in environments with high turnover.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an era of escalating disruptions—from pandemics to economic crises—organizational resilience is vital for survival and growth. This study offers actionable insights for business leaders and policymakers on strategically leveraging information technology (IT) resources and leadership structures to navigate major shocks. We demonstrate that although diverse IT portfolios (e.g., cloud systems, data analytics tools) can enhance resilience by enabling adaptability, balance is key: moderate IT diversity strengthens resilience, but excessive diversity creates coordination complexities that erode it. Crucially, empowering IT leaders with formal decision-making authority helps firms maximize IT flexibility, shifting this tipping point to harness greater IT diversity without compromising coordination. Our analysis of firms during the pandemic reveals that crisis-induced industry turbulence further shapes these dynamics. Adverse turbulence intensifies the risks of overdiversification, requiring tighter alignment between IT strategies and leadership oversight. Conversely, beneficial turbulence allows firms to experiment with IT resources more freely. Policymakers can support businesses by fostering digital infrastructure, incentivizing IT leadership training, and creating frameworks for public-private data sharing during emergencies. By aligning IT flexibility with coordinated execution, firms can turn crises into opportunities for sustained success. This research equips stakeholders with evidence-based strategies to future-proof operations in an unpredictable world.</content>

    <title>Rent Extraction Amid Borrowers’ Adversity: Evidence from Activist Short Sellers’ Attacks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Finance theory suggests that the privileged information that traditional banks obtain about borrowers through monitoring creates opportunities for banks to impose informational hold-up costs on such borrowers. Because a surge in borrower risk increases banks’ hold-up power, banks with information monopoly should be able to increase their rates beyond the level explained by borrower risk alone. We test this theory using the setting of activist short sellers’ public allegations—a setting that increases borrower risk and restricts borrower access to public financing sources—and find, on average, that, after controlling for both ex ante and ex post changes in borrower credit risk, banks increase loan pricing following activist short sellers’ allegations. Our loan pricing results not explained by changes in borrower credit risk are consistent with banks extorting borrowers during times of adversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel dataset that provides a comprehensive coverage of U.S. firms' industrial supply chain relationships, we find that firms with innovation specific to a buyer are more likely to share a common director with that buyer. This association is stronger when the buyer has a larger number of alternative suppliers. We further find that when a supplier–buyer pair shares a common director, the supplier's R&amp;D investment is more sensitive to the investment opportunities of its buyer. Moreover, such pairs tend to have longer supply chain relationships. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that board ties serve as a credible commitment mechanism to support exchange along the supply chain and safeguard suppliers' buyer‐specific investments.Managerial SummaryOur research shows that suppliers who create products or technologies tailored to a specific buyer are more likely to share a board member with that buyer. This relationship is stronger when the buyer has many other suppliers. Shared board members facilitate better communication and alignment between suppliers and buyers, leading to more effective R&amp;D investments and longer‐lasting business relationships. These ties help reduce the risk for suppliers when investing in customized solutions. For business leaders, strategically leveraging board connections can strengthen supply chain partnerships, promote collaborative innovation, and safeguard investments in buyer‐specific technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While prior research has examined organizational‐ and CEO‐level antecedents to mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) capabilities, less is known about how those below the CEO may shape the ways in which firms conduct acquisitions. In this study, I argue that Corporate Development Executives (CDEs), the specialized executives who lead M&amp;A efforts inside companies, also play an important role in the M&amp;A process. Through a hand‐collected dataset on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 information technology (IT) firms, I find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between their prior M&amp;A experience and subsequent M&amp;A performance, and I document the conditions under which CDEs' M&amp;A experience may complement or substitute that of the CEO and the firm. This study contributes to corporate strategy and organizational learning literatures by unveiling novel insights on the microfoundations of M&amp;A capabilities.Managerial SummaryCorporate Development Executives (CDEs) have become increasingly prevalent across organizations, yet their impact on M&amp;A outcomes remains less understood. This study investigates how these specialized executives responsible for leading M&amp;A inside organizations influence acquisition outcomes through their prior experience. Using detailed data on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 IT firms, I find an inverted‐U relationship between CDEs' prior M&amp;A experience and M&amp;A performance, and that their abilities to shape M&amp;A outcomes can be further enhanced or limited, depending on the experiences of the CEO and the firm. By unpacking the interactions among these different M&amp;A experiences, this work offers important managerial implications on how firms should select and manage their M&amp;A human capital as they continue to build M&amp;A capabilities in pursuit of superior firm performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using signaling theory, this research examines the role that social support during pregnancy plays in reducing work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave. Specifically, we consider four sources of social support (two from the work domain: supervisor and coworkers; and two from the non-work domain: spouse and friends) and the signaling effect they have on a mother’s work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave and her subsequent job and family satisfaction. Based on a sample of 247 women who completed surveys both before taking maternity leave and upon returning to the workforce, we found that supervisor, coworker, and friend support enhanced job satisfaction through reduced work-induced guilt. Further, both supervisor and spouse support contributed to family satisfaction through reduced family-induced guilt. Spouse support reduced family-induced guilt significantly more than coworker support, offering some modest support for domain specificity. Further, when considering the interaction of within-domain effects, we found that the work domain sources of support interact to provide a stronger effect on job satisfaction, but the non-work domain sources do not interact significantly. This provides an enlightening look at social support’s different roles in working mom guilt during a pivotal time in a woman’s life, her return to work after childbirth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market. (JEL G11, G12, G17)</content>

    <title>Capital Requirements with Non-Bank Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I quantitatively analyze the macroeconomic impacts of raising capital requirements in a model in which heterogeneous firms may choose either intermediated or direct finance. Heterogeneous banks compete with other banks and the bond market, fund loans with insured deposits and costly equity (subject to a minimum capital to asset ratio), and monitor borrowers. I find that tighter capital requirements reduce costly bank failures while having only small effects on key macroeconomic aggregates, and that raising capital requirements above current levels can be welfare-improving. Three main forces give rise to these results. First, even though banks cut loan supply for a given level of net worth under a tighter capital requirement, in equilibrium banks’ net worth rises to dampen this effect. Second, intense competition from the non-bank sector disciplines banks’ lending responses to tighter regulation. Third, substitution by corporate firms offsets much of the decline in debt financing associated with tighter bank loan supply. As a corollary, almost all of the modest costs associated with tighter capital requirements are concentrated within the bank-dependent non-corporate sector.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Introducing a new measure of scientific proximity between private firms and public research groups and exploiting a multi-billion euro financing program of academic clusters in France, we provide causal evidence of local spillovers from academic research to firms in the private sector. Our main estimate suggests that each euro spent in academic research through this program spurred an additional 0.81 euros in private R&amp;D expenditures. We also show that this shock increased the average quality of patents. We exploit reports produced by funded clusters, complemented by data on firm creation, labor mobility and R&amp;D public–private partnerships, to provide evidence on the channels for these spillovers. We discuss the policy implications of funding academic research to stimulate private R&amp;D.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some Bilinear Optimization Problems Are Surprisingly Easy to SolveBilinear terms in a continuous optimization problem are computationally challenging and are typically addressed with global optimization techniques or McCormick-based relaxations. In “Hidden convexity in a class of optimization problems with bilinear terms,” Gorissen, den Hertog, and Reusken discover a reformulation technique that provides an equivalent convex formulation that is solvable in polynomial time for a rich subclass of problems. The subclass is characterized by products of variables where one variable is nonnegative and the other variable interacts only with variables that are multiplied with the same nonnegative variable. Their finding provides a new avenue to efficiently solve inverse optimization problems, nonlinear robust optimization problems via their dual problem, and problems with variable coefficients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how variations in nonfinancial terms across bonds from the same issuer, referred to as “issuer term variability” (ITV), relate to bond yield spreads, returns, and investor bases. Our findings show that ITV is positively associated with yield spreads, even after accounting for the issuer’s credit ratings and other credit risk proxies. Additionally, bonds with high ITV exhibit greater default risk but deliver lower risk-adjusted returns compared with those with low ITV. We also find that yield-seeking investors are more likely to own bonds with high ITV, and bond funds that reach for yield also tend to favor high ITV bonds. These results suggest that some investors specifically target high ITV bonds to achieve higher yields, even at the cost of lower returns. Further analysis indicates that reaching for ITV is difficult to justify as rational risk-taking by constrained investors.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01876 .</content>

    <title>Learning to Price Supply Chain Contracts Against a Learning Retailer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of big data analytics has automated the decision-making of companies and increased supply chain agility. In this paper, we study the supply chain contract design problem faced by a data-driven supplier (she) who needs to respond to the inventory decisions of the downstream retailer (he). Both the supplier and the retailer are uncertain about the market demand and need to learn about it sequentially over a fixed time horizon. In addition, the supplier does not know the retailer’s inventory learning policy, which may change dynamically. The goal for the supplier is to develop data-driven pricing policies with sublinear regret bounds under a wide range of possible retailer inventory learning policies. To capture the dynamics induced by the retailer’s inventory learning policy, we establish a connection with nonstationary online learning by following the notion of a variation budget. We start by making the observation that existing approaches for nonstationary online learning cannot precisely delineate the dynamics incurred by the retailer’s inventory learning policy, and may lead to linear growth in the supplier’s regret under some well-known retailer inventory learning policies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new notion of variation budget, which better quantifies the impact of the retailer’s learning on the supplier’s decision-making environment. We also demonstrate the advantages of our new model for the variation budget in our setting over those in the existing literature. We then proceed to propose dynamic pricing policies for the supplier for both discrete and continuous demand distributions. Our pricing policies lead to sublinear regret bounds for the supplier under a wide range of retailer inventory learning policies. Our pricing policies empirically outperform those from the existing nonstationary online learning literature. At the managerial level, we answer affirmatively that there is a pricing policy with a sublinear regret bound for the supplier under a wide range of retailer inventory learning policies, even though she faces a learning retailer and an unknown demand distribution. Our work also provides a novel perspective in data-driven operations management where the principal has to learn to react to the learning policies employed by other agents in the system.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03339 .</content>

    <title>A Method for Asynchronous Time Series Analysis with Marketing Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many time series data evolve asynchronously. In marketing, for example, we observe ad liking every second, hourly clickstreams, daily sales, weekly brand awareness, or monthly ad expenditures. Thus, the question arises: how to estimate dynamic models when metrics evolve at different frequencies? To this end, we develop a new method for estimation and inference of state space models for asynchronous data. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed method does not require any data preprocessing to align frequencies. We derive the optimal gain factor from first principles and demonstrate in three simulation studies that the new method recovers model parameters as accurately as the full-information Kalman filter as if all data were available. This finding holds across various degrees of noise levels and data sparsity. More importantly, we show that ignoring data asynchronicity results in substantially biased parameter estimates. Empirically, we illustrate the efficacy of the new method via two applications: copy testing of an advertisement and a marketing mix model, both with asynchronous data. It yields meaningful results compared with those obtained by aligning asynchronous data to the slowest frequency (i.e., data aggregation). In the marketing mix application, for example, data aggregation produces erroneously insignificant estimates of sales carryover and TV effectiveness, and these become significant when we apply the new method. These biased estimates can have serious managerial consequences. Thus, the proposed method paves the way to analyze asynchronous time series data: slow- or fast-moving dependent variables, slow- or fast-moving independent variables, and all of them at equal or unequal frequencies.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Marketing Science Institute [Grant 4-1959].

    <title>Dynamic Control of a Make-to-Order System Under Model Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deriving control policies for a make-to-order manufacturing system is often predicated on a well-specified probabilistic model that governs demand realization. In practice, however, such a model may be a simplification of the actual scenario because of tractability considerations. Consequently, policies obtained under such simplifications may perform poorly if the assumed model does not accurately capture reality. In this paper, we propose a modeling paradigm that can generate control policies based on a simplified model, accounting for possible model errors that may result. The make-to-order system offers multiple products and has an outsourcing mechanism. Our focus is on addressing deliberate model simplification for the demand realization process. We formulate a robust control problem that takes the form of a two-player, zero-sum game. Because the original formulation is not tractable enough, we further develop an approximating problem under the heavy-traffic assumption that effectively results in a stochastic differential game. The solution to this game then translates into an implementable control policy for the original make-to-order system. We supplement the proposed modeling paradigm with a simulation-based method for selecting an appropriate uncertainty set. Numerical experiments expose, among other things, the value of building robustness into decision making.This paper was accepted by Barış Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the spread of misinformation on centralized social media platforms has received significant attention, few studies compare centralized and decentralized platforms, and how to mitigate misinformation diffusion in newly emerging blockchain‐based decentralized social network platforms. We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent‐based simulations leveraging real‐world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measured as yield spreads against Treasury securities and AAA corporate bonds, the convenience premium of newly issued agency MBS averages more than half of the long-term Treasury convenience premium. The agency MBS convenience premium and issuance amount vary negatively with mortgage rate, consistent with a prepayment-driven channel. Placing agencies into conservatorship in 2008 and introducing liquidity regulations in 2013 significantly affected MBS convenience premium, consistent with government guarantee and regulatory treatment channels. Analyses of dispersion of dealers’ prepayment forecasts, seasoned MBS, and investors’ MBS holdings deliver further economic implications for agency MBS as safe assets.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate investors’ disagreement regarding firm news and assess its ability to predict stock returns. Specifically, we quantify firm-level investor disagreement through the volume-volatility elasticity surrounding firm news; higher elasticity is associated with less investor disagreement. Intuitively, disagreement introduces additional trading motives that are not driven by price changes, weakening the connection between volume and volatility. Our findings indicate that investor disagreement on news negatively predicts cross-sectional returns. We also present empirical evidence aligned with the theoretical predictions of a recently developed model by Atmaz and Basak (Journal of Finance 73 (3): 1225–1279 2018) that the negative disagreement-stock relation strengthens when the optimism effect dominates the uncertainty effect. Importantly, this predictive relationship remains robust after controlling for news heterogeneity, other volume- and volatility-based measures, and alternative channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how global changes in information acquisition costs through disclosure technologies affect price informativeness. To explore this issue, we examine worldwide adoptions of centralized electronic disclosure systems, which significantly reduce the cost of and broaden access to financial disclosures. Consistent with theory, we show a significant reduction in private information acquisition around earnings announcements as a result of these adoptions. These effects are most pronounced in countries with the most substantial reductions in information acquisition costs and where we find more significant decreases in informed trade. Overall, we highlight an important, unintended cost of broadening access to financial disclosures through technology adoptions.</content>

    <title>Distributional Growth Accounting: Education and the Reduction of Global Poverty, 1980-2019</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the role played by education in the reduction of global poverty. I propose tools for identifying the contribution of schooling to economic growth by income group, integrating imperfect substitution between skill groups into macroeconomic growth decomposition. I bring this “distributional growth accounting” framework to the data by exploiting a new microdatabase representative of nearly all of the world’s population, new estimates of the private returns to schooling, and historical income distribution statistics. Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education. Because they ignore the distributional effects of schooling, standard growth accounting methods substantially underestimate economic benefits of education for the global poor.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To realize complementary value in ecosystems, organizations engage in architectural learning, which involves searching for interdependencies and specifying interactions with external complements. In this article, we explore how this process differs when potential complements are not yet fully interoperable and complementarity is emergent. We report on a longitudinal case study of a 3D printer company that shifted from producing inexpensive personal desktop 3D printers to the professional 3D printing ecosystem. The company intensively used proxies (stand-in components) to support learning about interdependencies with potential external complements. This process informed internal component adaptations and the design of boundary resources that enabled third-party complementors to make their components fully complementary. From this case, we theorize this process in terms of shaping a complementarity space: a problem space in which organizations iteratively draw on proxies to provide resources such as interfaces and tools to transfer complementary capabilities to other organizations. We discuss theoretical implications for research on architectural learning and ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multilocation, Dynamic Staff Planning for a Healthcare System: Methodology and ApplicationThis study develops and implements a robust optimization model for dynamically assigning anesthesiologists across multiple hospitals in a large health system. The model addresses uncertainty in surgical demand by incorporating a three-stage decision process: presurgical location assignments, midhorizon on-call deployment, and day-of realization of overtime or idleness. The authors formulate the problem as a multistage robust mixed-integer program and solve it efficiently using a novel nested column and constraint generation algorithm. The approach accounts for location-specific constraints and fairness in on-call duties using historical data to estimate demand uncertainty with a calibrated trade-off between optimality and robustness. Implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the model reduced annual staffing costs by 12% or roughly $800,000 compared to existing practice. The framework is generalizable to other staffing problems in healthcare and provides operational insights on the value of forecast accuracy, location flexibility, and equitable workload distribution.</content>

    <title>Eliciting Advice Instead of Feedback Improves Developmental Input</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most organizations encourage employees to provide feedback to one another to support learning, personal growth, and career advancement. However, employee feedback often fails to improve performance because it lacks concrete, specific guidance. We provide a temporal explanation for why workplace input processes routinely fail to produce valuable and concrete developmental insights: they are insufficiently focused on the future. In this paper, we theorize and demonstrate that encouraging input providers to think about the future leads them to produce more concrete developmental input. Across a large scale, preregistered field experiment (n = 27,432 comments) and two laboratory studies (n = 806), people provide more concrete and actionable developmental input when they are prompted to provide future-looking “advice” rather than “feedback,” a common method of soliciting input in organizations. The effect of soliciting advice on input concreteness was mediated by providers’ future focus. Moreover, in a follow-up study, such concrete input was assessed by independent raters as more useful. These findings highlight the role of temporal orientation in driving the content of developmental input. In doing so, our data suggest that individuals and organizations have the potential to promote higher-quality developmental input by attending to the temporal orientation that their input systems encourage.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: Funding for the laboratory experiments was provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03207 .</content>

    <title>Reducing Racial Disparities in Consumer Credit: Evidence from Anonymous Loan Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a unique experiment of anonymizing online loan applications to test whether race-blind screening procedures reduce racial disparities in consumer credit. With names on applications, minority applicants are 10% less likely to receive online loan offers and receive worse offer terms than otherwise identical majority applicants. Anonymizing applications reduces such disparities substantially. High-income minority applicants benefit more than low-income minorities. We show that the racial disparities are not driven by differences in credit demand. Overall, anonymous loan applications reduce racial disparities in access to credit by increasing lender reliance on objective credit risk measures.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This research is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its Social Science Research Thematic Grant [Grant MOE2019-SSRTG-024].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the roles of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists (VCs), and the government in financing fundamental innovations, defined as those with a positive social value net of development costs but often with negative net present values to innovating firms, for example, a vaccine against COVID-19. We first analyze the case where the entrepreneur, with or without VC financing, develops innovations. We then analyze government support of innovation and the government’s choice between subsidies and innovation prizes. We further analyze the optimal interactions between government and VC financing, showing that the government may optimally channel subsidies partially through VCs, thus rationalizing government-funded VCs. Overall, our paper provides a framework for the optimal choice of sectors and technologies to receive government support (e.g., subsidies included in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022) and how any government support should be structured to best motivate innovation.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a second-price auction with a flexible reserve price, where the reserve price for the top bidder is not fixed but rather determined as a function of all losing bids. We show that when bidders are ex ante heterogeneous, a second-price auction with an optimally chosen flexible reserve price not only generates strictly higher expected revenue than that of a second-price auction with any fixed reserve price but is also revenue-maximizing among all mechanisms that implement discrimination-free social choice functions. We also provide an axiomatic characterization of all second-price auctions with a flexible reserve price. Finally, we discuss real-life implementation.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Oesterreichische Nationalbank [Grant 19021] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72203148].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04584 .</content>

    <title>Too Good To Go: Combating Food Waste with Surprise Clearance</title>
    <updated>2025-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies surprise clearance as an innovative business model to increase store profit and reduce food waste. A store holding surprise clearance sells “surprise bags” composed of surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. At the time of ordering, consumers are uncertain about the quantity of food items included in a surprise bag. We model surprise clearance and compare it with both no clearance and transparent clearance, which sets a transparent unit clearance price based on the amount of surplus food after regular sales. We find that surprise clearance achieves the highest store profit and induces the most store production among the three selling schemes. Although both clearance schemes have the ability to eliminate store waste, the store effectively does so under surprise clearance but deliberately does not under transparent clearance. In fact, transparent clearance may generate even more store waste than no clearance. Further, both clearance schemes exacerbate the problem of consumer waste compared with no clearance, and despite zero store waste, surprise clearance generates the most consumer waste among the three schemes. If clearance sales target a consumer segment with a sufficiently low valuation of consumption, both clearance schemes reduce total waste, and surprise clearance is a win-win-win solution that maximizes store profit and social welfare and minimizes total waste among the three schemes. However, there are circumstances under which both clearance schemes fail to reduce total waste, and surprise clearance may generate the most total waste.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: L.

    <title>Setting the Stage: Line Managers' &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Orientation as an Antecedent to Perceived &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The field of strategic human resource (HR) management has shown an increasing focus on how employees perceive and react to their organization's HR practices. In this perspective, employees are not passive recipients of HR policies or mere observers of their managers' HR implementation strategies. Rather, their perceptions play a critical role in shaping organizational culture and fostering high‐performing workplaces. However, important questions remain regarding how line management roles shape not only employees' assessments of their work environment but also their perceptions of HR effectiveness. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, we argue that line managers' compliance‐ versus commitment‐focused orientations influence employee appraisals of threats and challenges in their jobs. These appraisals, in turn, shape how employees evaluate the effectiveness of their organization's HR practices (i.e., perceived HR effectiveness). Using qualitative data from focus groups and a multilevel quantitative research design, we find evidence supporting our hypotheses, showing that line managers' HR orientations significantly influence employees' cognitive appraisals and subsequent perceptions of HR effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical contributions and offering practical recommendations for improving the implementation of HR practices.</content>

    <title>Does Tax-Benefit Linkage Matter for the Incidence of Payroll Taxes?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze earnings responses to six large payroll tax and income tax reforms in France. Our findings indicate full pass-through to workers when there is a strong and transparent link between contributions and expected benefits. In contrast, employer payroll taxes with no tax-benefit linkage exhibit limited pass-through to workers, while income tax nominally borne by employees show nearly full pass-through. Together with a meta-analysis of the literature, we interpret these results as empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that tax-benefit linkage matters for the incidence of payroll taxes. In the absence of such linkage, our findings suggest that the individual-level incidence of payroll taxes aligns with their statutory incidence.</content>

    <title>Virtually Even: Status Equalizing in Distributed Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In distributed organizations, perceived status differences between workers are ubiquitous and harmful. Yet research suggests that once they are formed, status beliefs in organizations become entrenched in hierarchies and are hard to dismantle. In an inductive qualitative study, we observed how established status differences between remote and in-person workers in distributed organizations dissolved during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone began working remotely. We use these data to theorize a novel status-equalizing process through which remote workers came to see themselves on an “equal playing field” with their in-person peers. We theorize how this status equalizing occurred through workers’ changing their “in-person default” use of technology—that is, their new behavior challenged embedded cultural practices that had treated the in-person workplace experience as the standard, normal, and valued perspective, implicitly guiding how employees used technology. Workers adopted new and more inclusive technology practices—including the use of asynchronous communication, greater codification of work, and virtual socializing—which resulted in remote workers perceiving new and more equal communication standards, access to information, and opportunity for social connection. As a result, these workers reported feeling less negatively stereotyped and treated more fairly in their virtual interactions with colleagues, fostering feelings of inclusion and deepening relationships across the previously established status divide. At a time when many organizations are grappling with the challenges of distributed, remote, and hybrid work, our research illuminates how inclusive technology practices can help nullify entrenched status imbalances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bayesian Learning for Data-Driven Stochastic Optimal ControlStochastic optimal control (SOC) provides a principled approach to dynamic decision making under uncertainty. It models the transition of the system state with a dynamic equation driven by randomness, with the assumption that the distribution of randomness is known. However, in practical problems, modeling randomness frequently depends on data or observations, which introduces uncertainty regarding the distribution of randomness. To address the data-driven SOC problem, in “Episodic Bayesian Optimal Control with Unknown Randomness Distributions,” Shapiro, Zhou, Lin, and Wang propose a new approach that incorporates Bayesian learning with optimal control in an episodic manner. They show the convergence and convergence rate results for their approach. They also develop an efficient computational method for a class of problems that have convex cost functions and linear state dynamics.</content>

    <title>Closer to Home: A Structural Estimate-Then-Optimize Approach to Improve Access to Healthcare Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geographic inequalities in healthcare access extend beyond rural–urban divides to include socioeconomic, racial, and other disparities. Proximity to hospitals, clinics, healthcare providers, and pharmacies varies widely, posing a challenge in deciding where to strategically locate such facilities. Demand for each service depends on local population health, individual preferences, provider capacity, and other factors. This study introduces a novel structural estimate-then-optimize (SETO) framework, combining structural demand estimation using a modified Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes approach that accounts for provider capacity with a choice-based optimal facility location model to maximize health service utilization. Our methodology is illustrated with a case study on the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program in California, a public–private partnership that administered millions of COVID-19 vaccinations. Demand estimates indicate that residents of socioeconomically vulnerable communities are more sensitive to travel distances to pharmacy-based vaccination sites. Strategically adding 500 retail stores serving lower-income communities increases predicted vaccinations by 2.9% overall (770,000 additional vaccinations statewide) and by 5.3% in the least healthy neighborhoods. Our integrative SETO approach outperforms heuristics that allocate resources based on current vaccination rates, existing service gaps, population density, or predicted demand. The case study demonstrates the importance of (1) accounting for heterogeneity in estimating demand and (2) selecting partnerships to complement existing networks with spatially heterogeneous supply and efficiently fill service gaps. Our study provides a systematic approach to optimize healthcare delivery networks, using publicly available aggregate data while accounting for individuals’ preferences, highlighting the value of combining a structural demand model with prescriptive analytics.This paper was accepted by Stefan Sholtes, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06274 .</content>

    <title>Unbottling Time: Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty and ‘Time‐Less Organizing’ at a Bottled Water Plant Occupation in Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how Indigenous Zapatista‐influenced activists enact temporal sovereignty to resist corporate water extraction, challenging dominant Western organizational temporalities. Through qualitative in‐person research of the 2021 occupation of a water bottling plant in Mexico, I explore how activists transformed the site into a non‐capitalist communal space, creating alternative temporal rhythms rooted in Zapatista principles such as ‘walking at the pace of the slowest’ and collective autonomy. The findings reveal how activists rejected efficiency‐driven deadlines, prioritized ecological cycles over productivity metrics, and fostered relational well‐being through inclusive decision‐making. These practices culminated in what I conceptualize as ‘time‐less organizing’ – a framework for non‐capitalist horizontal organizing that operates outside conventional time logics. The study contributes to the management and organizing literature by theorizing temporal sovereignty as resistance to imposed temporalities, extending critiques of stakeholder theory by exposing how corporate temporal constraints perpetuate marginalization, and demonstrating how communities reclaim autonomy through alternative temporal practices. The findings challenge assumptions of time as a resource to be managed for efficiency gains, offering future avenues of research for addressing grand challenges through decelerated and relational approaches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We note that while the institutional environment determines the actions and structures of constituent organizations, there are still limited insights available in the literature on the nature and process of interactions between key stakeholders in ambulance services, especially as they respond during a significant crisis. This study specifically examines how a positive social exchange between senior leadership, managers, and frontline staff, accompanied by changes to the leadership style and HR practices, resulted in significant service transformation. An in‐depth qualitative case study design was used to interview 52 frontline staff and leaders from the UK National Health Service's (NHS) Ambulance Service over a prolonged period of 8 months (October 2020 to May 2021). Interviews and secondary data were abductively analyzed, showing how changes to HRM and leadership practices shaped service transformation's content, process, and logic. The findings suggest that an iterative social exchange between the key social actors in the Ambulance Trust led to adaptations to the nature of HRM and leadership practices, which positively impacted the changes to service delivery, leading to service transformation and improved health and well‐being of paramedics. Our conceptual framework contributes to the literature by integrating how the use of agency, new HRM, and leadership practices in the context of institutionalized structures can result in service transformation. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational socialization and the practice of onboarding new hires are central human resources functions. However, traditional socialization theory and practice were built on assumptions that are increasingly misaligned with today's work context. We identified four current, emerging, and future work trends that characterize the evolving landscape surrounding organizational socialization: technological advancement, the expansion of remote work arrangements, rising societal loneliness and mental health challenges, and aging workforce demographics. Collectively, these trends have contributed to dramatic shifts in the context and performance of work, as well as the expectations that employees and organizations hold for one another. Accordingly, we argue that these shifts require a renewed examination of the organizational socialization process that reflects contemporary realities such as the move away from stable, physically co‐located, psychologically anchored work toward boundaryless, tech‐mediated, and transient work arrangements. Our review presents a future‐forward look at organizational socialization through the lens of these societal and workplace shifts. We identify newcomer adaptability and connection as emergent critical factors for the future of onboarding. Through this lens, we offer practical implications for human resource practice and invite future research that advances our understanding of organizational socialization in today's context.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unemployment differentials are greater between countries in the euro area than between U.S. states. In both regions, net migration responds to unemployment differentials, though the response is smaller in the euro area compared to the United States. We use a multi-country DSGE model with cross-border migration to quantify Mundell’s hypothesis that labor mobility could substitute for independent monetary policy in a currency union. While not as effective as independent monetary policy, increased labor mobility reduces business cycle fluctuations for most countries in the euro area. However, Mundell’s conjecture does not hold uniformly. For countries that primarily face demand shocks, labor mobility stabilizes inflation and unemployment and improves welfare. If supply shocks are dominant however, labor mobility increases the cost of being in a currency union by magnifying inflation volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate executives often use metaphors, particularly those derived from war imagery, when communicating their strategic intentions. This study examines the influence of metaphorical framing in corporate communication, particularly its effect on analyst reactions to firms’ acquisition announcements. We theorize and analyze the impact of metaphor families that either emphasize or downplay competition while considering the diverse source domains from which these metaphors originate. We propose a theoretical framework that integrates conceptual metaphor theory with the risk-as-feelings perspective, suggesting that certain metaphors can evoke visceral perceptions of danger. Our findings reveal that using metaphors in acquisition announcements generally elicits negative reactions. Notably, metaphors from the competition family, especially war-related ones signifying competitive aggression, evoke stronger adverse reactions. The detrimental impact of war language substantially diminishes in contexts where aggressive competition is expected. We contribute to strategic communication research by highlighting the contingent influence of metaphorical framing on audience reactions, emphasizing the importance of metaphor families, source domains, and contextual factors.Funding: J.

    <title>Fat Tails in Human Judgment: Empirical Evidence and Implications for the Aggregation of Estimates and Forecasts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How frequent are large disagreements in human judgment? The substantial literature relating to expert assessments of real-valued quantities and their aggregation almost universally assumes that judgment errors follow a jointly normal distribution. We investigate this question empirically using 73 data sets from four different sources that include over 169,000 estimates and forecasts. We find incontrovertible evidence for excess kurtosis: that is, of fat tails. Despite the diversity of the analyzed data, varying in how much uncertainty there is in the quantity being assessed and varying in the level of expertise and of sophistication of those making the assessments, we find surprising consistency in the frequency with which an individual judgment is in large disagreement with the consensus. Fitting a generalized normal distribution to the data, we find most estimates for the shape parameter to be between 0.9 and 1.6 (where 1 is the double-exponential distribution and 2 is the normal distribution). This has important implications, in particular for the aggregation of expert estimates and forecasts and for the construction of confidence intervals. We describe optimal Bayesian aggregation with fat tails and propose a simple average-median average heuristic that performs well for the range of empirically observed distributions.This paper was accepted by Manuel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04006 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The perils of legitimacy threats for CBAs are widely acknowledged in the literature. However, prior research has focused on legitimacy threats stemming from factors not in the direct control of MNEs. In this study, we explore if and how acquirers’ CSI salience, a legitimacy threat stemming directly from the past actions and behaviors of the focal firm, influences a critical international expansion decision—the level of ownership obtained in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs). Drawing on neo-institutional theory, we argue that CSI salience reduces the level of ownership obtained in CBAs as it captures more stakeholder attention and is factored into their legitimacy evaluations. In addition, we examine how characteristics of the host country’s legitimating environment may attenuate or accentuate the legitimacy threat from CSI as they reflect how host country stakeholders notice, assess, and respond to CSI and the capacity of host institutions to monitor and enforce compliance. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 16,650 CBAs by 10,738 unique acquirers, and offer valuable insights into the interplay of CSI salience, legitimacy, and CBA ownership to research and practice.</content>

    <title>Why Bonuses Promote Deviant Behaviors: A Self‐Determination Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bonuses are notoriously used to motivate workers. How effective are they at doing so, and might there be unintended consequences? We investigated the effectiveness of bonuses based on game profitability on the motivation of video game developers by examining specific bonus characteristics that align with advice derived from expectancy theory. We also investigated if bonuses encouraged or discouraged moral engagement and corner‐cutting behavior through their effects on work motivation as conceptualized through self‐determination theory. Company data on bonus characteristics coupled with surveys from 1024 game developers in a video game company indicated that the size of the last received bonus did not influence current work motivation. Uncertain probability of getting the next bonus installment was related to a lack of motivation, while more certain probability was related to higher intrinsic motivation. The probable size of the next bonus was related to lower external regulation and to higher intrinsic motivation, contrary to predictions from most motivation theories. Both probability certainty and bonus size probability were indirectly negatively associated with moral disengagement and corner‐cutting behaviors via decreasing amotivation and external regulation. Overall, results show that the bonus system in this company had limited effects on motivation and on discouraging deviant behaviors and point to how such systems can be improved using advice from theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain comprising a downstream retailer and multiple complementary suppliers. Suppliers can form coalitions to jointly invest in sustainable production technologies and enhance the product’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) level. Coalition members benefit from efficiency gains through shared knowledge and information about green production. The retailer sources from these coalitions and sells the product to heterogeneous consumers. We develop a game-theoretical model and use the notion of Nash stability to characterize equilibrium coalition structures and firms’ optimal decisions under three profit allocation rules. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Forming supplier coalitions can benefit all stakeholders (including the retailer, suppliers, and society) but achieving such a win–win–win outcome hinges on two factors: the market’s consciousness rate (i.e., the proportion of socially conscious consumers) and the efficiency gains from coalition formation. (2) The grand coalition that maximizes the retailer’s profit and CSR level is not always stable due to free-riding behaviors. In particular, less efficient suppliers may defect to avoid the cost of sustainable innovation while still benefiting from the high innovation efforts of others (i.e., cross-coalition free-riding). (3) On the supply side, adopting the Shapley value allocation rule exacerbates within-coalition free-riding by assigning greater profit shares to less efficient suppliers. However, it also reduces their incentive to defect, thus enhancing coalition stability. Moreover, greater total efficiency and a smaller efficiency gap among suppliers further improve the stability of the grand coalition. (4) On the demand side, the impact of increasing the market’s consciousness rate is non-monotonic. Improperly influencing consumer awareness may destabilize coalitions and produce unintended consequences, suggesting that the retailer must proceed with caution.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Deep Demand Response Program for Local Electricity Systems</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The decarbonization of power systems facilitates the electrification of appliances, many of which can be operated in a flexible way. Demand response (DR) programs can exploit this flexibility with retail price adjustment, thereby addressing several operational challenges. In this paper, we address the welfare optimization problem of local utilities that procure electricity for their customers at the wholesale market. We demonstrate how DR programs can be designed for local electricity systems where electricity demand and its response to temporary price changes is unknown. For this purpose, we address a novel and complex pricing problem – pricing under unknown, time-interdependent, and discontinuous demand – leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning. Using a numerical case study calibrated on Californian electricity market data, we show that such a “Deep DR program” helps to identify effective prices that improve social welfare. The performance of the program is consistently positive across a variety of system conditions. We further demonstrate that our approach beats Time-of-Use tariff-based benchmarks already after five and a parametric benchmark after 19 simulation days, on average. Second, we provide novel insights regarding an important but frequently overlooked aspect of DR program design: the length of the notification interval, i.e. the timespan for which future prices must be set in advance. We find that the timing of price information is important and that longer notification intervals can improve social welfare. Finally, we provide insights into DR price setting and find that DR prices co-move with wholesale market prices but are lower for longer notification intervals and shorter event sequences. The presented Deep DR program provides an example of how advances in machine learning-based algorithms can help to meet the complex operational requirements of future local electricity systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a two-echelon decentralized supply chain where the probability of selling nondefective products depends on the supplier’s quality improvement and the buyer’s inspection efforts. Products assembled from defective components cause a recall that leads to external failure costs for the buyer. Both players’ efforts are not contractible and it is a challenge to align inspection and quality-improvement efforts in a decentralized supply chain. We find that a procurement contract can provide preventive incentives that induce high inspection efforts and enhancing incentives that enable the supplier to credibly commit to high-quality components. However, these contractual incentives only align two players’ efforts under certain conditions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that introducing a product recall (PR) insurance requirement into a standard procurement contract provided by the buyer can complement enhancing incentives and lead to quality improvement in components. More importantly, as PR insurance can improve the flexibility of risk-sharing arrangements between the supplier and the buyer, we show that it can also serve as a coordinating role in improving the performance of a decentralized supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Warehouse Assortment Selection: Minimizing Order Splitting in E-commerce Logistics</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Order splitting is one of the key issues in the e-commerce order fulfillment process. It increases operational costs, elevates carbon emissions, and compromises customer satisfaction. This paper focuses on determining the product assortments to store within the multi-warehouse logistics network to minimize the total number of split orders subject to cardinality constraints. We show that this minimizing split orders (MSO) problem is NP-hard and demonstrate that even finding an optimal order fulfillment strategy with a given assortment selection is NP-hard. To further analyze the MSO problem, we introduce a concept termedthe second-order dominant indexing rule. This indexing rule corresponds to a group of demand distributions, under which we are able to characterize the structure of the optimal assortment selection for various scenarios. In particular, when assortment overlapping is prohibited, the optimal selection can be explicitly derived. When the demand exhibits a total nested structure, an optimal selection is non-overlapping with more popular products allocated to larger warehouses. We also bridge the two-warehouse order splitting minimization problem with the single-warehouse assortment selection problem in the literature. Building upon this connection, we propose an Extended Marginal Choice Indexing (MCI) policy, which is proven to achieve optimality when the demand has a second-order dominant MCI. In addition, we propose an Iterative Improvement Heuristic that refines any existing assortment selection. The efficiency of the proposed heuristics is validated by extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating that the extended MCI policy performs near-optimally even when customer demand is not ideal, and both heuristics outperform the best benchmark in existing literature. Additional experiments on real-world data further confirm their effectiveness and scalability. Finally, we extend our findings to a two-tier multi-warehouse scenario with a back-end warehouse.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends the canonical harm reduction approach to a wider set of applications, including conservation. We develop an economic model to illustrate the trade-offs inherent to harm reduction, weighing the benefits of reducing harm against the risk of drawing those previously abstaining into consumption, and identify contexts where it is not applicable. Using sequential campaigns with embedded experimentation that enables measurement, we market a harm reduction solution in the context of water conservation. We show that a smart irrigation controller that efficiently maintains stigmatized ornamental landscapes appeals to the heaviest irrigators and generates large and long-lasting individual and social benefits: cost recovery in six months and water savings covering another household’s basic needs. We find no evidence it cannibalizes abstinence (lawn removal) or increases irrigation by conservation-prone individuals. Our conceptual and measurement framework provides a foundation for implementing and evaluating harm reduction well beyond the typical drug and public health contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Experience with a product is shaped by two things: (i) aspects of the product itself and (ii) aspects of the environment in which the product is consumed. This paper documents evidence that when translating their experiences into ratings for products, consumers overly attribute their experience to products, and under-attribute experience to context—the environment in which the product is consumed. First, 218,918 ratings collected from REI.com demonstrate that ratings for cold-weather gear (products designed to keep people warm) are positively correlated with temperature: These products get lower ratings when the weather is cold and higher ratings when the weather is warm, controlling for climate and season. Ratings for other products (e.g., bicycles, tents, skis) are not affected by temperature. This effect generalizes to other products and contexts both in the REI data (e.g., rain jackets and rain) and in a laboratory experiment. The paper also identifies attenuating conditions for this effect. Specifically, the effect seems to be smaller when reviewers explicitly consider context, and when context information is made more accessible, while rating. These findings inform several possible interventions for platforms, which are assessed and validated.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates “growth departments,” an increasingly popular governance structure in modern organizations. Using a multimethod approach across five studies, the authors examine the purpose, responsibilities, and effectiveness of these departments. In Studies 1A and 1B the authors analyze job ads to understand the growth department. Study 2 expands this understanding via interviews with Chief Growth Officers. Findings show that the growth department is a cross-functional unit distinct from marketing and sales departments, designed to unify and orchestrate growth throughout the organization. Studies 3 and 4 assess their impact on firm outcomes, drawing from boundary spanning and organizational ambidexterity theories. In startups, hiring a growth leader results in better advancement through funding rounds, a key proxy of startup growth, than hiring a marketing or sales leader (Study 3). In public firms, a powerful growth department improves performance metrics including Tobin’s Q, cash flow, and ROA (Study 4). The paper also identifies contingency factors influencing the growth department’s effectiveness, including the growth leader’s past sales or marketing experience and the firm’s strategic emphasis on exploration versus exploitation. Together, the findings advance theory and practice by clarifying what growth departments are, how they operate, and under what conditions they enhance firm performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Breaking Up to Move Forward: The Value Gains of Alliance Terminations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior alliance research in marketing has largely focused on factors enhancing alliance stability. Yet also alliance terminations can be valuable. They are intricately linked with firms’ strategies to (re)allocate resources to create financial value. The basic premise of this study is that an alliance termination increases firm value when investors interpret it as the firm’s intention to reallocate resources towards more promising market opportunities. The key question is how investors arrive at that interpretation. The prior literature suggests that the diversity of a firm’s alliance portfolio informs investors about its resource (re)allocation strategy. This argument relies on three assumptions: (1) firms face uncertainty, (2) resources invested in the terminated alliance are redeployable, and (3) the diverse alliance portfolio offers resource reallocation opportunities. These assumptions form the basis for the development of a contingency framework. Moderators are identified to capture (1) firms’ competitive environment and exposure to macroeconomic risk, (2) the fungible nature versus alliance-specificity of resources invested in the terminated alliance, and (3) efficiency and overlap with the other alliances in the portfolio. An event study of 427 firm-alliance termination announcements during 1985-2020 supports the predictions. The combined findings shed new light on alliance terminations, contributing to marketing theory and practice.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Too Painful to Donate: Why Don’t People Donate to Critical Illness Campaigns?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charitable donations are increasingly shifting to online fundraising platforms, where numerous campaigns are displayed simultaneously. This research examines the role of campaign titles in attracting online traffic in this competitive environment, focusing specifically on a major category of medical fundraising. While fundraisers commonly include the names of critical illnesses in campaign titles (critical illness titles), our findings suggest that this emotion-laden driver can negatively impact donation performance. A series of seven studies—combining secondary data, field and controlled experiments—provides robust evidence for this undesirable critical illness title effect. Moreover, three studies offer mediation and moderation evidence showing that anticipated distress drives this effect. Donors tend to avoid critical illness title campaigns, opting instead for alternatives that still allow them to express empathy. However, this effect diminishes when there is a non-distress cue or when the alternatives are non-justifiable. This research contributes to the literature on charitable crowdfunding, prosocial behavior, and title effect, offering important practical implications for fundraisers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: More Ads, More Viewers? Analyzing Behavioral Shifts from Advertising Permissions to Live Streaming Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There has been little exploration on how audience content consumption may change in response to advertising permissions on live streaming platforms. Ads are utilized by brands to generate revenue through ad exposure, but is this benefit thwarted by the reduction of audience consumption of content? Using a dataset containing over 12 million observations in the live streaming space and a difference-in-differences estimation approach, we study the effects of a policy intervention by a live streaming platform which provided (some) streamers the ability to display mid-roll advertisements (MRAs). Although the ad avoidance literature infers that ad-supported content should be viewed unfavorably by audiences, our results indicate that providing the mere ability to introduce MRAs has a notable positive effect on live streaming content consumption (average viewership and total hours watched). We discover that a viable explanation for this response is through increases in broadcasting airtime, stream frequency (somewhat) and quality by streamers after the intervention, as these adjustments are drastically easier to implement in a live streaming setting when compared to more “traditional” forms of media. We further explore heterogeneity in these effects in relation to initial success, streaming tenure, content activity, culture (of the streamer), and impact across time.</content>

    <title>Internal Forecasts in Multi‐Location Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the dynamics of internal forecasting in multi‐location firms and the relations between forecast characteristics and investment. Using U.S. Census microdata on plant‐level growth expectations, we find that plants within multi‐location firms make forecasts that are both more certain and less accurate than those of standalone plants. We provide evidence suggesting that headquarters infers uncertainty from inter‐plant forecast disagreement, and that headquarters is able to facilitate the use of relevant information held by one plant but applicable to another. Differences between peer and focal plants' forecasts predict forecast errors and relate to investment decisions at the focal plant, suggesting that information from multiple sources is integrated into capital allocation decisions. Headquarters' heavier use of peer plant forecast information when focal plants are more uncertain likely weakens focal plant managers' incentives to consider extreme scenarios when forecasting.</content>

    <title>Bunch of jerks: How brands can benefit by reappropriating insults</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands are increasingly finding themselves on the receiving end of negative labels from a variety of sources. While sometimes warranted, many of these negative labels feel like unwarranted or uncivil insults. Brands generally respond to such undeserved degradation by ignoring the insult, denying the insult, or perhaps apologizing to the insulter. This research explores another potential strategy: reappropriating the insult. We reveal that reappropriation—an intentional act of verbatim self‐labeling with an externally imposed negative label—can garner unexpected benefits for brands, including greater advertisement click‐through rate, interest, and more positive attitudes. The advantage of reappropriation is driven by perceptions of the brand's confidence and humor and is specific to situations in which the reappropriated insult is perceived to be unjustified and ultimately benign in nature. This work contributes to our understanding of how brands can recover from negative events and how reappropriation operates uniquely in an unexplored marketplace context. We also provide a novel recovery tactic for brand managers facing certain types of hostility.</content>

    <title>From Workplace‐Based to Work‐Related Violence: Reframing &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Research and Practice in the Era of Growing Tensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Violence at work has traditionally been conceptualized in human resource management (HRM) as workplace‐based violence—an episodic, interpersonal issue occurring within bounded organizational settings. This perspective article adopts the term work‐related violence as a more expansive and timely framing, encompassing physical, psychological, and symbolic harm related to work but occurring across dispersed geographies, identities, relationships, and organizational arrangements. It contends that prevailing HRM frameworks remain ill‐equipped to address these fragmented and often unacknowledged harms, particularly as work becomes increasingly hybrid, precarious, and digitally mediated. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, we advance a multilevel and multistakeholder analytical framework that theorizes violence as relational and spatially unbounded, embedded across micro (identity and employees' lived experience, and psychological factors), meso (organizational culture, HRM systems and silencing mechanisms), and macro (regulatory, ideological, and institutional) levels. The framework further identifies underexplored domains of violence within HRM, including employee‐perpetrated violence, ideologically motivated aggression, and the critical role of community‐based interventions in mitigating harm. In doing so, the article contributes to HRM theory by problematizing the spatial and behavioral assumptions underpinning conventional approaches to workplace violence. We argue for a broadened research and practice agenda that expands the field's analytical and operational capacity, calling for the development of HRM models that are structurally, institutionally, and ideologically attuned to violence emerging from inequality, institutional complicity, and the broader political economies of contemporary work.</content>

    <title>The Role of Taxes in the Rise of ETFs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that a lesser known yet economically significant tax-deferral feature of ETFs’ security design is crucial to their success. By relying on the in-kind redemption exemption, authorized participants help ETFs avoid distributing capital gains and reduce their tax overhang, partly by deploying heartbeat trades. We estimate that the ETF tax efficiency has increased long-term investors’ after-tax returns by 1.05% per year relative to mutual funds in recent years. Exploiting cross-sectional and time-series variations in investors’ tax burden, we show that tax efficiency is a significant driver of capital migration by high-net-worth investors from mutual funds into ETFs.

    <title>Bargaining Foundations for the Outside Option Principle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a bargaining game in which a seller can trade with one of two buyers, who have values h and l (h &amp;gt; l). The outside option principle (OOP) predicts that the seller trades with the high-value buyer with probability converging to 1 at a price converging to max (h/2,l) as players become patient. While this prediction is supported by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), a wide range of trading outcomes may emerge in subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs): in the patient limit, the seller can obtain any price in the interval [h/2,h] (and no other); moreover, allocative inefficiency and costly delay are possible. We propose equilibrium refinements less restrictive than Markov behavior that guarantee trading outcomes consistent with the OOP. One refinement requires that a buyer's relative probability of trade does not increase dramatically following a failed negotiation with that buyer. Another refinement posits that the seller does not approach a buyer hoping that negotiations fail. SPEs satisfying both refinements conform with the OOP (but need not be MPEs). Our benchmark model features strategic matching by the seller. We provide a parallel analysis for the random matching protocol. Under random matching, prices in SPEs may also rise above and fall below l, but have a narrower range. A refinement particular to this protocol that restores the OOP requires that a random mismatch should not impact the seller excessively.</content>

    <title>Legislators’ demand for firms’ financial statements: evidence from U.S. congressional redistricting events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether U.S. House representatives and their staff seek financial information from constituent firms to inform their legislative decisions. We exploit shifts in U.S. congressional districts (i.e., the reconfiguration of federal district lines or redistricting) that introduce new constituent firms to legislators’ districts. To the extent that legislators and their staff collect and rely on firms’ financial statement information, we expect that a change in representation as a result of redistricting will result in a significant and observable change in searches for information about new constituent firms. Our evidence supports this prediction. We also find that the timing of searching coincides with legislators’ roll call votes, particularly ahead of more controversial bills and for bills lobbied by sample firms. Finally, we find that new constituent firms respond to increased information demands after a redistricting event by supplying more policy-relevant disclosures and increasing lobbying.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint Shelf Design and Space Planning Problem with Placement Options</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sandra Zajac, Heinrich Kuhn</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces the first joint shelf design and space planning problem that considers two placement options for items – hanging and shelving – on flexible shelves. These types of shelves are used in sectors such as do-it-yourself and toy retail, and for household goods in grocery stores. However, they have received limited attention in the literature, which typically focuses on regular shelves with a single placement option: placing items on shelf panels. The problem requires three interdependent decisions: (1) the placement option for each item (shelving or hanging), (2) the shelf design (number and vertical positioning of shelf panels), and (3) the shelf space planning (assignment of facings as well as the vertical and horizontal positioning of items). We formalize this problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop a greedy multi-start matheuristic to efficiently solve practical instances. Computational experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms both a commercial solver and a benchmark method for two-dimensional shelf space planning in terms of runtime and solution quality.A comprehensive analysis of synthetic instances and a real-world case study provides several managerial insights. First, hanging items enables more flexible use of shelf space, which is especially beneficial when item variety is high. However, when large vertical grabbing gaps must be considered, stacking items on shelf panels may be more advantageous. In turn, there is a risk of wasted space due to height or width mismatches. Second, the number and size of the segments on the shelf significantly influence layout profitability, highlighting the need to jointly optimize shelf design and space allocation. Third, it is common practice to arrange hanging items in horizontal rows, which can be facilitated by segmenting the shelf space. While this improves visual appeal, increasing the number of segments tends to reduce overall space utilization and profitability. Finally, a real-world case study involving 237 products across six categories from a European grocery retailer confirms the practical applicability of our approach. It demonstrates significant potential for improving space utilization and layout efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, the authors examine the impact of star creator exits on digital content markets, leveraging exogenous events on Twitch.tv. Using a Synthetic DiD approach, they estimate the causal effects of star creators’ exits from the live streaming platform. Their findings reveal that, at the live streaming category level, the exit of a star creator leads to a sizable decrease in both content provision and consumption within the star creator’s focal category. At the individual creator level, the effects are heterogeneous, varying by the creator’s audience size and contractual status with the platform. Major creators reduce their content provision, while micro creators maintain their streaming activity, though both groups experience a decline in viewership. Additionally, contracted creators tend to sustain their content provision levels following a star creator’s exit, whereas non-contracted creators exhibit a significant decline. Lastly, the authors find that the impact of a star creator’s departure persists for several months, indicating a lasting effect at both the category and individual levels.</content>

    <title>Reputational judgments of foreign MNEs’ societal impact in frontier markets: the role of compatible, crossed, and conflicting signals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do host country stakeholders evaluate foreign MNEs’ local impact? Although MNEs’ desire for a reputation for positive societal impact is well-established in the literature, much less is known about how to actually obtain one—especially in less developed frontier markets. In this inductive, qualitative study across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we examine why host country stakeholders deem some foreign MNEs to have a better reputation for societal impact than others and how firms’ actions and attributes influence these stakeholder perceptions. Leveraging signaling theory, we identify three distinct types of signals (compatible, crossed, and conflicting) and three critical factors (benefit diffusion, empowerment, and hybrid solutions) that shape MNEs’ reputation for societal impact. We also shed light on the role of contextual factors at the country, industry, and community levels. In addition to these theoretical contributions, our study also yields practical implications for MNEs of including local stakeholders’ perspectives when crafting market and nonmarket strategies, fostering constructive communication between headquarters and subsidiaries as well as between expatriate and local actors, and finding ways of going beyond ‘fitting in’ to instead ‘stand out’ in order to gain a reputation for providing tangible and intangible forms of societal impact in frontier markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wholesale market makers pay for retail options orders that must be executed on exchanges. Payment for order flow (PFOF) wholesalers compete via price improvement in exchange auctions. To attract retail orders, wholesalers run more auctions when their recent price improvement has been lower. However, auction price improvement lowers market maker revenues. Wholesalers earn revenues to pay PFOF in nonauction trades where their designated market maker status increases their execution priority. While some auctions produce substantial price improvement, most do not have multiple bidders offering meaningful price improvement. Overall, options market structure better promotes competition in auctions than in nonauctions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyse the behaviour of multinational enterprises (MNEs) within a host nation – Australia – during deglobalization (1914–79). Deglobalization is often portrayed as a drastic event to which MNEs respond swiftly, probably through withdrawal from host countries. However, we generate new FDI and firm population data to reveal incumbent MNEs remained. We then deploy historical primary evidence from three companies to analyse their responses. Firms adapted by deepening their local engagement, drawing on local information sources and entrepreneurship, and by shifting some strategic control to the subsidiary. These adaptations extended across decades, as each MNE wrestled with knowledge gaps and organizational rigidities that reflected its particular administrative heritage. Our historical methodology also reveals how firms were affected differently, responded at different speeds, and varied in their subsequent embeddedness. We conclude that deglobalization's impact on firms may be a subtle, reiterative, and prolonged process, rather than a sudden and dramatic event.</content>

Six pre‐registered studies provide evidence of acharity capacity cursewhereby donors penalize charities for displaying capacity cues, such as human resources capacity, organizational capacity, and financial capacity cues. This curse occurs because donors perceive higher‐capacity charities as needing less help. As donors typically donate based on need, they donate less to charities with superior capacity signals. This effect is attenuated when: (1) higher‐capacity charities' needs are made salient, and (2) donors reflect on how their decision impacts end‐beneficiaries. This research contributes to the literature on effective altruism and charity perceptions while offering managerial insights for charities seeking to optimize their fundraising communications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a new source for the declining role of small banks in the banking industry: Long-term changes in the banking sector are partially a consequence of changes in the industrial sector. Small banks are relatively more exposed to small business shocks, because small businesses compose a larger share of their customers. Lower real-side demand for small business financial services is responsible for part of the relative decline in small banks’ deposits. Rough calculations suggest that deposits at small banks would have been $280 billion higher from 2002 to 2017 if small firms had grown at the rate of larger firms. (JEL G21, G34, L25, R12)</content>

    <title>How Does Removing the Tax Benefits of Debt Affect Firms? Evidence from the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of tax benefits of debt on firms remains an open question. The 2017 U.S. tax reform limited the tax advantage of debt for all firms except for small businesses with average sales below $25 million. A regression discontinuity design based on the exception threshold shows that, as tax benefits of debt shrink, corporate debt declines significantly, while equity does not increase sufficiently to offset the reduction. Treated firms also decrease their investments due to the higher cost of capital. Overall, we document a first-order role for tax incentives that affect the cost of capital in shaping corporate policies. (JEL G31, G32, G38, H25, K34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the causal effects of precommitment framing, motivational deadlines, and semi-personalized information on military servicemembers’ retirement savings using a randomized field experiment. Low-cost emails highlighting a motivational deadline or semi-personalized salary information increased participation by about 1 percentage point (control mean is 1.25 percent) and contribution rates by about 0.05 percentage points (control mean is 3.92 percent) among previous non-participants. These programs demonstrate a cost-effective and scalable tool by which managers can increase employees’ retirement savings.</content>

    <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fairness concerns arise naturally across a wide range of decision-making contexts and application domains. Addressing these concerns requires integrating fairness measures into optimization models; however, quantifying fairness, as well as formulating and solving fairness-promoting optimization problems, remain significant challenges. In “A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures,” M. Y. Tsang and K. S. Shehadeh propose a new framework that unifies different fairness measures into a general, parameterized class of convex fairness measures. They introduce a unified framework for optimization problems with a convex fairness measure objective or constraint, including unified reformulations and solution methods. Additionally, they establish mechanisms for quantifying the impact of employing different convex fairness measures on the optimal solutions to the resulting fairness-promoting optimization problem. Numerical experiments, including applications to resource allocation and facility location, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the unified framework over traditional ones.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a scenario in which an employee exerts productive effort to achieve a target but can also manipulate a performance measure to falsely claim target achievement. Although manipulation is detrimental from a societal perspective because of its negative externalities, the firm’s shareholders may benefit from undetected manipulation. We analyze the firm’s optimal implementation of internal control and its impact on the employee’s productive effort and manipulative behavior. We demonstrate that a profit-maximizing firm primarily utilizes internal control to enhance the employee’s performance pay contract; however, this does not necessarily reduce manipulation. We identify situations in which internal control reduces or aggravates manipulation and discuss factors that can complement internal control to combat manipulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), Project ID 403041268–TRR 266, Accounting for Transparency and under Germany’s Excellence Strategy, EXC 2126/1–390838866.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04232 .</content>

    <title>Painful Prices: The Moral Harm Model of Price Fairness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ responses to seller’s prices, including perceptions of price fairness and unfairness, are a crucial aspect of the marketplace. While past literature has uncovered a variety of factors that influence perceptions of price fairness (PPF), the lack of an overarching conceptual framework has constrained understanding of when and why consumers are more likely to perceive prices as fair or unfair. The authors develop a conceptual model of PPF as moral judgments and propose that these moral PPF arise from consumer inferences of potential harm from a price. The conceptualization suggests that inferred harm—and thereby, PPF—are influenced by consumer vulnerability, product welfare impact and firm price strategy (e.g., costs and prices, differential pricing and price promotions). The authors also propose that consumer political orientation and inferred firm self-defense motives moderate the relationship between inferred harm and PPF and that inferred firm motives for prices influence PPF. Eight studies test this conceptualization. The results support the moral harm model and provide novel insights, showing when unchanged prices, price increases and price decreases are likely to be perceived as more unfair, and when differential prices (including paying more than others) are likely to be perceived as fairer than equal prices.</content>

    <title>Voluntary Technology Sharing to Rivals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a firm’s incentive to share its proprietary technology to help a rival develop a new product. Whereas the rival’s product introduction increases competitive pressure on the firm, it also turns the rival into a multiproduct firm, raising cannibalization concerns that affect its pricing strategy. We find that the rival’s internal cannibalization may soften competition in the existing product market, creating a positive externality for the focal firm and, thus, motivating voluntary technology sharing. We characterize the conditions under which the firm benefits from sharing: generally, the firm is incentivized to share if the new product’s valuation is neither too high nor too low. A high valuation of the new product deters sharing because of excessive competition, whereas a low valuation fails to trigger cannibalization, eliminating the firm’s incentive to share. Our analysis further shows that new product introduction generally enhances social welfare except when the existing product has high valuation and the new product has relatively low valuation. Consumer surplus increases only when the existing product’s valuation is low. These findings offer guidance for policymakers, suggesting when favorable policies should be implemented to promote technology sharing in cases in which social welfare or consumer surplus is not maximized.</content>
