    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Different types of affective climates—norms related to the experience, expression, use, and regulation of emotions—have been shown to impact organizational outcomes. However, we know less about how these climates emerge. This study investigates the emergence of affective climates through a 22‐month longitudinal multiple‐case study of five early‐stage start‐ups. Our analysis revealed that an affective climate of high authenticity emerged in start‐ups through three key mechanisms: the interaction between positive and negative emotions, constructive meta‐emotions, and interpersonal emotion regulation characterized by emotional validation and problem‐solving. Our findings contribute to the understanding of affective climate emergence and offer nuanced insights into how founders, managers, and teams can cultivate constructive emotional dynamics in highly uncertain, fast‐paced environments.Managerial SummaryWe explore how affective climate emerges through a longitudinal case study of five start‐ups. Affective climate describes norms and assumptions concerning the experience, expression, use, and regulation of emotions. Research suggests that an affective climate of high authenticity—meaning that members feel free to express their actual emotions—contributes to creativity and performance while reducing burnout. However, prior research offers few insights into how and why different affective climates emerge in start‐ups. We find that managers and founders may shape their organization's affective climate toward high authenticity by fostering positive emotions, through an accepting attitude toward their own negative emotions, and by validating employees' emotions. By doing so, managers and founders can foster healthy emotional dynamics in their start‐ups.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the increased use of data technologies, like machine learning, by financial intermediaries affect the allocation of capital towards innovation? I study this question in the context of startup financing by venture capitalists (VCs). While VCs adopting data technologies become better at screening startups similar to those in historical data, they tilt their investments towards this pool and become concurrently less likely to finance innovative startups that achieve rare major success. Plausibly exogenous variations in VCs’ screening automation suggest that these effects are causal. These findings highlight how investors’ adoption of data technologies can have real effects through innovation financing. (JEL G24, L26, O30)</content>

    <title>Teams in Crisis: The Effect of Team Familiarity on Performance Under Conditions of Crisis and Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on fluid teams has consistently found a positive relationship between team familiarity and performance, but little empirical research has investigated whether these benefits of familiarity extend to times of crisis and uncertainty. This study examines how team familiarity influences provider decision times in the emergency department, focusing on how its effects vary across different crisis and uncertainty contexts. Using patient and provider assignment data from a large, multisite emergency department, we construct care team familiarity networks and analyze familiarity’s impact on decision-making speed during both low-uncertainty crises (high-acuity patient surges) and high-uncertainty crises (early COVID-19 pandemic), as well as under conditions of patient-level task uncertainty. We find that team familiarity consistently reduces provider decision times; familiarity is particularly beneficial during crises. However, across both crisis and noncrisis situations, we find that the positive effects of familiarity are significantly weakened under conditions of high uncertainty. These findings underscore the conditional nature of familiarity’s benefits, suggesting that in highly uncertain or novel situations, teams cannot rely solely on past shared experience to maintain performance. Implications for staffing strategies in healthcare and other high-stakes environments highlight the need for organizations to balance the benefits of familiarity with adaptability in the face of uncertainty.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2025.20912 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present an experimental study of investors’ willingness to pay for socially responsible assets. In our initial public offering experiment, various assets share identical financial risk-return profiles but differ in the intensity and timing of societal benefits, represented by charitable donations. We find that subjects value societal benefits positively and prefer a positive correlation between financial returns and these societal benefits. We offer implications for the design of corporate social responsibility policies and for the pricing of responsible assets.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Chair on Sustainable Finance at Toulouse School of Economics.

    <title>Motivator or Depletor? Unraveling the Double‐Edged Effects of Peer Monitoring on Employee Job Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer monitoring, as a type of organizational control, is increasingly important in managing employee performance. However, extant research primarily focuses on the benefits of peer monitoring on job performance, while largely ignoring its potential negative consequences. We advance the literature to theorize and test the double‐edged effects of peer monitoring on job performance by examining its self‐regulatory consequences. Specifically, we propose that peer monitoring can simultaneously increase both work engagement and ego depletion, which in turn exert positive and negative impacts on job performance, respectively. Furthermore, we theorize that trait self‐control is a critical contingent factor that moderates both the positive and negative pathways from peer monitoring to job performance. We test our model through a two‐wave, multisource field survey study involving 203 employees and their 49 direct supervisors in China, as well as through an experimental study with 149 full‐time working employees in the United States. We find consistent evidence for the negative consequences of peer monitoring on job performance via ego depletion, while the positive pathway through work engagement is only supported by the field survey study. Furthermore, both studies show that there is a positive indirect effect of peer monitoring on job performance via work engagement when employees have lower trait self‐control and a negative indirect effect via ego depletion when employees have higher trait self‐control. Such examination helps elucidate the positive and negative effects of peer monitoring on job performance and has important theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that socially responsible investors can have a negative impact by slowing the pace of firm reform. Investors with broad prosocial preferences value acquiring dirty firms with high negative production externalities because they can reform these firms. The anticipation of trading gains for dirty firms decreases the incentive of current firm owners to reduce externalities proactively, potentially causing delay in reform. The presence of financial investors—alongside socially responsible investors—can exacerbate delay. Investment mandates through which socially responsible investors commit to paying a premium for green firms can incentivize reform in a timely manner. (JEL G11, G23, G24, G34, H41, M14)</content>

    <title>Auctions with Frictions: Recruitment, Entry, and Limited Commitment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Auction models are convenient abstractions of informal price-formation processes that arise in markets for assets or services. These processes involve frictions like bidder recruitment costs for sellers, participation costs for bidders, and limitations on sellers’ commitment abilities. This paper develops an auction model that captures such frictions. We derive novel insights, notably that outcomes are often inefficient, that markets sometimes unravel, and that the observability of competition may have a large effect.</content>

    <title>Scandal, Associative Stigma, and Sorting in Labor Markets: Archival and Experimental Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stigma stemming from managerial scandals often spreads beyond the implicated transgressor and contaminates other actors via stigma by association. We study how associative stigma resulting from scandals involving managerial misconduct affects subordinate worker careers. We extend prior work by distinguishing between managerial misconduct in the professional domain from managerial misconduct in the personal domain and theorize that this distinction will affect the severity of associative stigma, audience evaluations, and associated workers’ labor market outcomes. Our multimethod empirical approach combines archival analysis of administrative employment records with a series of preregistered, randomized vignette experiments. Our archival analysis demonstrates that workers associated with managers who engage in misconduct sort into organizations with a history of managerial misconduct. The magnitude of this effect is amplified when associative stigma arises from managerial misconduct in the personal domain, a pattern driven by the fact that associative stigma arising from managerial misconduct in the professional domain tends to carry a relatively stronger labor market penalty and increased likelihood of worker exit from the industry. Our experimental studies, which measure employment intentions of workers and hiring intentions of employers, suggest that the psychological mechanism of stigma apprehension plays a role in facilitating the sorting that we observe, a result consistent with the interpretation that sorting emerges from greater tolerance of actors stigmatized by association rather than a taste for misconduct and thus, affirmative assortative matching. These findings contribute to the stigma literature by showing how stigma by association effects vary across audiences and linking this variation to sorting outcomes.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funded: The authors thank the Blake Family Fund for Ethics, Leadership, and Governance at Purdue University for supporting this research.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00075 .</content>

    <title>Textual Factors: A Scalable, Interpretable, and Data-Driven Approach to Analyzing Unstructured Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a general approach for analyzing large-scale text-based data, combining the strengths of neural network language processing and generative statistical modeling to create a factor structure of unstructured data for downstream regressions typically used in social sciences. We generate textual factors by (i) representing texts using vector word embedding, (ii) clustering the vectors using locality-sensitive hashing to generate supports of topics, and (iii) identifying relatively interpretable spanning clusters (i.e., textual factors) through topic modeling. Our data-driven approach captures complex linguistic structures while ensuring computational scalability and economic interpretability, plausibly attaining certain advantages over and complementing other unstructured data analytics used by researchers, including emergent large language models. We conduct initial validation tests of the framework and discuss three types of its applications: (i) enhancing prediction and inference with texts, (ii) interpreting (non–text-based) models, and (iii) constructing new text-based metrics and explanatory variables. We illustrate each of these applications using examples in finance and economics such as macroeconomic forecasting from news articles, interpreting multifactor asset pricing models from corporate filings, and measuring theme-based technology breakthroughs from patents. Finally, we provide a flexible statistical package of textual factors for online distribution to facilitate future research and applications.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Becker Friedman Institute of Economics, the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, INQUIRE Europe, the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, and the Risk Institute at OSU Fisher College of Business (while L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study employee mental health to assess the long-term nonmonetary consequences of mergers. Using employer-employee level data linked to individual health records, we document that the incidences of stress, anxiety, depression, and psychiatric medication usage increase following mergers. These effects are prevalent among employees from both targets and acquirers, in weak and in growing profitable firms. Employees who experience negative career developments within the merging firms, ‘blue-collar’ workers, and employees with lower skills are most affected. Mergers that generate more mental illness among employees perform worse after the transaction. A variety of tests address endogeneity concerns.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: Funding from the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (Misum) and the Nasdaq Nordic Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04277 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study supply‐and‐demand effects in the U.S. Treasury bill market by comparing the returns on T‐bills to the policy rate on the Federal Reserve's reverse repurchase (RRP) facility. We develop and test a simple model where the RRP‐bill spread is policed both by heterogeneously elastic money funds and by corporate treasurers who derive collateral benefits from holding T‐bills. In response to shifts in T‐bill supply, money funds act as front‐line arbitrageurs. However, when T‐bills become extremely scarce, less elastic corporate treasurers become the marginal investors and supply shifts have a larger effect on T‐bill rates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances the understanding of innovation across generations in family businesses by revealing how imprinting and self-determination shape innovation trajectories following succession. Through a case study of 16 Dutch family Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry, we identified four innovation trajectories—Inherited, Ancillary, Synergistic, and Detached Innovation. We disentangle the effect of structural imprinting and behavioral imprinting on the successor and examine how successor self-determination mediates imprinting forces. We rebalance the emphasis on incumbent-centric family business studies and explain the heterogeneity of post-succession innovation outcomes. These insights offer new theoretical tools for understanding and managing innovation during critical transition periods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some research has suggested that investors prefer pitches made by men rather than women entrepreneurs, and physically attractive men entrepreneurs are even more successful than their physically unattractive counterparts. However, empirical evidence remains limited. We re-examine these findings using a large archival dataset with 9,285 entrepreneurs across 13 industries and 105 countries between the years of 2014 to 2018. Our results replicate the female penalty effect—women raised 12.9% less funds compared to men. However, we found that the physical attractiveness of the entrepreneurs has a negative main effect on startups’ success, and that this effect is only significant for men entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study intermediation in the housing market. Using data from an online platform utilized by real estate agents to generate leads, we identify exogenous intermediary attention arising from the quasi-randomized ordering of potential listings. Greater intermediary attention leads to an increased probability of listing with an agent and selling quickly, and a higher transaction price. The listing and transaction probabilities of neighboring properties decrease in intermediary attention. These results contrast sharply with endogenous correlations and provide causal evidence that intermediaries resolve property-level frictions deriving from search, information, or behavioral considerations but do not mitigate neighborhood-level information asymmetries.</content>

    <title>Slum Upgrading and Long-run Urban Development: Evidence from Indonesia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Developing countries face massive urbanization and slum upgrading is a popular policy to improve shelter for many. Yet, preserving slums at the expense of formal developments can raise concerns of misallocation of land. We estimate causal, long-term impacts of the 1969-1984 KIP program, which provided basic upgrades to 5 million residents covering 25% of land in Jakarta, Indonesia. We assemble high-resolution data on program boundaries and 2015 outcomes and address program selection bias through localized comparisons. On average, KIP areas today have lower land values, shorter buildings, and are more informal, per a photographs-based slum index. The negative effects are concentrated within 5km of the CBD. We develop a spatial equilibrium model to characterize the welfare implications of KIP. Counterfactuals suggest that 79% of the welfare effects stem from removing KIP in the center and highlight how to mitigate losses to displaced residents.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Competitive Collection in Closed-Loop Supply Chain</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recycling and remanufacturing have gained significance and popularity in response to growing environmental concerns and economic pressures. Although previous studies have extensively examined the competitive collection in a closed-loop supply chain, they ignored the pricing decisions in both the forward and reverse channels. In this paper, we develop a two-period analytical framework that considers pricing decisions in both the forward and reverse channels to explore the impacts of competitive collection on optimal prices and profits within a closed-loop supply chain. This study focuses on three distinct used-product collection models: (1) the manufacturer collects used products directly from consumers; (2) the manufacturer outsources the collection activity to a third-party collector (TPC); and (3) the manufacturer and TPC engage in a competitive collection. Our analysis uncovers several intriguing insights. First, competitive collection does not necessarily increase the collecting price for consumers as the TPC prefers to increase its collecting price while the manufacturer prefers to reduce its collecting price. Second, the TPC’s increased collecting price does not force the manufacturer to increase his transfer price for the TPC. Third, competitive collection will benefit those consumers who buy the remanufactured product as the price of this product decreases. Fourth, the manufacturer and retailer may be better off directly or through revenue-sharing mechanisms in competitive collection. In addition, the competitive collection could also achieve a win–win situation in terms of financial performance and environmental sustainability. Lastly, when the competitive collection is between the manufacturer and retailer, the manufacturer benefits from the competition but the retailer does not. This paper also discusses the intuition behind these findings and their managerial implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Forced displacement crises have become a pressing humanitarian concern. Refugee movements expose individuals to dire living conditions with severe inaccessibility to essential resources. Humanitarian organizations play a vital role in alleviating these hardships through relief aid interventions. This study aims to optimize the fulfillment of recurring needs for geographically dispersed refugee groups en route to safe destinations. Here, capacitated mobile facilities are tasked with delivering relief aid to refugee groups periodically to ensure equitable service frequency. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process with multinomial state-transition distributions, shaped by external migration pull factors such as safety conditions, road accessibility, and spatial proximity. The objective is to minimize the relocation and replenishment costs of mobile facilities, along with the deprivation costs faced by underserved refugees. We develop an approximate dynamic programming algorithm featuring a novel policy replication routine. To complement this offline method, we introduce a state-dependent variable threshold policy that enables high-quality, real-time relief provision. Using instances inspired by the Syrian refugee crisis, our results demonstrate the substantial value of stochastic modeling, yielding a 25% reduction in expected total costs compared to deterministic baselines and up to 12% savings through coordinated planning among humanitarian actors. The proposed methods remain effective under dispersed and cohesive refugee group dynamics and multi-destination migration scenarios. Furthermore, we uncover high-frequency traversal and service hotspots along migration paths to provide tactical insights for parameter calibration and resource prepositioning. Collectively, our findings offer practical insights for managing ongoing and future refugee migration crises.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Refining Data-driven Upfront Reservation Discount Pricing via Inverse Inferring Newsvendor Transactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the supplier’s pricing problem under upfront reservation discount (URD) contracts where the buyer reserves products in advance and then adjusts the purchase quantity based on realized end-market demand. A key challenge is that the supplier typically has limited data to estimate the demand distribution and possesses inferior information compared to the buyer. To address the challenges of distributional ambiguity and information asymmetry, we develop a Refined Distributionally Robust Optimization (RDRO) model for the supplier’s URD pricing to maximize her worst-case profit. To better infer true demand patterns, beyond the conventional reliance on historical demand data, our approach leverages past transaction records involving supplier-buyer interactions through the inverse optimization underlying the first-order conditions of the buyer’s newsvendor behavior. Then, a general Wassersteinp-distance minimization problem forp≥1 is developed to generate a Refined Empirical Distribution (RED) in the enhanced set. We prove that the RED provides a superior estimation of the true demand distribution compared to the classical empirical distribution when the buyer holds an informational advantage. Although identifying the RED leads to an intractable semi-infinite program, we show that the RED admits a closed-form solution. To obtain the supplier’s worst-case profit involving a non-convex distributionally optimistic optimization problem with a decision-dependent uncertainty set, we exploit the monotone transport structure between univariate distributions to truncate the distributions and convert the decision-dependent quantile constraints, which results in a finite-dimensional convex model that can be efficiently solved. Moreover, we extend the model to accommodate data noise, volatile market prices, evolving market conditions, and multi-item settings. Numerical experiments based on a virtual machine reservation problem in the cloud service market demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crises are accompanied by resource shortages, operational challenges, and shifts in demand for resources. During crises, non-profit organizations have historically played a crucial role in mitigating these challenges, with crowdfunding platforms emerging as a new solution for resource mobilization. In this study, we examine how individual and institutional donors respond to the sudden shifts in demand that accompany a global crisis. We analyze rich, granular data from multiple sources, including donation data from a leading education crowdfunding platform, before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and find notable contrasts between individual and institutional responses. While there was a significant increase in institutional donations during the pandemic, individual donations remained relatively stable overall. Adopting a motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, we center donor heterogeneity in our approach, deriving nuanced insights. Donations from individuals in economically disadvantaged communities, which were the worst impacted by the crisis, decreased; however, these communities prioritized immediate and time-sensitive needs. Small and local institutions played a pivotal role in supporting high-need schools during the crisis. These findings make meaningful contributions to the operations literature on crowdfunding and have practical implications for platform designers. By distinguishing between individual and institutional donors and identifying the factors that drive their behavior, our study offers important implications for platform designers to improve crisis-time resource mobilization through more targeted engagement strategies.</content>

    <title>Good Lessons Despite Bad Feelings: How Boundary-Spanning Teams Learn from Collaboration Failure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To stay competitive, organizations set up boundary-spanning teams (BSTs) to learn from external partners. However, collaborating across boundaries is challenging and BSTs often face collaboration failure, defined as divergence from desired or expected collaboration goals. Given the costs associated with such failures, they usually evoke negative emotions which often lead to blaming the external partner and a collaboration breakdown, undermining joint learning from failure. This raises the question of how BSTs can learn from collaboration failure despite negative emotions. Our inductive study on drug discovery teams provides a silver lining: certain emotive-cognitive conditions can give rise to learning interactions that allow BSTs to either neutralize or transform their negative emotions into positive ones. Averting collaboration breakdown, these interactions allow BSTs to both create and integrate explicit knowledge after collaboration failure and change their collaboration dynamics in order to prevent failure in the future and improve their way of collaborating. Our study brings forward an emotive perspective on learning from collaboration failure and expands the literature on BSTs and emotions in groups. It further informs management practices on how to overcome negative emotions and beliefs so that BSTs sustain fruitful collaborations, enabling critical innovations such as treatments for diseases to be further developed.</content>

    <title>Culture as a Toolkit for Robust Action: Tackling Grand Challenges with Cultural Entrepreneurship</title>
    <updated>2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A new grand challenges paradigm has emerged in organization theory that has reoriented scholarly attention toward how society can effectively tackle a broad array of complex, uncertain, and evaluative matters of concern including climate change, forcible displacement, poverty, authoritarianism, child malnutrition, commercial sex exploitation, and many more. In this paper, I argue that the literature has tended toward a view of culture as a constraining force that inhibits tackling grand challenges and renders them remarkably intractable. Yet, alternative views of culture also purport that it can serve not merely as a constraining force that prevents action but also as a toolkit or repertoire of resources that actors use to solve problems and thus an enabling force for progress. The substantial literature on cultural entrepreneurship provides several powerful theoretical affordances that are uniquely useful in overcoming known obstacles to addressing grand challenges. I draw on the intellectual resources of this literature to augment the robust action model—one of the premiere theoretical frameworks for tackling grand challenges—by expanding each of the three robust action strategies through an integration with cultural entrepreneurship. This theoretical elaboration advances our understanding of the early moments of initiation of robust action strategies when they are merely uncertain future possibilities, as well as the culturally informed ensuing dynamics by which robust action continues in perpetuity. I conclude by discussing a new generative dialogue at the interstice of these two domains which has substantial synergies for future scholarship.</content>

    <title>Unsettling Settled Knowing: Reconciling Differences in Expert Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Occupational subgroups with similar training often develop differing work practices within their local settings. These differences may create inconsistencies when organizational change brings subgroups together to work alongside each other. Based on a two-year qualitative study of a hospital merger combining two neonatal intensive care units, we consider how differing expert practices may be challenged, preserved, or reconciled when subgroups are brought together. We find that reconciliation processes are unexpectedly triggered by novice newcomers who struggle to socialize into a consistent way of working. Comparing five expert practices over time, we also find that when groups are able to converge around the type of knowledge that should apply to expert practices (abstract versus experiential knowledge), a form of reconciliation is possible, but when there is divergence around the type of knowledge that is relevant to the situation, reconciliation fails. Converging on experiential knowledge implies a simplified process of reconciliation that preserves expert autonomy while masking residual differences. Converging on abstract knowledge involves a complex, multilayered process in which expert subgroups need to revert in part to mechanisms resembling those that underpinned their initial socialization into the discipline. These mechanisms include mobilizing evidence to update abstract knowledge, situated mentoring with respected experts, and authoritative reinforcing via interventions from high-status professionals. Our study highlights the challenges of changing expert practices that are rooted in ingrained experiential knowledge. It reveals that abstract knowledge alone is insufficient and that reconciliation invariably involves settlements and agreements on what form of knowledge matters.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entropy-Regularized Wasserstein Distributionally Robust OptimizationUncertainty in data poses a central challenge in operations research. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) offers a principled framework for addressing this challenge by producing solutions resilient to distributional variations. Among various DRO approaches, the Wasserstein DRO has received significant attention though its computational efficiency relies on stringent assumptions, and its worst case distributions are typically discrete. In “Sinkhorn Distributionally Robust Optimization,” Wang, Gao, and Xie leverage the Sinkhorn distance—an entropy-regularized variant of the Wasserstein distance—to more realistically model uncertainty, enhancing computational efficiency. The authors establish a strong duality reformulation and propose a first order stochastic mirror descent algorithm with provable complexity guarantees for general loss functions. Unlike Wasserstein DRO, Sinkhorn DRO yields continuous worst case distributions, offering a more flexible representation of practical uncertainties. Extensive experiments in the newsvendor problem, portfolio optimization, and adversarial classification demonstrate its superior performance in both out-of-sample performance and efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pricing and Resource Allocation Made Simple for Service SystemsLarge-scale service systems—from drone delivery to cloud computing—face the dual challenge of balancing customer delays with revenue maximization. In “Near-Optimal Pricing and Resource Allocation in a Large-Scale Service System,” Wu, Liu, and Sun propose a dual-based pricing and resource allocation policy that is both simple and theoretically powerful. This greedy, one-step heuristic delivers performance guarantees matching the theoretical lower bound.Beyond the stylized model that illustrates its core idea, the study shows the value of dynamic pricing through an insensitivity result: any work-conserving rule can stabilize the system. The policy also proves robust under realistic conditions, including heterogeneous server pools and nonexponential service environments.Perhaps most striking, the authors uncover a “compensation effect”: near-optimal pricing curves need not rise monotonically with congestion. Instead, they may offset customers’ delay disutility to sustain revenue. These insights offer a practical, theory-backed framework for modern service operations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large-scale online platforms launch hundreds of randomized experiments (also known as A/B tests) every day to iterate their operations and marketing strategies. The combinations of these treatments are typically not exhaustively tested, which triggers an important question of both academic and practical interest. Without observing the outcomes of all treatment combinations, how does one estimate the causal effect of any treatment combination and identify the optimal treatment combination? We develop a novel framework combining deep learning and doubly robust estimation to estimate the causal effect of any treatment combination for each user on the platform when observing only a small subset of treatment combinations. Our proposed framework (called debiased deep learning ( DeDL )) exploits Neyman orthogonality and combines interpretable and flexible structural layers in deep learning. We show theoretically that this framework yields efficient, consistent, and asymptotically normal estimators under mild assumptions, thus allowing for identifying the best treatment combination when observing only a few combinations. To empirically validate our method, we collaborated with a large-scale video-sharing platform and implemented our framework for three experiments involving three treatments, where each combination of treatments is tested. When observing only a subset of treatment combinations, our DeDL approach significantly outperforms other benchmarks to accurately estimate and infer the average treatment effect of any treatment combination and to identify the optimal treatment combination.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Funding: R.

    <title>Roles of Artificial Intelligence in Collaboration with Humans: Automation, Augmentation, and the Future of Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans will see significant changes in the future of work as collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) will become commonplace. This work explores the benefits of AI in the setting of judgment tasks when it replaces humans (automation) and when it works with humans (augmentation). Through an analytical modeling framework, we show that the optimal use of AI for automation or augmentation depends on different types of human-AI complementarity. Our analysis demonstrates that the use of automation increases with higher levels of between-task complementarity. In contrast, the use of augmentation increases with higher levels of within-task complementarity. We integrate both automation and augmentation roles into our task allocation framework, where an AI and humans work on a set of judgment tasks to optimize performance with a given level of available human resources. We validate our framework with an empirical study based on experimental data in which humans classify images with and without AI support. When between-task complementarity and within-task complementarity exist, we see a consistent distribution of work pattern for optimal work configurations; AI automates relatively easy tasks, AI augments humans on tasks with similar human and AI performance, and humans work without AI on relatively difficult tasks. Our work provides several contributions to theory and practice. The findings on the effects of complementarity provide a nuanced view regarding the benefits of automation and augmentation. Our task allocation framework highlights potential job designs for the future of work, especially by considering the often-ignored, critical role of human resource reallocation in improving organizational performance.This paper has been accepted by D.

    <title>EXPRESS: The Weekend Effect in Online Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper finds that online reviews submitted during the weekend tend to have lower rating scores than reviews submitted during the week. Analyzing 400 million reviews across 33 e-commerce, hospitality, entertainment, and employer platforms, the authors find that weekend reviews have a 3% lower relative share of 5-star ratings and a 6% higher relative share of 1-, 2-, or 3-star ratings compared to weekday reviews. The pattern emerges even when controlling for quality of reviewed items. This weekend effect is surprising given that studies usually report higher happiness levels and a better mood on weekends. The authors discuss several explanations related towherethe review is submitted (platform characteristics),whatthe review is about (listing characteristics), andwhosubmits the review (reviewer characteristics). They present evidence that temporal self-selection of reviewers is a dominant driver of the weekend effect. During the weekend, a different set of users—those more prone to write negative reviews—is more likely to select to leave a review. These findings complement extant research on review self-selection by adding a temporal layer to the self-selection processes inherent in online reviews. This paper also highlights managerial implications by demonstrating that solicitations sent during the weekend (versus weekday solicitation) lead to collecting more negative reviews.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Real‐world contracts are typically private, observed only by their direct signatories, so agents working together are vulnerable to the principal opportunistically reducing other agents' incentives. The principal can mitigate this commitment problem by giving the most skilled agent a budget and delegating authority to write other agents' contracts. This endogenous hierarchy, never optimal with public contracts, raises effort, output, and compensation but allows rent extraction. The principal prefers it when contracts are opaque enough, skill is sufficiently heterogeneous across agents, and joint output is sensitive enough to effort. Our model provides novel predictions for the structure of banking syndicates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the increasing attention associated with ESG investing, a natural yet overlooked question is how investors would react to the ESG performance of firms, given that investors’ activities can ultimately impact firm performance. Utilizing data from multiple sources, we empirically find that ESG performance positively predicts future social media attention, but it has no predictive ability for future social media sentiment. Furthermore, the significant positive association between ESG and social media attention holds for both ESG downgrade events and ESG upgrade events. Moreover, the positive association between ESG and social media attention is driven by the environmental and social factors, whereas the uncorrelation between ESG and social media sentiment is determined by the social and governance factors. These findings urge managers to pay close attention to keeping and improving their firms’ ESG advantage. They help managers shed light on the picture of the return of their firms’ investment in ESG by taking investor behavior into account. Besides, ESG’s inability in predicting social media sentiment also indicates retail investors’ limited awareness of the importance of ESG currently. Therefore, it is pressing for regulators to take actions to boost the function of sustainable investing and ESG values.</content>

    <title>When Gig Workers No Longer Gig: The Impact of California Assembly Bill 5 on the Online Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid growth of the gig economy has intensified debates over how to classify workers. California’s Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) reclassifies many independent contractors as employees, yet its practical effects on gig workers remain unclear. Using data from a major online labor platform and a difference-in-differences design, we provide one of the first empirical assessments of AB5’s impact on workers’ earnings. We find that California gig workers’ monthly earnings rose relative to workers in other states, but this increase was driven by longer working hours, offsetting a drop in hourly pay. These results highlight the complex trade-offs of reclassification: although workers may gain access to employee benefits, they may also experience reduced hourly rates and increased workloads. For policymakers, our findings offer evidence to guide similar initiatives under consideration in other states and underscore the need for nuanced, context-sensitive regulation. For platform managers, the results suggest opportunities to align platform design and worker education with evolving labor laws to support compliance and sustainable growth. Together, these insights inform future policy and platform strategies aimed at balancing worker protection with flexibility in the gig economy.</content>

    <title>Programming Tasks Impact Responses to Moral Dilemmas for Novice Programmers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid diffusion of programming skills across education and industry may impact how individuals consider moral dilemmas. Across a series of experiments, we show that performing even simple programming tasks shifts novice programmers’ evaluation of the classic trolley problem toward utilitarian responses. After solving a programming problem, respondents are more willing to sacrifice one life to save many. This effect arises because programming induces a deliberative, rule-based cognitive style. However, the effect diminishes with greater programming experience and can be mitigated through interventions, such as time delays or moral nudges. These findings highlight that organizations training employees in coding should be aware that programming tasks may temporarily alter moral reasoning, potentially influencing judgments in ethically charged contexts (e.g., product design, risk management, or AI development). Incorporating reflective cooling-off periods or explicit ethical reinforcement may reduce bias toward utilitarian reasoning. As programming becomes a baseline skill across the workforce, its cognitive spillovers could shape societal attitudes toward contested moral dilemmas. These include ethical trade-offs in settings such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems.</content>

    <title>Common purpose advantage: Reviving a managerial theory of the firm?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the most effective way to distribute organizational objectives across managers? While prior work suggests managers should each focus on a single objective, we draw on Barnard's original insights on corporate purpose to identify conditions when managers pursuing the full set of objectives is advantageous. Using a computational model, we find that moderate strategic diversity amongst managers enables practice sharing to generate sufficiently valuable distant search to offset the additional complexity incurred during local search, creating a “common purpose advantage.” The advantage is stronger with fewer objectives, moderate objective correlation, less diversification, and moderate turbulence. Under other conditions, it dissipates or reverses. This work unifies scattered findings on multi‐objective firms, contributes to diversification research, and revives interest in the Managerial Theory of the Firm.Managerial SummaryHow should a firm distribute its objectives across its managers? Should each manager focus on a single objective, or should all collectively pursue the full set? Our research identifies the conditions for a “common purpose advantage,” where all managers pursuing the full set of objectives is superior. Using a computational model, we demonstrate this advantage arises when moderate strategic diversity amongst managers enables the sharing of valuable practices, which generates performance gains that offset the complexity of handling multiple goals. This advantage is strongest with fewer objectives, moderate environmental turbulence, and in less diversified firms. Under other conditions—such as high turbulence, many objectives, or high diversification—this advantage dissipates or reverses, making each manager focusing on a single objective more effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional and shadow banks interacted in similar ways in the 2007 and COVID-19 crises, when both assets and liabilities flew out of shadow banks and into traditional banks. We explain these facts in a model of the coexistence of traditional and shadow banks in which liabilities and assets flow from the former to the latter in good times, avoiding regulation, and move the other way in a crisis, alleviating fire sales. The model sheds light on how regulations for traditional banks have (unintended) consequences on the shadow banking sector. (JEL G01, G21, G23, G38)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper derives ex-ante confidence intervals for stock risk premium forecasts that are based on a wide range of linear and machine learning models. Exploiting the cross-sectional variation in the precision of risk premium forecasts, I provide improved investment strategies. The confident-high-low strategies that take long-short positions exclusively on stocks with precise risk premium forecasts outperform traditional high-low strategies in delivering superior out-of-sample returns and Sharpe ratios across all models. The outperformance increases (decreases) with the model complexity (bias). The confident-high-low strategies are economically interpretable as trading strategies of ambiguity-averse investors who account for confidence intervals around risk premium forecasts.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that high productivity-based macroeconomic uncertainty is associated with greater accumulation of physical capital despite a reduction in investment and valuations. To reconcile this puzzling evidence, we show that uncertainty predicts lower aggregate depreciation of existing capital, which dominates the investment slowdown. We explain these findings by developing a quantitative production-based model in which firms implement precautionary savings through reducing utilization rather than raising investment. Through this novel intensive-margin mechanism, uncertainty shocks command a quarter of the equity premium in general equilibrium. Flexibility in utilization adjustments also helps explain uncertainty risk exposures in the cross-section of industry returns. (JEL G12, E32, D81, D50)</content>

    <title>The Quantity-Quality Tradeoff: How Incentives and Monitoring Shape Gender Differences at Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do women and men approach the same work differently? Prior research across occupations shows that men tend to emphasize quantity and produce more, whereas women prioritize quality. Researchers have attributed these differences to individual-level factors, such as gender-specific preferences, caregiving responsibilities, and evaluator biases. We propose that organizational practices, specifically production incentives and quality monitoring, also influence these patterns. Using data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we conceptualize the quantity-quality tradeoff using examiner leniency and leverage discontinuities in incentives and monitoring to assess their effects. We theorize and find that stronger production incentives lead men to be more lenient than women, prioritizing quantity. Under heightened monitoring, women are less lenient than men, emphasizing quality. Further, monitoring moderates the relationship between incentives and gender differences in leniency such that the largest gender gap occurs under strong incentives and weak monitoring. Our study demonstrates that organizational practices interact with worker gender to shape the quantity-quality tradeoff, indicating that incentive and monitoring systems—though not designed to affect gender inequality—produce distinct and unintended effects that are essential to understanding and addressing workplace disparities.Funding: We greatly appreciate funding support from the Gender &amp; Work Initiative at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17754 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;E-commerce retailers often need to make inventory decisions for new products under high uncertainty. We study a new business practice of using crowdvoting, wherein a retailer first seeks input from customers on the desirability of the product and then bases the purchasing decision on their votes. We collaborated with a subscription-based apparel rental platform and obtained a proprietary data set comprising the platform’s products and users. We leverage the staggered introduction of crowdvoting in different product categories to identify whether and, if so, by how much the adoption of crowdvoting improves business performance. We find that, after the adoption, both short- and long-term rental outcomes increase. We also uncover several mechanisms that drive this improvement. We find that the platform uses the wisdom of the crowd to make better inventory depth decisions, and the products are inherently a better match with users’ tastes. Moreover, we find that brands bought through crowdvoting are more likely to be newer brands compared with items that are bought solely through expert input. In other words, the diversity of the brands carried on the platform also improves. We also find that voters become more engaged with the platform: they post more reviews and are less likely to cancel their subscription after participating in crowdvoting. Our results have important implications for retailers who may be considering similar crowd-based strategies to improve their decision making.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01928 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than three decades after Oviatt and McDougall’s pioneering 1994 paper ‘Towards a theory of international new ventures’, the study of early internationalizing firms continues to captivate international business scholars. The research questions we address involve the antecedents of early internationalization, the dimensions of this phenomenon and its performance outcomes. In the present study, we include all three issues in a comprehensive meta‐analysis, thereby gaining a more complete understanding of the early internationalization process while building upon the various partial pathways identified in extant research. We use meta‐analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) and build upon 426 samples from 378 empirical studies. We distinguish between the effects of individual‐level and firm‐level antecedents on the main dimensions of early internationalization – speed, scope, and intensity – and we assess the impact thereof on post‐entry performance. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of the constructs used in prior research, thereby laying the foundation for future empirical studies on early internationalization.</content>

    <title>Digital Distractions with Peer Influence: The Impact of Mobile App Usage on Academic and Labor Market Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns about excessive mobile phone use among youth are mounting. We present estimates of both behavioral and contextual peer effects, along with comprehensive evidence on how students’ own and their peers’ app usage affect academic performance, physical health, and labor market outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data from a Chinese university covering three student cohorts over four years. We exploit random roommate assignments, differential exposure to a policy shock (gaming restrictions for minors), and differential exposure to a discrete event (the introduction of a blockbuster video game) for identification. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own usage by 5.8%. High app usage is harmful across all measured outcomes. A one s.d. increase in app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage reduces a student’s GPAs and wages through both disruptions and behavioral spillovers, generating a total negative effect that exceeds half the magnitude of the impact from the student’s own app usage. Extending China’s three-hour-per-week gaming restriction for minors to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.9%. High-frequency GPS and app usage data show that heavy app users spend less time in study halls, are more frequently late or absent from class, and get less sleep.</content>

    <title>Unintended Consequences of Closing Pay Gaps Across Multiple Groups: A Formal Modeling and Simulation Analysis of Allocation Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, many firms have prioritized both pay equity (i.e., closing pay gaps associated with target groups such as women and racial minorities) and equitable representation (i.e., ensuring these target groups are fairly represented across a firm’s hierarchy). We use formal modeling and simulations to show how efforts to close pay gaps across multiple groups can undermine equitable representation. Specifically, our analysis suggests that pressure for pay equity creates a cost-based financial incentive to enact a subtle form of tokenism: A firm may minimize the cost of closing pay gaps if it maintains a workforce with a small number of minority women whom it pays well in order to compensate for underpaying larger numbers of majority women and minority men who resemble each other in terms of job attributes and personal qualifications. A firm can avoid these outcomes if it focuses on ensuring that employees from target groups are equitably rewarded for job attributes and personal qualifications rather than minimizing cost. But an equitable-rewards approach can be substantially more expensive than a cost-minimization approach, especially if pay gaps are larger in high-wage jobs or if there are many target groups. We conclude by offering testable empirical predictions and recommending a practical solution, namely to include terms for intersectional categories (e.g., minority women) in the regressions used to estimate pay gaps.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18306 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recordkeepers in defined contribution (DC) pension plans are often paid indirectly in the form of revenue sharing from third-party funds on the menu. We show that these arrangements affect the investment menu of 401(k) plans. Revenue-sharing funds are more likely to be added to the menu and are less likely to be deleted. Overall, revenue-sharing plans are more expensive, as higher expense ratios are not offset by lower direct fees or by superior performance. Rebates increase with the market power of the recordkeeper, suggesting that third-party funds may share revenues to gain access to retirement assets.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: The research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the TIAA-CREF Institute through the Pension Research Council/Boettner Center (PRC) of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01560 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper, inspired by a collaboration with a leading consumer electronics retailer in the Middle East, explores the challenge of demand learning and pricing using separable demand models. The data scarcity issue, characterized by limited price changes and low sales volumes, renders traditional models ineffective in deriving reasonable price elasticity. To address this issue, we advocate a separable model that leverages two submodels to distinctly capture the effects of price and contextual information. The separable structure enables us to invest special emphasis on the role of price and impose specific structural assumptions on the submodel for pricing effects, such as the monotone decreasing property. Theoretical analysis sheds light on the statistical complexity of demand learning with the separable structure, highlighting its capacity to reduce the necessary sample size to achieve a desired level of accuracy. We also introduce a computationally efficient iterative algorithm for deriving submodels from offline datasets, complete with convergence guarantees. In an empirical context, we demonstrate how our method can yield meaningful price elasticity estimations and revenue increase based on real sales data from the retailer.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Political Heterogeneity and Societal Polarization Impair Individual Performance: Evidence from Random Assignment in Professional Golf</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how political heterogeneity in groups affects individual performance in settings where people work alongside others. Leveraging the random assignment of golfers to groups in Professional Golfers’ Association Tour tournaments, we find that golfers score 0.2 strokes better per round when playing in politically homogeneous versus heterogeneous groups. This corresponds to a five-rank improvement before the tournament cut and an additional $13,000–$23,400 in tournament earnings. The effect intensifies during periods of high societal political polarization and diminishes when polarization is low. We propose that politically heterogeneous groups create a more stressful and less psychologically safe environment, reducing focus and leading to reduced performance. Consistent with this mechanism, analyses of shot-level data reveal that this effect is strongest during driving and putting shots when players are in close physical proximity. Our study contributes to the understanding of how political heterogeneity in groups affects individual performance in competitive settings, with implications for managing ideological differences in organizations.This paper was accepted by Sameer Srivastava, organizations.Funding: The authors appreciate financial help from Yale University and Fox International [fellowship].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01798 .</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Information Exchange Within Groups: The Role of Voting Protocols in U.S. Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complex and important decisions are often made with advice from a committee of experts. But how do a committee’s “rules of engagement” affect the way individuals discuss, how they vote, and ultimately the quality of their collective recommendation? Compiling verbatim transcripts from U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meetings, we study how a 2007 switch from sequential to simultaneous voting procedures changed discussions, information exchange, and decision making. Consistent with past findings, we show that, compared with a sequential voting protocol, simultaneous voting led to a reduction in the likelihood of unanimous votes. Importantly, we show novel evidence that the majority of this reduction in unanimity was mediated by changes in discussion patterns—specifically, by the increased diversity of information surfaced during discussions. We also find evidence of behavioral and linguistic changes that support our theory that voting protocols changed the incentives for members to elicit more diverse information from each other: under simultaneous voting, members exhibited greater equality in talking time, directed a greater proportion of questions to each other, and adopted language that was more positive, authentic, and equal in projecting status and confidence. Finally, we show that recommendations under simultaneous voting were more likely to be accurate, as drugs recommended and approved were less likely to encounter safety-related postmarket events. In sum, voting protocols affect the incentives for individuals to engage in robust discussions, leading to marked improvements in how information is exchanged between individuals, and in the process by which groups of experts arrive at joint recommendations.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03649 .</content>

    <title>The Competitive Ratio of Threshold Policies for Online Unit-Density Knapsack Problems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a wholesale supply chain ordering problem. In this problem, the supplier has an initial stock and faces an unpredictable stream of incoming orders, making real-time decisions on whether to accept or reject each order. What makes this wholesale supply chain ordering problem special is its knapsack constraint; that is, we do not allow partially accepting an order or splitting an order. The objective is to maximize the utilized stock. We model this wholesale supply chain ordering problem as an online unit-density knapsack problem. We study randomized threshold algorithms that accept an item as long as its size exceeds the threshold. We derive two optimal threshold distributions, the first is 0.4324-competitive relative to the optimal off-line integral packing, and the second is 0.4285-competitive relative to the optimal off-line fractional packing. Both results require optimizing the cumulative distribution function of the random threshold, which are challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problems. We also consider the generalization to multiple knapsacks, in which an arriving item has a different size in each knapsack. We derive a 0.2142-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem cannot be more than 0.4605-competitive. This is the first upper bound strictly less than 0.5, which implies the intrinsic challenge of the knapsack constraint. We show how to naturally implement our optimal threshold distributions in the warehouses of a Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on its order data that demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology–Accenture Alliance for Business Analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01577 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article explores the important but understudied topic of authenticity in investment evaluations. Building on research in authenticity and signaling theory, we theorize how visual first impressions, such as clothing, can generate perceptions of authenticity that lead investors to overlook later quality signals, including a lack of prior experience. We found support for our theory in two field studies and a randomized experiment: investors tend to perceive entrepreneurs who are casually dressed as more authentic than those formally dressed, which is associated with higher investor evaluations. Moreover, perceptions of authenticity generated by casual clothes crowd out later signals: Casually dressed entrepreneurs are evaluated highly regardless of their entrepreneurial experience, but formally dressed entrepreneurs are penalized for perceived inexperience. We discuss the implications of our findings for authenticity research, the temporal order of signals, and early-stage investments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents new stylized facts about returns and cashflow growth rates on stocks and housing over decade‐long holding periods. While cashflow growth rates on the two assets comove positively, their returns comove negatively until the Global Financial Crisis and positively thereafter. These facts present a puzzle for representative‐agent models that imply positive return comovement for assets with similar cashflows. I consider a heterogeneous‐agent model with segmented stock and housing markets connected through credit. News about the aggregate economy generates negative return comovement. Recent shifts such as wealthier homebuyers and institutional housing purchases reduce the importance of credit and segmentation.</content>

    <title>To Own or to Rent? The Effects of Transaction Taxes on Housing Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using sales and leasing data, this paper finds three novel effects of a higher property transaction tax: higher buy-to-rent transactions alongside lower buy-to-own transactions despite both being taxed, a lower sales-to-leases ratio, and a lower price-to-rent ratio. This paper explains these facts by developing a search model with entry of investors and households, households choosing to own or rent in the presence of credit frictions, and homeowners deciding when to move house. A higher transaction tax reduces homeowners’ mobility and increases demand for rental properties, which explains the empirical facts and leads to a lower homeownership rate. The deadweight loss is large at 111% of tax revenue, with more than half of this due to distorting decisions to own or rent.</content>

    <title>Conceptual and Theoretical Perspectives on the Human Resource Management–Leadership–Well‐Being Link: Reviewing 20 Years of Empirical Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) practices and leadership (LS) both impact the functioning and experiences of employees at work, or, in other words, their well‐being (WB). Over the last two decades, the body of empirical research on employee WB that considers aspects of HRM and LS has been growing. There is a myriad of theoretical perspectives, such as job resource theories, social exchange theory, and HRM theories, that can serve as the foundation for empirical inquiry. In addition, the interplay between HRM and LS in impacting employee WB can be conceptualized in many different ways, for example, parallel effects, moderation, and mediation. This literature review takes stock of two decades of empirical HRM–LS–WB research, examines its theoretical and conceptual assumptions, and its temporal developments. We find that the field views the link between HRM, LS, and WB predominantly as an exchange between employee and employer, has a strong tendency to combine social exchange theory with other theoretical frameworks, and is shifting to theories that place the employees at the center of inquiry (e.g., motivational theories). In terms of the interplay between HRM, LS, and WB, we observe a shift toward conceptualizations that focus on the enabling potential of LS and HRM for each other as well as models that focus on the indirect—rather than direct—effects of HRM and LS on WB. We discuss the findings and implications for future research.</content>

    <title>The Devil is in the Details: Zooming out in Leadership Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leadership research has evolved towards increasing conceptual and methodological precision, yielding refined constructs and robust empirical insights. However, this editorial argues that a singular focus on precision risks fragmenting the field and distancing scholarship from the complex realities of organizational life. Drawing on contributions fromJMS, this thematic collection illustrates how leadership is a dynamic, contextually embedded phenomenon shaped by interdependent forces. By ‘zooming out’, scholarship can better reflect the messy, adaptive nature of leadership and offer more actionable insights for leaders navigating today’s organizational challenges. We propose a multidimensional framework – breadth, depth, and height – to reintroduce complexity into leadership studies. Breadth captures the diversity of leadership styles and disciplinary perspectives; depth explores the psychological, symbolic, and relational undercurrents of those diverse perspectives; and height examines how diverse perspectives play out differently across hierarchical levels and systems.</content>

    <title>Clashing Climates: How (In)Congruence Between Information Security Climate and Other Organizational Climates Affects Security Policy Compliance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Securing information assets against cyber-attacks requires organizations to bolster employees’ security behaviors, including compliance with information security policies (ISPs). A strong information security climate (ISC) has been found to be a powerful determinant of such behaviors. However, ISC does not exist in isolation, and its effect on ISP compliance can be impacted by other (in)congruent organizational climates that co-exist within an organization, as simultaneously perceived by employees. Drawing on the competing values framework, this research investigates the joint influences of ISC and co-existing climates on ISP compliance. Specifically, we analyze the interplay between ISC and other co-existing climates, considering their complementary or competing nature, and the extent to which employees perceive these climates to have similar (i.e., aligned) or discrepant (i.e., misaligned) magnitudes of intensity within the organization. Using polynomial regression and response surface analysis, we examine how each (mis)aligned condition is associated with ISP compliance. The results highlight the interplay of ISC with co-existing climates and provide nuanced insights into complex and non-linear relationships among these climates.</content>

    <title>From wells to windmills: Resource redeployment and new technology investment in the energy sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how multi‐business firms redeploy resources following an industry shock. Using the case of oil and gas firms diversified into wind power, I show that firms reduced expenditure in oil and gas—particularly on complex offshore projects—while increasing investment in wind after the 2014 oil price crash. These investments tended to involve newer, more powerful technologies (turbines) when co‐located with existing offshore oil and gas assets. The study provides detailed empirical evidence of resource redeployment and documents conditions under which firms shifted away from one industry and pursued more demanding projects in another. The findings underscore the role of asset colocation in shaping redeployment patterns. They also highlight that market‐based inducements may not be sufficient in driving the energy transition.Managerial SummaryHow should firms respond when a core industry experiences a downturn? This study shows that multi‐business firms—specifically oil and gas companies diversified into wind power—responded to the 2014 oil price crash by cutting investment in oil and gas, especially in offshore projects, and increasing investment in wind power. Importantly, firms were more likely to invest in newer, higher‐capacity wind technologies when they could co‐locate these with existing offshore oil and gas assets. These findings suggest that firms facing industry shocks can redeploy resources into more promising sectors, but their propensity to do so may depend on the possibility of leveraging existing assets across domains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), Chinese cities witnessed a paradox: residential land and new house prices surged while transaction volumes plummeted. We attribute this to local governments’ active price management through supply controls, land acquisitions by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), and limits on new home sales permits. Cities more dependent on land sales and land-backed debt before the pandemic experienced greater price increases and price–volume divergence, with LGFVs buying more land at higher prices than other buyers. These interventions helped sustain fiscal financing but deepened developers’ financial distress, revealing unintended consequences of local governments’ fiscal strategies during downturns.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Is It Beneficial to Recommend Differently Priced Products? Experimental Evidence from Online Recommender Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conventional item-based collaborative filtering recommender systems display recommended products (RPs) on a focal product’s (FP’s) page based on their co-views and co-purchases, but do not explicitly consider their price differences. While the latitude of price acceptance theory suggests that consumers may avoid purchasing products with significantly different prices from their reference prices, the effect of displaying differently priced RP on the FP’s page remains unclear. On the one hand, consumers may notice the price difference between the RP and FP more because of their joint display on the FP’s page due to distinction bias. On the other hand, consumers may infer the relationship between RP and FP from other consumers’ choices in collaborative filtering recommendation systems (observational learning), reducing the salience of their price differences. We examine the impact of price differences between the RP and FP on product sales using a randomized field experiment on a US apparel retailer’s website. We find that recommending a differently priced RP on the FP’s page reduces its purchase probability by 21 percent. The effect of price differences is more pronounced for closely related products, indicating that consumers are less likely to view and purchase differently priced RPs when they are closely related to the FP. Our estimates also reveal an asymmetric effect when the RP price is lower versus higher than the FP price. Since price differences between the FP and RP were not randomly assigned in our field experiment, we validate our results by exogenously varying the price differences of RPs on FPs’ pages in an online experiment on Amazon MTurk. The retailer could gain an additional four percent in total product sales by replacing differently priced recommendations with similarly priced ones, as per the causal forest. Our findings provide implications for online sales strategies and recommender system design.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Robust Pricing with Asymmetric Distributional Information in Valuation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a distributionally robust pricing model aimed at maximizing the worst-case profit under limited knowledge of consumers’ valuation distribution. In addition to mean and variance, we incorporate asymmetric distributional information through semivariance, and then explore the robust optimal posted and randomized pricing strategy. We obtain the robust posted price and show that several series of asymptotic three-point distributions can approach the worst case gradually. The inclusion of asymmetry enables sellers to design three distinct pricing strategies, each corresponding to a different level of asymmetry with explicitly defined thresholds. For the randomized pricing problem, we derive a near-optimal strategy by identifying three key pricing candidates. To avoid the complexity of implementing the optimal randomized price, we also explore a compromise strategy that employs a finite set of pricing candidates, which we formulate as a second-order cone program. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence highlighting the advantages of incorporating asymmetric distributional information over the mean-variance approach, from both the worst-case profit and actual profit perspectives. Our numerical experiments also reveal that posted pricing is more effective for low-cost products, while randomized pricing is preferable for higher-cost items.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Distributionally Robust Dynamic Resource Provisioning under Service Level Agreement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a dynamic resource provisioning problem for a supplier in which the availability of the provisioned resource is subject to random disruptions whose distribution is only indirectly observable through samples. To signal its commitment to service quality, the supplier adopts a service level agreement contract that specifies both the target service level and the associated penalty for violation over a finite contract period. The supplier needs to dynamically determine resource provisioning decisions with the objective of minimizing operational costs and penalties incurred due to service level agreement violations. We construct a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust dynamic programming framework to model and solve the dynamic resource provisioning problem under a service level agreement. In particular, we provide a convexification algorithm that enables us to solve the nonconvex robust dynamic programming problem in a backward manner. We further examine a special case where service shortages depend linearly on the provisioned resources, enabling the problem to be reformulated into a sequence of linear programs. This linear shortage model naturally connects to residual-based robust formulations, which facilitate us to accommodate nonlinear relationships between resource provisioning and service shortages. We propose several approximation algorithms to improve computational efficiency. To mitigate the possibly over-conservativeness, we explore radius adjustment strategies based on sample size, state, stage, and cumulative cost information, which yield consistent out-of-sample performance. We perform a case study of a cloud computing example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach and elicit managerial insights. The results suggest that suppliers should provide fewer backup servers when cumulative downtime is low or when approaching the end of the planning horizon. The dynamic resource provisioning policy significantly reduces the total cost compared to the best static policy. Furthermore, applying appropriate radius adjustments can further enhance the out-of-sample performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Staffing and Treatment for Collaborative Care of Diabetes and Depression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;About 27% of patients with diabetes also suffer from depression, and the presence of co-morbid depression could increase the cost of care for diabetes by up to 100%. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that physical and mental health are more likely to improve for diabetes patients suffering from depression when regular treatment for depression is provided in a primary care setting (called Collaborative Care). However, Collaborative Care requires additional resource utilization costs and a separate reimbursement model. When managing Collaborative Care, clinics must balance patient health outcomes with the program’s financial sustainability. Important operational levers in Collaborative Care are allocating care managers’ time to patients based on their requirements and the care managers’ staffing level. This staffing and workload allocation influences the revenue, costs, and patient health outcomes. We present a novel Markov Dynamic Programming model that, unlike existing approaches, jointly optimizes both staffing levels and treatment policies for Collaborative Care programs and quantifies the costs and benefits of collaborative care. Mathematically, we model Collaborative Care management at the clinical level as an infinite-horizon Markov Dynamic Program. The objective is a weighted sum of total patient QALYs and the clinic profits. The model incorporates insurance payment, resource utilization costs, and disease progression of co-morbid diabetes and depression. We derive structural properties for the joint optimization of the staffing level and allocating care managers’ time to different patient categories. Using these structural properties, we develop a practical and easy-to-implement policy for staffing level and care managers’ time allocation that performs close to the optimal solution. We calibrate the model with data from a large academic medical center and show that our solutions can improve total QALYs and clinic profits compared to current practices. Our analysis also reveals key insights into payment models’ effects on Collaborative Care. Profit under the fixed-fee model responds non-monotonically to payment rate increases, highlighting complex financial dynamics. Fixed-fee models show a threshold behavior, with high-intensity treatments becoming optimal only above certain payment rates. This threshold varies based on the profit-QALY weight balance, and this threshold is lower under joint-optimization than treatment-only optimization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate economic immunity to the COVID-19 pandemic accorded by a sector’s exposure to AI. Using an event study design, we causally estimate the impact of AI industry exposure (AIIE) on shifts in economic activity following the first pandemic-induced lockdown in India. We use payments data from one of India’s largest payment gateways and find that a one-standard-deviation increase in AIIE arrests the post-pandemic decline in industry payments by a third. High AIIE of neighboring sectors further improves a sector’s economic resilience, emphasizing the importance of supply chain partners in technology adoption and change. Further analyses speak to the mechanisms underlying the documented impact of AI on economic activity. Notably, we present evidence suggesting that the observed effects of AI are distinct from those attributable to IT investments or digitization, that AI investments are associated with superior information capabilities prior to the pandemic that arguably enabled agility and responsiveness, and that AI-enabled adaptation occurs in a manner that complements labor rather than displacing it. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of the assessment of the business value of AI and management of disruptions associated with crises events.</content>

    <title>How a Rotten Apple May Spoil the Barrel: Corporate Fraud Detection via Dynamic Business Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate fraud detection is attracting renewed research interest in the era of Internet connectivity due to its increasing complexity, concealment, and long-term duration. Previous fraud detection methods have heavily relied on financial statements and demonstrated limited detection power. While network analysis has emerged as a promising technique, its full potential in corporate fraud detection remains largely untapped, thus missing out on the potential improvement of fraud detection power. Recognizing this significant research gap, we devise a novel framework named as NetDetect to jointly learn structural information and temporal changes in dynamic heterogeneous networks for effective and interpretable corporate fraud detection. NetDetect consists of two new modules—meta-path-based static network feature extraction (SNFE) and temporal network feature extraction (TemFE). We rigorously evaluate each module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art baselines using a unique dataset of Chinese listed companies with a 561K node network. Experiment results and a case study demonstrate that our framework can detect corporate fraud more accurately compared to baselines and offer good early-warning capability as well as results interpretability. Our research results have important implications for various stakeholders (e.g., auditors, investors, and regulators) to understand and contain corporate fraud risk. We also discuss contributions to the IS knowledge base with three design principles to guide the development of similar IT artifacts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the optimal boundary for open data in an economy where financial and real-sector participants access both open and private data. The distinctive features of open access and nonrivalrous usage of open data enable its dual roles as a public information source and innovation input but raise privacy concerns. Our model reveals a novel tradeoff: Although enhanced private data precision and data skills substitute for open data’s information source role, its ability to amplify innovation benefits (via improved investment efficiency) establishes a crucial complementary relationship. This induces a crowding-in effect on the optimal open data boundary under low uncertainty but a crowding-out effect under high uncertainty. The innovation role of open data further generates nonmonotonic effects, yielding complex nonlinear impacts on market and real efficiency. These findings highlight critical policy tradeoffs in balancing innovation, market efficiency, and privacy in the digital age.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Z.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms often respond to information about investor demand, learned when underwriters build the book to place corporate bonds, by “upsizing” the offering amount. We examine the factors that predict two measures of realized credit supply (oversubscription and yield tightening) and show that the unexpected component of credit supply can explain firms’ upsizing decisions. Because firms’ fundamentals and need for capital are unchanged in the few hours of bookbuilding, upsizing provides a bond-level measure that can be used to study the impact of credit supply on postissuance leverage and investment. Firms use the sizeable additional proceeds to reduce bank debt and increase cash holdings; net increases in leverage are temporary for riskier issuers. Our evidence does not support concerns of overinvestment in periods of accommodative credit markets.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00153 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although maximizing quantiles is intuitively appealing and has an axiomatic foundation, it is difficult to find the optimal portfolio strategy because of time inconsistency. Using an intrapersonal equilibrium approach and focusing on the class of time-varying affine strategies, we find that the only viable outcome is from the median maximization because for other quantiles, either the equilibrium does not exist or there is no investment in risky assets. We also prove that maximizing the median endogenizes the use of portfolio insurance. The calibration of the model uncovers a new empirical phenomenon: “portfolio share smile.”This paper was accepted by Giesecke Kay, finance.Funding: This research was supported by the General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR [Grant 14207620], Early Career Scheme of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR [Grant 25213424], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 12401622], and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [Grant P0042708].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03182 .</content>

    <title>When Do Individuals Believe in Themselves Rather Than in Artificial Intelligence? Insights from Longitudinal Investigations in Corporate Credit‐Rating Contexts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals often prioritize their own judgements rather than heeding the advice of artificial intelligence (AI). This study draws on the literature on anchoring theory and cognitive biases to explore the theoretical mechanisms underlying individuals’ reliance on AI advice and how this reliance affects decision performance. Specifically, we examined situations in which (1) individuals’ knowledge accumulated over time, (2) multiple information sources were available, and (3) AI could emulate users’ decisions. We developed a ‘corporate credit‐rating’ AI system that could provide more accurate advice than users. We then conducted two main longitudinal studies and four supplementary ones – six in total – with each study comprising three sessions. Our findings demonstrated that individuals’ initial estimates became more similar to AI advice over time. As the difference between individuals’ initial estimates and AI advice increased, individuals were more inclined to revise their initial judgements but showed lower relative dependence on AI. This effect, however, depended on the individuals’ experience in decision‐making. Additionally, introducing additional information reduced the similarity between the initial estimate and AI advice, but the proximity of additional information to AI advice facilitated individuals’ adjustment to the advice. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results.</content>

    <title>Beyond the front page: In‐text citations to patents as traces of inventor knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces in‐text patent‐to‐patent citations—references embedded in the body of patent documents—as a novel data source to trace knowledge flows. Unlike front‐page citations, which often reflect legal requirements, in‐text citations are more likely to originate from inventors and signal meaningful technological linkages. We show that they exhibit stronger geographic and semantic proximity, greater self‐referentiality, and closer alignment with inventor knowledge. Though less frequent than front‐page citations, they yield robust results in models of knowledge diffusion. We release a validated dataset and reproducible code to support future research. Our findings offer new opportunities for scholars interested in the microfoundations of innovation, the geography of knowledge flows, and the role of inventors in shaping firms' knowledge trajectories.Managerial SummaryThis study introduces in‐text patent citations—references embedded in the technical description of patent documents—as a new way to trace how knowledge flows among inventors and firms. Unlike traditional front‐page citations, which often reflect legal formalities or examiner input, in‐text citations originate more directly from inventors and thus capture genuine technological linkages. Using large‐scale U.S. patent data, we show that in‐text citations connect geographically and thematically closer inventions and are more likely to involve the same firms or inventors. The dataset, released as open data, enables more accurate analyses of innovation dynamics and firm knowledge strategies. Managers can use these insights to better understand how ideas diffuse and where valuable inventive knowledge resides.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a significant yet underappreciated effect of IPR implementation: the dissemination after TRIPS implementation of established scientific knowledge from low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) into the global scientific system of pharmaceutical development. The staggered implementation of the policy allows identification of increased diffusion of pre‐existing LMIC knowledge on global diseases into the global corporate invention pipeline. For neglected diseases, the uptake remains in academic science. Other results demonstrate institutional effects in the scientific communities in LMICs through increases in scientific productivity, cross‐border collaborations, and scientist mobility. These and other results recast TRIPS’ impact as sensitive to the incentives of global corporations and institutionally significant for LMICs. We discuss implications for research on innovation strategy.Managerial SummaryThe implementation in an LMIC of an intellectual‐property system (e.g., of patents) carries implications for dissemination of pre‐existing scientific knowledge from the implementing country into the global scientific system. Corporate invention more intensively incorporates pre‐existing LMIC knowledge when the subject is global diseases such as cardiovascular conditions and cancer. However, when the subject is neglected diseases such as infectious conditions, the significant uptake remains in academic science. Overall, this research suggests that the implementation of patent and other intellectual‐property protections influences the integration of LMIC science into the global system differentially based on the relevance for global commercialization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research has revealed that return spreads between stocks with high and low characteristics-based factor beta remain insignificant. This study investigates the time variation in the pricing of various characteristics-based factors, uncovering a notable two-regime pattern: high-beta portfolios yield higher returns than low-beta portfolios after high-sentiment periods, while the opposite occurs after low-sentiment periods. Remarkably, this two-regime pattern is completely reversed for macro factors. Mutual fund and hedge fund returns corroborate these findings. Our results suggest that exposure to characteristics-based factors likely represents mispricing levels, particularly during high-sentiment periods, whereas exposure to macro factors likely represents risk, particularly during low-sentiment periods.</content>

    <title>A Selfless Integrator or a Selfish Quasi‐Professional? Relational Tactics for Organizational Professionals’ Durable Influence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study works towards a ‘sociology of organizational professionals’ by elucidating how they navigate domains dominated by occupational professionals. It shows that relational tactics impact whether organizational professionals remain limited to a periphery, become subservient to occupational professionals, or achieve durable roles. Drawing on qualitative data from 12 Italian hospitals, we analyse how quality managers enact relational strategies towards executives and senior clinicians in the context of integrated care. We identify four configurations of tactics with distinct role outcomes. Tactics focused only on executives (transparent knowledge sharing, subordinate activation) yield no role enhancement. Tactics directed only at occupational professionals (transparent knowledge sharing, rapid relational engagement) render quality managers subservient to occupational professionals. Tactics simultaneously aimed at executives and occupational professionals enhance the role in a durable way. Such tactics may follow a ‘selfless’ approach (rapid relationality, subordinate activation, transparent knowledge sharing), which enables quality managers to expand their role across domains, becoming itinerant integrators; or a ‘selfish’ quasi‐professional approach (rapid reciprocity, consultant activation, opaque knowledge sharing), which enables quality managers to enrich their role, becoming stable niche service providers. We offer new insights into how organizational professionals negotiate authority, influence, and mobility within established professional hierarchies through relational strategies.</content>

    <title>Between Human and System Agency: Coping with Negative Incidents for Continued Effective Use of Wearables</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wearable devices hold significant promise for promoting healthy behaviors, yet they often fall short of this potential when users disengage or use them ineffectively. This research examines how individuals respond to negative incidents—such as frustrating feedback, misaligned goals, or perceived surveillance—and how these responses influence continued effective use. Effective use means interacting with the wearable in ways that help achieve health-related goals, beyond merely logging steps or checking data. Based on in-depth accounts from long-term users, the study reveals that, although some cope by re-engaging with the technology, others manipulate data, disengage, or selectively avoid features, undermining the benefits wearables are meant to deliver. Crucially, sustained effective use depends not just on motivation or usability but on the alignment between human and system agency. When wearables assert their own logic too strongly or misalign with user goals, maladaptive responses are more likely. These findings offer actionable guidance for designers, healthcare providers, and policymakers: Rather than focusing solely on adoption or persuasive design, efforts should support user autonomy and recovery after setbacks. Wearables that accommodate breakdowns and empower users in the face of friction are more likely to sustain engagement and improve long-term health outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship scholarship faces challenges related to diverse populations, striving to balance inclusivity with the recognition of unique entrepreneurial identities. Applying optimal distinctiveness theory, we explore the relationship between belongingness and uniqueness in entrepreneurship research. Catalyzed by Bakker and McMullen’s 2023 article on inclusivity in entrepreneurship, we utilized natural language processing to examine responses about inclusive entrepreneurship from 29 scholars dedicated to marginalized populations. Findings suggest that employing varied research methods and integrating structural and epistemological considerations can enhance our understanding of entrepreneurial heterogeneity. We advocate for entrepreneurship research that values individual experiences while promoting inclusive practices, highlighting the need for evolving scholarly paradigms to reflect entrepreneurial differences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on the strategic entrepreneurship perspective and upper echelon theory, we examine the importance of private equity (PE) functional human capital and socio-demographic diversity for the success of the acquisitive growth strategy. Our focus is on the buyout lead partner team rather than on human capital at the collective PE firm (or fund) level. The results of our panel data survival models suggest that gender and age diversity, as well as the financial background, significantly accelerate both first and subsequent add-on acquisitions. The results are robust to alternative proxies, model specifications, and endogeneity checks.JEL Codes:G24, G34, J10, L26</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New forms of shared micromobility services, such as electric scooters (i.e., e-scooters) are growing rapidly across cities. However, their impact beyond the retail and restaurant sectors is less understood in the marketing literature. We examine how the entry of e-scooters impacts other incumbent shared mobility services (i.e., ridesharing and bikesharing) and consumer safety (i.e., crimes) using data on the entry of e-scooters in parts of Chicago in 2019 and a generalized synthetic control approach. We propose and test novel mechanisms based on e-scooters’ effects on overall demand and modal relationships (i.e., complementarity vs. substitution) with ridesharing and bikesharing. The results from our analysis show that the entry of e-scooters increases the number of short rideshare trips by 15.72%, but decreases the number of bikeshare trips by 7.62%. The effects are consistent with acategory expansionmechanism for ridesharing (i.e., increase in the demand for trips met by complementarities between e-scooters and ridesharing) and acategory cannibalizationmechanism for bikesharing (i.e., increase in the demand for trips met by substitution of bikesharing by e-scooters). Interestingly, we also find that the entry of e-scooters increases the number of crimes (e.g., vehicle break-ins) by 17.94%, mostly due to street and vehicle crimes. The effects of e-scooters are heterogeneous by the age and racial composition of a neighborhood. Overall, e-scooters contribute about $8.1 million in ridesharing revenues but they also have an unintended negative environmental effect amounting to over 800 metric ton carbon emissions per year. Our research offers anapp companionfor stakeholders.</content>

    <title>It’s All About Me (Or Is It Us?): The Narrative Antecedents of the Locus of Celebrity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For two decades, research on individual and organizational celebrity has flourished. However, the literature remains limited in several ways. First, despite recent gains regarding the antecedents of celebrity, current theory does not fully explain why celebrity resides at a specific locus (i.e., at the individual‐ and/or organizational level). Second, research has suggested that both the media and organizations play significant roles in celebrity attainment. However, researchers have focused more on the media’s role in creating celebrity narratives and less on the role that organizational communications play in the narrative process and how they affect the locus of celebrity. Lastly, research has provided a fragmented picture of individual and organizational celebrity, disregarding that organizations and their leaders can share high degrees of positive attention (i.e., have concurrent celebrity) that likely have different effects than celebrity located at only one locus. We address these issues by integrating celebrity research across multiple loci to develop a theory of the narrative antecedents of the locus of celebrity. In doing so, we explain how organizations can actively create individual, organizational, or concurrent celebrity.</content>

    <title>Chat More and Contribute Better: An Empirical Study of a Knowledge-Sharing Community</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge-sharing communities face a dual challenge: they must enable efficient content generation and also provide spaces in which interpersonal bonds can form. We examine how these goals interact by studying Stack Overflow’s introduction of informal chat rooms alongside its main question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) forum. Using a difference-in-differences design, we analyze two sequential shocks: the launch of chat rooms and the later addition of automated feeds that pushed Q&amp;A content into chat rooms, thus creating a bridging mechanism between the two spaces. We find that, on their own, the introduction of chat rooms leads to no improvement in knowledge exchange for average users in the community. However, we find evidence that chat rooms may forge a closed subgroup of users, who tend to primarily help each other by answering questions within the group, and the benefits are isolated to the subgroup. The activation of an automated feeding function that pushes all questions into the chat room expands benefits beyond the closed subgroup. Our results show that platform designers should consider not only how to foster subgroup cohesion, but also how to facilitate bridging between interactions in the subgroups and the broader community.PRESS BLURBA new study of Stack Overflow shows that adding informal chat rooms can deepen engagement among certain members but risks creating exclusive circles. When paired with bridging tools, such as automated feeds that connect chat rooms and Q&amp;A forums, response times improved and benefits reached a wider set of users. The findings highlight how platform design choices can shape inclusivity, efficiency, and knowledge exchange in online communities.Social Media blurb:Study shows that pairing informal chat rooms with bridging tools such as feeds can enhance both engagement and inclusivity in online communities.Alternatives: 🧩 Chat rooms foster bonds; feeds build bridges: how design choices shape knowledge sharing in online communities. ⚡ Adding bridges such as feeds makes online communities faster, fairer, and more inclusive—lessons from Stack Overflow. 🌐 Efficient answers + human connection: why balancing chat rooms and bridging tools matters for knowledge platforms.</content>

    <title>How Can Firms Enhance Perceptions of Return‐to‐Office When Restricting Autonomy Over Where Work Occurs?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As return‐to‐office (RTO) policies grow in popularity, firms are struggling to quell resistance from employees—especially since RTO policies inherently restrict autonomy over where work occurs. Integrating HRM system strength and signaling theory with our critique that firms are often depicted as far more passive in the work‐life flexibility literature than they are in practice, we theorize a process of RTO conversion as to how firms address the recoil effect they create (i.e., employee resistance) when introducing RTO. We conceptualize employees' perceptions of RTO as a continuum ranging from “employer‐friendly” (low) to “employee‐friendly” (high) based on the extent to which firms consider and rectify how on‐site requirements misalign with employees' preferences for autonomy over where work occurs. Our work underscores the complexity of how RTO unfolds in practice, involving ongoing, dynamic efforts across multiple business functions to convert and sustain perceptions of RTO as employee‐friendly. A core theme throughout is that an emphasis on quality of work life—specifically, enhancing the physical and psychosocial features of the workplace to improve employees' extrinsic and intrinsic on‐site experiences—functions as a potentially viablesubstitutefor autonomy over where work occurs. We also discuss implications for CEOs, HR leaders, strategy, policies, and practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a new database of banking-crisis interventions, covering 1,946 interventions in 20 categories across 143 countries. We demonstrate that crisis-intervention patterns are significantly related to income and fiscal variables and to measures of the political system and currency regime. GDP losses following crises are economically significant and are larger for wealthier countries, with some evidence that these losses are mitigated by democratic political systems and liberal currency regimes. Finally, intervention frequencies reached an apex during the post–Bretton Woods era, continuing a secular increase since at least the late seventeenth century. (JEL G01, E60, N20)</content>

    <title>Smart Navigation Via Strategic Communications in a Mixed Autonomous Paradigm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm in cobotic order picking operations, we investigate the optimal information design to navigate human workers (HWs) who cooperate with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within an intralogistics system. We incorporate asymmetric information between AMRs and HWs in a routing game where connected AMRs are informed of the congestion state while HWs rely on information provided by the system. The system designs a communication policy aiming to navigate HWs away from congestion. Without strategic communications, we show that the deployment of AMRs cannot mitigate congestion unless the automation level reaches a threshold. Interestingly, we illustrate a substitution effect between automation and strategic communications when information distortion is mild. In contrast, severe information distortion complements automation due to exacerbated congestion. Furthermore, an in‐house AMR fleet is economically more efficient than a third‐party logistics service. Consequently, in‐house automation can be achieved with mild information distortion, while severe information distortion is required to complement the lack of efficiency in the third‐party AMR fleet. With simulated numerical examples to complement the analytical results, we provide managerial insights concerning the optimal information policies under different levels of automation, guiding warehouse managers in their communications with workers to achieve the best performance of the cobotic system.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by a realworld practice of a China Post sortation center, this study considers the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve the efficiency of a human–robot hybrid sortation system. In this system, IoT technology enables responsive adjustment of the manual capacity to alleviate the congestion effect of increasing parcel flow on robotic sorting efficiency. We begin with a predictive analysis of a real‐life dataset to quantify the congestion effect on robotic sorting efficiency, and examine the nonstationary behavior of the parcel flow process. Subsequently, we design an online algorithm using IoT advance information (which refers to advance observation of some parcel flows before their actual arrivals) for efficiently adjusting the manual capacity. We develop theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of the online algorithm by bounding its regret, and also demonstrate that the long‐term expected regret rate is zero under mild conditions. Via extensive simulation experiments, we find that our online algorithm outperforms the China Post sortation center's current policy and conventional Markov dynamic program in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality. The simulation results also demonstrate that the value of IoT technology to the sortation center can be significant, and shed insights on IoT investment by revealing the diminishing return of expanding the horizon of IoT advance information.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Hidden Impact of Prosumers and Its Fair Mitigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the burgeoning trend of prosumers, who have transformed from traditional consumers into active renewable energy producers. While prosumers help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, they often remain connected to the grid as a backup. This practice requires that utility companies reserve capacity, and conventional consumers share these associated costs. We develop a stylized model to comprehensively assess the impact of prosumers. Our findings demonstrate that, although prosumers contribute to diminishing non-renewable energy consumption and offer potential cost savings to utility firms, they simultaneously introduce negative externalities. Specifically, they inject uncertainty into the grid, resulting in higher electricity prices and increased utility bills for regular consumers, even when fixed costs incurred by utility firms are not considered. As the intermittency of prosumer energy generation increases, the socially optimal proportion decreases while the self-selected equilibrium proportion of prosumers increases. Furthermore, we examine the potential implications of a conventional linear incentive scheme for prosumers, exemplified by the 2023 U.S. federal tax credit for solar panel installation costs. We find that such schemes may exacerbate social disparity. To address this issue, we propose a reverse-linear subsidization approach, which paradoxically requires less funding to achieve equivalent prosumer adoption rates and results in smaller social disparity.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Scaling Urban On-Demand Delivery: A Dabbawala-Inspired System for Handling Massive Demands via Public Transit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rapid growth of omnichannel retailing and the takeaway delivery economy, the classic point-to-point mode for on-demand delivery is deficient in delivery capacity, coverage area, dispatching efficiency, and courier safety assurance. Inspired by the success of Dabbawala, a historical Indian company for lunch delivery, we propose a novelpublic on-demand delivery service systemthat uses the public transit network to satisfy stochastic delivery demands. In particular, the proposed system includes a radial public transit network for intermediate transshipment, as well as couriers with e-bikes for terminal pick-up and drop-off. Our research aims to generate system design that minimizes the sum of penalty costs from lost sales and operational costs associated with courier terminal delivery distance. Solving the integrated system optimization problem relies on incorporating operational details, especially the allocation strategies of the lines’ capacity and the couriers’ terminal traveling modes. For the former, we propose a novel flexible design, called dual long-chain design, to improve flexibility. For the latter, we propose an elegant approximation of optimal service region partitioning that minimizes the expected terminal delivery distance and the resulting costs, without compromising delivery timeliness. Leveraging the theoretical results of the operational strategies, we simplify the integrated optimization problem and propose an efficient approximation algorithm. Finally, we validate the advantage of the proposed system over classic point-to-point delivery in satisfying demands and reducing costs through extensive numerical experiments, providing managerial insights in handling massive on-demand delivery demands and utilizing the idle capacity of the public transit system.</content>

    <title>Velocity‐Based Stowage Policy for a Semiautomated Fulfillment System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online retail fulfillment is increasingly performed by semiautomated fulfillment systems in which inventory is stored in mobile pods that are moved by robotic drives. In this paper, we develop a model that explores the benefits of velocity‐based stowage policies for semiautomated fulfillment systems, also known as robotic mobile fulfillment systems. The stowage policies decide which pods to replenish with the received inventory. Specifically, we model policies that account for the velocity of the units being stowed. By stowing higher (lower) velocity units on higher (lower) velocity pods, we expect to increase the heterogeneity of the pod velocities. Greater heterogeneity in pod velocities can yield a greater reduction in pod travel distance from velocity‐based storage policies for the pod. Reducing pod travel distance decreases the number of robotic drives that are needed for the system to maintain a certain throughput rate. We analyze anM‐class velocity‐based stowage policy. We stow units from each velocity class onto pods dedicated to that velocity class; each class of pods then has its own storage zone, where the zones are ordered based on the distance to the stationary pick and stow stations. We characterize the pod travel distance as a function of the skewness of the demand distribution and the number and size of the classes. We find that with two or three classes we can achieve most of the benefits possible from a velocity‐based stowage and storage policy. For representative demand distributions, we find that a two‐class policy achieves 75% of the maximum possible travel‐time reduction and that a three‐class policy improves this to 90%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a controlled experiment to show that ability and belief calibration jointly determine the benefits of working with artificial intelligence (AI). AI improves performance more for people with low baseline ability. However, holding ability constant, AI assistance is more valuable for people who are calibrated, meaning they have accurate beliefs about their own ability. People who know they have low ability gain the most from working with AI. In a counterfactual analysis, we show that eliminating miscalibration would cause AI to reduce performance inequality nearly twice as much as it already does.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Alfred P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper experimentally demonstrates that group discussions can serve as an instrument to improve competence calibration, which in turn allows getting more wisdom out of the crowd through competence weighting. While the alignment of individuals’ estimation accuracy and self-perceived competence is typically poor and competence-weighted aggregates do not even match the accuracy of simple averaging, we find that preceding group discussions on unrelated judgment problems enhance competence calibration. Consequently, the subsequent performance of competence-weighted aggregation schemes rises to and beyond prediction market levels, suggesting an easy-to-implement approach for effectively exploiting crowd wisdom.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03061 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Goal failure is an important problem that is costly for both companies and consumers. Consumers often purchase products, subscribe to services, and download apps in support of valued goals, yet fail to use these tools as much as intended. But might the language consumers use to describe such goal failures affect how they subsequently pursue those goals? Nine experiments demonstrate that, compared to saying “didn’thavetime”, saying “didn’tmaketime” increases subsequent motivation. This is driven by perceived control over time. Specifically, saying “didn’t make” (vs. “didn’t have”) time makes consumers feel more in control of their time, which increases their subsequent motivation to reengage with the goal. Notably, such make-time framing has downstream implications for consumer evaluations of goal-related products and services. Further, it can be manipulated directly, as well as through firms’ promotional activities (i.e., featuring make-time language on social media). Importantly, make-time (vs. have-time) framing may be particularly beneficial in the context of goal failure, when consumers are less inclined to adopt this perspective naturally. Together, the findings shed light on how language shapes motivation, deepen understanding of time’s role in goal pursuit, and have important implications for how companies manage consumer goal failure.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research suggests that political affinity between home and host countries can influence the strategic decisions and outcomes of multinational corporations by conferring legitimacy, it often implicitly assumes that this legitimacy transfer occurs automatically. This assumption overlooks the complexity of organizational legitimation. We address this gap by exploring the specific pathways through which political affinity translates into the legitimacy of foreign initial public offering (IPO) firms, a context where overcoming the capital market liability of foreignness is critical. Drawing on the legitimacy perspective, we develop a model that explainshowandwhenpolitical affinity influences the legitimacy and survival of foreign IPO firms in the host‐country stock market. Specifically, we theorize and test a moderated mediation model that demonstrates: (1) the legitimation mechanism (how): political affinity enhances the legitimacy of foreign IPO firms through endorsements by local analysts and alliance partners, thereby reducing their delisting risk and (2) the boundary condition (when): this pathway is more pronounced for firms with stronger external stakeholder orientation. Empirical analyses using a sample of foreign IPO firms in the United States provide general support for our theoretical predictions. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on political affinity and foreign IPO firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bruton et al.’sPointarticle argues that management and organizational scholarship (MOS) pays insufficient attention to context, using entrepreneurship research as their main case. We agree with their call to put institutions and policies at the forefront of MOS scholarship but disagree with their proposed approach and see many weaknesses in their reasoning. But, in thisCounterpoint, we argue that thePointarticle (1) imputes a questionable ‘capitalist’ bias to entrepreneurship research, (2) relies on notions of socialism and capitalism that do not advance entrepreneurship as a discipline, (3) oversimplifies or neglects the variety of real‐world institutional arrangements, (4) misses a large literature on institutions (in MOS and increasingly also in entrepreneurship research), and (5) fails to supply a positive agenda for entrepreneurship research. More generally, we question their interpretation and application of socialism – normally understood as a country‐ or society‐level construct – to organizations and argue that organizational and institutional scholarship already addresses their phenomena of interest. OurCounterpointends with a proposal to advance MOS and entrepreneurship scholarship by focusing on the different forms and outcomes of organizations and entrepreneurship across countries and institutional environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Upfront payments are important financial resources startups seek to negotiate in technology alliances. This study unpacks how venture‐backed startups can benefit from their VC affiliations and obtain better payments. We develop a bargaining framework and argue that VCs can strengthen venture‐backed startups' hand in alliance negotiations through two distinct pathways: (i) by providing a quality signal, and (ii) by serving as conduits of alternative partnering options. We further suggest that these distinct benefits in bargaining hinge on startups' technological quality, which substitutes for the quality signal arising from VC affiliations but complements the VC's intermediation role in markets for partners. The evidence therefore identifies the distinct and complex channels by which VCs can help startups obtain financial resources at nascent stages through their technology alliances.Managerial SummaryUpfront payments in technology alliances are vital revenues for technology startups. This study reveals how venture capital (VC) affiliations strengthen startups' bargaining position and enable them to secure larger payments. VCs add value in startups' alliance negotiations in two key ways: by signaling the quality of the startup's resources and by providing alternative partnering options. The benefits of these mechanisms vary with the startup's technological quality—strong technology can substitute for the VC's quality signal but enhances the value of VC intermediation. Managers should recognize that VCs add value to their ventures beyond financing by also reinforcing their investee startups' bargaining power, helping startups negotiate favorable terms in technology alliances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature on market categories and identities focuses primarily on whether categorical atypicality leads to positive or negative evaluation; however, much less is known about whether the evaluation is accurate or not. While it is important forproducersto know if atypicality is penalized or rewarded,audiencesare also concerned about whether their evaluation of atypical organizations is accurate, as well as how the evaluation can be improved. To shed light on this, we first test the association between categorical atypicality and evaluation accuracy. Distinguishing audiences in two dimensions – coverage coherence and typicality – we further theorize and examine which audiences are better able to evaluate atypical organizations. Analysing earnings forecasts for US firms, we find that analysts’ forecasts for atypical firms are not necessarily inaccurate, contrary to what prior theory would suggest. More importantly, the results show that analysts are more accurate in forecasting atypical firms when their coverages are more atypical and/or incoherent. The findings suggest that atypical and incoherent coverage enables analysts to better understand atypical firms, supporting our core conjecture of ‘unconventional audiences for atypical actors’.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study an intervention by a brokerage firm providing advisory services to high-net-worth investors. In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, that is, a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows financial firms can successfully reduce clients’ biases by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new measure of technological obsolescence using detailed patent data. The measure contains incremental information about firm innovation relative to measures focusing on new innovation. Using this measure, we present two sets of results. First, firms’ technological obsolescence foreshadows substantially lower growth, productivity, and reallocation of capital. This finding mainly applies to obsolescence of core innovation and embodied innovation, and it is stronger in competitive product markets. Second, in stock markets, high-obsolescence firms underperform low-obsolescence firms by 7% annually. Using analyst forecast data, we show this is due to a systematic overestimation of future profits of obsolescent firms. (JEL O3, O4, G1, G3)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have witnessed significant growth in corporate sustainability reporting. Yet existing research provides mixed evidence on the information content of these reports for investors. We examine the stock market reaction to the announcement of a sample of US corporate sustainability reports incorporating Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics that are intended to provide financially material information to investors. Using standard measures of information content, we cannot find compelling evidence that these reports provide a significant amount of new information to investors. Further analysis of a subset of common metrics indicates that they are either financially immaterial or preempted by traditional financial disclosures. Finally, we show that most firms target their sustainability reports at a broad set of sustainability-oriented stakeholders rather than a narrow set of financially oriented investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether narrative discussion in financial disclosures can help corporate stakeholders better predict tax outcomes. To measure qualitative discussion, we use topic modeling analysis to create measures of the thematic content of 10-K disclosures. We find that qualitative discussion in financial disclosures can substantially improve prediction of tax outcomes in in- and out-of-sample tests. We also find that prediction-relevant discussion is distributed throughout the 10-K, supporting that disclosures should be analyzed holistically rather than examining only limited pieces of larger disclosures. Further, we find that analysts often do not use this information effectively, resulting in predictable and economically meaningful forecast errors. These findings illustrate the wealth of qualitative information in 10-K disclosures for stakeholders concerned about tax outcomes and offer a practical approach to examining qualitative disclosures and using them to predict tax outcomes.</content>

We consider two harvesting protocols: the dominant status-quo practice, namely Harvest-all and an alternative, namely Selective Harvesting. In the Harvest-all protocol, workers pick all crop units in the areas assigned to them, regardless of the crops’ size and maturity, resulting in higher productivity but lower average value (quality) of the harvested produce. Workers also remain in demanding physical postures for longer periods of time, resulting in ergonomic stress. In contrast, under the Selective Harvesting protocol, workers take multiple rounds to completely harvest the assigned area, picking in each round only the select crop units that are near their peak monetary value. This results in lower productivity but higher average quality of the harvested produce and better ergonomic conditions. We develop mathematical models to analyze the two harvesting protocols, provide a complete analytical characterization of the optimal managerial decisions under each protocol, and examine how these decisions are influenced by relevant contextual factors. In addition, we characterize the performance of each harvesting protocol along three key performance metrics of interest: firm profitability, worker monetary welfare, and worker ergonomic welfare. Using both analytical and calibrated numerical methods we show that adopting Selective Harvesting over Harvest-all can create win-win scenarios where both the firm and workers are better off. However, our analysis reveals that the firm’s and workers’ interests may not always be fully aligned. We subsequently demonstrate that the misalignment can be reduced by making adjustments to the compensation structure so that workers’ earnings match the maximum potential value while having minimal impact on firm profitability. Our models illustrate the benefits of careful process redesign in creating better working conditions for employees and advancing firms’ social responsibility practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The prophet inequality is a cornerstone of online decision making, comparing a sequential decision maker to a prophet who knows all outcomes in advance. In “Trading Prophets,” J. Correa, A. Cristi, P. Dütting, M. Hajiaghayi, J. Olkowski, and K. Schewior initiate the study of buy-and-sell prophet inequalities. Here, an online algorithm observes a sequence of prices, one after the other, to trade an item. At each time step, the algorithm can decide to buy and pay the current price if it does not already hold the item, or it can decide to sell and collect the current price as a reward if it holds the item. The authors identify settings where a constant-factor approximation to the all-knowing prophet benchmark can be achieved. Interestingly, these conditions differ from those required for standard prophet inequalities. Specifically, they show that no constant-factor inequality exists for arbitrary independent prices. In contrast, they prove that a constant factor is achievable when independent prices arrive in a random order.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Supervision Lifts Rural Weavers’ ProductivityFrequent, predictable supervisor visits can be a powerful lever for boosting artisan productivity in distributed supply chains, according to a study conducted with Jaipur Rugs in India. Analyzing loom-level data, the authors show that reducing the average gap between visits by just one day raises weaving rates by 8.5%—with more substantial gains on complex rugs and when visits follow consistent schedules. Building on these insights, they develop a routing and scheduling framework that targets those looms most in need of support. In a 25-week field implementation covering about 6,000 visits across 200 looms, sites assigned to optimized routes saw a 16.7% increase in weaving speed relative to controls, highlighting a practical, low-cost pathway to higher earnings for rural women weavers. The research suggests that data-driven supervision in other supply chains with a similar structure (e.g., smallholder agriculture) could boost productivity and earnings, offering an operational lever for poverty alleviation at scale.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the empirical evidence observed from the real-world data set, this paper studies context-based dynamic pricing with separable demand models. Consider a seller selling a product over a finite horizon of T periods and facing an unknown expected demand function that admits a separable structure [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] denote the product’s price and features, respectively. The seller does not know the exact expression of [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] but can dynamically adjust prices in each period based on the observed features and demands to learn their forms. The seller’s objective is to maximize the T-period expected revenue. We systematically characterize the statistical complexity of the online learning problem under three configurations of demand models with different structures of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. For each model, we design an efficient online learning algorithm with a provable regret upper bound. We also show that the upper bound is generally unimprovable by proving a matching regret lower bound in certain parameter regimes. Our results reveal fundamental differences in the optimal regret rates when [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are endowed with different structures. The numerical results demonstrate that our learning algorithms are more effective than benchmark algorithms for all the three models and also show the effects of the parameters associated with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] on the algorithm’s empirical regret.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>The Authenticity of Purpose Claims: Firm Capacity and Job Seeker Responses to Recruitment Efforts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whereas corporate purpose involves a claim made to galvanize stakeholders, recent research on the topic has not examined it as a claim. Given the information asymmetry that many evaluators of purpose claims face, a key question concerns the conditions under which they are not simply viewed as cheap talk but are instead perceived as authentic. We argue that the difficulty and future orientation inherent to purpose claims make firm capacity a key source of authenticity and, ultimately, positive evaluations. We examine these ideas in the labor market context, where employers often present purpose claims to job seekers facing information asymmetry. First, we develop and validate a novel measure of purpose claim strength using a combination of topic modeling, dictionary-based validation, and experimental validation. Using this measure, we test our capacity hypothesis with job application field data, using firm size as a proxy for capacity. We find that high-purpose job posts receive approximately 50% more applications than low-purpose job posts when the firm has more than 1,000 employees, but only receive about a 10% increase when the firm has fewer than 50 employees. In a second study, we use vignette experiments to directly test our hypothesized mechanism. We show that, conditional on a strong purpose claim, size manipulations shape capacity perceptions, leading to greater perceived authenticity and increased application likelihood. Next, holding size constant, we show that an affiliation-based manipulation leads to similar results. Our paper helps scholars understand what gives authenticity to purpose claims and helps practitioners understand how they can more effectively communicate purpose.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Funding: This research was supported by funding from the Center for Sustainable Business at the University of Pittsburgh School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03931 .</content>

    <title>Reputation on the Line: How the Third-Party Dilemma Shapes Trust in High-Risk Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite scholars’ increasing acknowledgment of the role third parties can play in others’ trust decisions, we know very little about what motivates these parties’ information sharing. Our research examines this process via a qualitative, inductive study of linemen: the men and women who work on power lines. We show how features of their work context give rise to a strong reliance on third-party information for trust and strong accountability for third parties who share reputational information. These conditions cultivate what we call the “third-party dilemma”: Linemen feel trapped between desires to keep trustors safe and desires to protect their own reputations. We further explain how the information-sharing practices by which they manage this dilemma ultimately affect the trust triad by allowing third parties to partially safeguard their reputations, encouraging trustors to provisionally grant or withhold trust, and subjecting trustees to either sticky negative reputations or fragile positive reputations. These dynamics encourage lower trust within the triad. We conclude by highlighting the importance of the work context in shaping third-party motives, discussing the trust-related implications of how the third-party dilemma is managed, and redirecting trust research beyond dyadic (trustor–trustee) models of trust.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new facts on how convenience yields fluctuate with macroeconomic variables and fiscal policy: the convenience yield of long-term Treasuries is negatively correlated with inflation expectations, and inflation expectations predict future debt-to-GDP growth. To rationalize these findings, we incorporate the convenience yield into a macro-finance model with endogenous fiscal policy. The government finances deficit shocks partially through higher inflation and partially through more future borrowing, which reduces the convenience yield today. The feedback loop between the convenience yield and future debt supply amplifies the effect of fiscal shocks. We further verify this channel using empirically constructed exogenous deficit shocks.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-dated inflation swap contracts provide widely used estimates of expected inflation. We develop methods to estimate complementary tail probabilities for persistently very high or low inflation using inflation options prices. We show that three new adjustments to conventional methods are crucial: inflation, horizon, and risk. We find that: (a) U.S. deflation risk in 2011–2014 has been overstated, (b) ECB unconventional policies lowered deflation disaster probabilities, (c) inflation expectations deanchored in 2021–2022, (d) reanchored as policy tightened, (e) but the 2021–2024 disaster left scars, and (f) U.S. expectations are less sensitive to inflation realizations than in the eurozone.

    <title>Integrated Conditional Estimation-Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many real-world optimization problems involve uncertain parameters with probability distributions that can be estimated using contextual feature information. In contrast to the standard approach of first estimating the distribution of uncertain parameters and then optimizing the objective based on the estimation, we propose an integrated conditional estimation-optimization (ICEO) framework that estimates the underlying conditional distribution of the random parameter while considering the structure of the optimization problem. We directly model the relationship between the conditional distribution of the random parameter and the contextual features and then estimate the probabilistic model with an objective that aligns with the downstream optimization problem. We show that our ICEO approach is asymptotically consistent under moderate regularity conditions and further provide finite performance guarantees. Computationally, performing estimation with the ICEO approach is a nonconvex and often nondifferentiable optimization problem. We propose a general methodology for approximating the potentially nondifferentiable mapping from estimated conditional distribution to the optimal decision by a differentiable function, which greatly improves the performance of gradient-based algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate the empirical success of our approach in different situations, including with limited data samples and model mismatches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the impact of lawsuit advertisements targeting drug companies. Although the main purpose of the ads is to recruit potential lawsuit plaintiffs, they also reach a broad audience of viewers. Medical professionals have raised concerns that drug injury ads may lead uninjured patients to misperceive the risks and benefits of treatment, leading them to discontinue medically necessary drugs. The paper examines how drug injury ads affect prescription fills and subsequent health outcomes. The empirical context analyzes anticoagulants, which are commonly used by elderly patients to prevent strokes. The study finds that drug injury ads lead to a decrease in filled prescriptions for targeted drugs and a corresponding increase in hospitalizations for conditions treated with anticoagulants. These results point to meaningful public health consequences and highlight the benefits from policy responses that promote accurate and balanced information.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: Financial support for this research was generously provided through the National Science Foundation [Grant SES-1919040] and the Morrison Center for Marketing and Data Analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04294 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health sensing for chronic disease management creates immense benefits for social welfare. Existing health sensing studies primarily focus on the prediction of physical chronic diseases. Depression, a widespread complication of chronic diseases is, however, understudied. We draw on the medical literature to support depression detection using motion sensor data. To connect humans in this decision making, safeguard trust, and ensure algorithm transparency, we develop an interpretable deep learning model: temporal prototype network (TempPNet). TempPNet is built on the emergent prototype learning models. To accommodate the temporal characteristic of sensor data and the progressive property of depression, TempPNet differs from existing prototype learning models in its capability of capturing temporal progressions of prototypes. Extensive empirical analyses using real-world motion sensor data show that TempPNet outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in depression detection. Moreover, TempPNet interprets its decision by visualizing the temporal progression of depression and its corresponding symptoms detected from sensor data. We further employ a user study and a medical expert panel to demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study offers an algorithmic solution for impactful social good—collaborative care of chronic diseases and depression in health sensing. Methodologically, it contributes to extant literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for depression detection from sensor data. Patients, doctors, and caregivers can deploy our model on mobile devices to monitor patients’ depression risks in real time. Our model’s interpretability also allows human experts to participate in the decision making by reviewing the interpretation and making informed interventions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the 2023 court-ordered Freedom of Information Act release of standardized Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) reports to examine the workforce diversity of federal contractors. Using the released data for a sample of more than 19,000 publicly traded and private firms, we provide descriptive evidence on the variation in gender and racial diversity of these companies’ workforce. We also document the existence of a racial gap between managers and lower-level employees. A substantial portion of that gap cannot be explained by industry or geographic factors, reflecting the influence of firm-level characteristics. Then, focusing on a sample of more than 800 publicly traded federal contractors, we find robust evidence that the racial managerial gap is associated with firms’ decision to withhold the voluntary disclosure of their EEO-1 forms. Although our findings are subject to several caveats, we provide important evidence on workforce diversity and highlight the importance of using granular, firm-level data to study diversity topics.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07432 .</content>

    <title>Effects of Financial Constraints on Supply Chain Financing Choices and Operational Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bank credit access allows firms to borrow funds from banks and other financial institutions. Although theories have been developed on how bank financing affects firms’ operational decisions, empirical investigations in operations management (OM) literature remain limited. This study examines firms’ inventory management strategies in response to the enhanced credit lines from the adoption of interstate bank branching laws, which introduced staggered access to bank credit for operational firms. By merging multiple datasets with credit line information from 10-K SEC filings, we constructed a panel data set covering 1990–2005. Utilizing a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we find that improved bank credit access leads to a 6% faster inventory turnover, rather than an increase in inventory investment. This outcome appears to stem from short-term increases in capacity investments leveraging their enhanced bank credit and increased use of trade credit, alongside long-term improvements in infrastructure and capital intensity. While these developments are more pronounced for small firms in concentrated markets, their advantage translates into increased competition, negatively impacting the market position and profitability of larger firms. Additionally, in a broader supply chain context, focal firms experience faster inventory turnover when their major customers access more bank credit. The effect is especially prominent for large suppliers in competitive markets, driven by increased sales volumes. This research enhances understanding of the extensive impact of bank credit on operational management and offers insights for policymakers about the diverse effects of bank regulations across different market players and sectors.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for AI integration in research, particularly for data annotation and text classification. However, researchers lack guidance on implementation best practices, as the benefits and risks of these tools remain poorly understood. We develop a foundational framework for effective LLM implementation in management research, providing structured guidance on key decisions throughout the research process. We illustrate this framework through an empirical application: classifying sustainability claims in crowdfunding projects. While LLMs can match or exceed traditional methods' performance at lower cost, we find that variations in prompt design can significantly affect results and downstream analyses. We develop procedures for sensitivity analysis and provide detailed documentation to help researchers implement robustness while maintaining methodological integrity.Managerial SummaryLarge language models (LLMs) offer powerful new tools for business research, especially for analyzing and categorizing text data. However, managers and researchers lack clear guidance on how to use these tools effectively and reliably. This study creates a practical framework for implementing LLMs in management research, covering key decisions from model selection to result validation. Using a real‐world example of analyzing sustainability claims in crowdfunding campaigns, we demonstrate that LLMs can match traditional methods while being faster and cheaper. However, small changes in how you instruct the AI can significantly alter results and business conclusions. We provide systematic procedures for testing result reliability and offer practical tools to help managers implement AI‐powered analysis while maintaining rigorous standards and avoiding misleading findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer choices are constrained in many markets due to either supply-side rationing or information frictions. Examples include matching markets for schools and colleges; entry-level labor markets; limited brand awareness and inattention in consumer markets; and selective admissions to healthcare services. We analyze a general random utility model for consumer preferences that allows for endogenous characteristics and a reduced-form choice-set formation rule that can be derived from models of the examples described above. We show non-parametric identification of this model, propose an estimator, and apply these methods to study admissions in the market for kidney dialysis in California. Our identification results require two sets of instruments, one that only affects consumer preferences and the other that only affects choice sets. We show that both instruments are necessary for identification. These results also suggest tests of choice-set constraints, which we apply to the dialysis market. We find that dialysis facilities are less likely to admit new patients when they have a higher-than-normal caseload and that patients are more likely to travel further when nearby facilities have high caseloads. Finally, we estimate consumers’ preferences and facilities’ rationing rules using a Gibbs sampler.</content>

    <title>When a Star Shines Too Bright: The Impact of a High-Status Minority Member on Pursuing Diversity Goals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The current research examines a potential implication of having a high-status minority member in organizations—a “star” athlete, professor, or lawyer. Building on the literature on organizational diversity, individual status, and licensing effects, we suggest that having a minority member with high status can license organizational decision makers to reduce their effort in increasing diversity compared with having a minority member with relatively low status. We analyzed the hiring outcomes of Major League Baseball teams from 1988 to 2019 and found that the teams with a higher-status minority player hired fewer minority players in the next draft compared with the teams with a lower-status minority player. This effect was moderated by role prototypicality and group membership—the attributes that would further increase the saliency of a high-status minority player. We then corroborated these findings in a laboratory experiment showing that participants were less willing to invest effort in hiring minority candidates when a company already had a high-status (versus low-status) minority member. These findings extend existing literature by demonstrating when and how the presence of a prominent minority member might inadvertently diminish organizational efforts to increase diversity.Funding: The studies were funded by New York University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15155 .</content>

    <title>Race, Sexual Orientation, and Intersectionality in Distributive Negotiation Outcomes for Men</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Negotiations have consequences for people’s career trajectories, wealth, and well-being. Yet we still have a limited understanding of how demographic characteristics such as sexual orientation and race influence distributive negotiation outcomes, much less the intersection of multiple marginalized identities. To contribute to (1) our understanding of how identity influences negotiations and (2) research on intersectionality, we test how race (Black versus East Asian versus White) and sexual orientation (gay versus straight) influence distributive negotiation outcomes for men in a field experiment. We conducted a large-scale (n = 3,000), preregistered audit experiment involving (fictitious) buyers negotiating for cars on Craigslist. Sellers were 7.7 percentage points (22.4%) less likely to respond to gay versus straight White men. Sellers were also less polite in responses to Black and East Asian men (of any sexual orientation) than to straight White men. In a preregistered follow-up experiment (n = 500), we show that impoliteness in negotiation responses reduces positive expectations about negotiations and behavioral intentions to negotiate in the future, suggesting that differences in politeness may have consequences for racial minorities’ willingness to initiate future negotiations. Our work illuminates how identity-based biases manifest in negotiations, offers insights into theories of intersectionality, and underscores how demand-side biases can lead to supply-side differences in negotiation propensity.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18464 .</content>

    <title>A Low-Rank Augmented Lagrangian Method for Doubly Nonnegative Relaxations of Mixed-Binary Quadratic Programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low-Rank Approaches to Large-Scale DNN OptimizationDoubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxations are a powerful tool for approximating large-scale mixed-binary quadratic programs, but their size—often involving millions of constraints—makes them difficult to solve. We propose RiNNAL, a Riemannian augmented Lagrangian method that exploits the low-rank structure often present in optimal solutions. By applying a low-rank decomposition, RiNNAL reformulates most quadratic constraints into simpler affine ones, reducing problem complexity and mitigating issues caused by violations of Slater’s condition. A key innovation is showing that the required metric projection onto a certain algebraic variety, although nonconvex in form, can be solved as a convex optimization problem under mild regularity conditions, enforced through constraint reformulation. RiNNAL is versatile, handling not only DNN relaxations but also general semidefinite programs with polyhedral constraints. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks confirm its efficiency and robustness, making RiNNAL a promising solver for large-scale optimization problems.</content>

    <title>Local Cost Synergies in Reverse Auctions: An Application to Road Salt Procurement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Each winter, Minnesota’s Department of Transportation purchases nearly a quarter-million tons of road salt through competitive auctions. In Local Cost Synergies in Reverse Auctions: An Application to Road Salt Procurement (Gupta, Schmitt, and Stamatopoulos), the authors show that large firms benefit from “local cost synergies” when they win clusters of nearby depots. Because these synergies reduce costs, large firms are able to bid about 9% lower, on average, than they would otherwise. This cost advantage sharply reduces the probability that small firms will win contracts and leads simultaneous auctions to allocate depots less efficiently than possible. The authors conclude that any rigorous examination of procurement auctions must explicitly account for local cost synergies; ignoring them risks producing misleading results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of information processing and learning about expected future cashflows on the level and timing of risk premiums in the cross section of firms. Learning with information sources of different qualities endogenously generates value firms, growth firms, and a value premium in equilibrium. Furthermore, the learning model predicts an upward-sloping equity term structure for value firms and a flat equity term structure for growth firms. Using earnings, return, and news data on value and growth firms, we show that the predictions of the learning model are consistent with the data.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: Research support from Long-Term Investors@UniTo, the University of Neuchatel, and the University of Toronto is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05922 .</content>

    <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Strategies with Predictive and Prognostic Covariates in Adaptive Clinical Trials</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Biomedical research may uncover insights regarding the interaction of the treatments of a disease with patient covariates. We show how to use such insights to improve the efficiency of adaptive clinical trials for precision medicine by extending ideas from optimal Bayesian learning. We present a model for response-adaptive multi-arm clinical trials that leverages knowledge about the predictive-prognostic covariate structure to accelerate the learning of personalized treatment strategies that obtain the best expected outcomes for post-trial patients. Our base model is a contextual linear bandit for best-arm identification, and outcomes may be observed with delay. We characterize the optimal policy for sequentially allocating treatments to in-trial patients and, because it is hard to compute, propose several computable heuristics based on Bayesian one-step look-ahead techniques. We prove that several of our proposed heuristics are asymptotically optimal in learning treatment strategies. Numerical results based on two case studies motivated by sepsis management show that our heuristics can significantly improve clinical trial efficiency to learn a treatment strategy for precision medicine. We provide extensions that allow for rewards from outcomes of in-trial patients (resolving the exploration-exploitation tradeoff) and for inferring covariate structure using Lasso when biomedical insights on covariate structure are lacking. Our proposed trial design is of interest to funders, designers, and managers of clinical trials. It may also apply to other contextual bandit problems in settings where insights about covariate-treatment interactions are available.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [Grant 676129].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we develop novel measures of managerial labor market classification and competition by constructing networks of compensation benchmarking peers disclosed in proxy statements. These networks represent firms’ relative positions within the managerial labor market. Our classifications strongly predict executive moves across firms, outperforming a comprehensive set of predictors in the literature. Subsequent tests further demonstrate the strength of our methodology in capturing the multidimensional and dynamic features of the managerial labor market. We also validate our competition measures by showing that they are associated with retention tools, such as higher equity pay and longer pay duration. Finally, we apply our measures to test two theoretical predictions. First, we find that labor market competition could explain controversial pay practices. Second, we demonstrate that the labor market provides managers with tournament incentives to deliver superior future performance.</content>

    <title>Founders' pre‐entry knowledge and the heterogeneous returns to accelerator participation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While startup accelerators often benefit founders and their ventures, these gains may not be uniform. We examine how founders' pre‐entry knowledge—the cumulative education, industry experience, and entrepreneurial exposure that teams acquire prior to launching their startups—shapes the heterogeneous returns to accelerator participation. We propose two potential mechanisms driving these returns:knowledge compensation, whereby accelerators fill gaps in basic knowledge and competencies, andknowledge complementarity, whereby accelerators amplify the absorption and deployment of expert knowledge. Using data from 6723 startups and their founding teams, we find evidence in support of the complementarity mechanism. Our findings also suggest that the returns to accelerator participation are contingent on the alignment between founders' pre‐entry knowledge and program design.Managerial SummaryWhile startup accelerators aim to level the entrepreneurial playing field, we find that founders with substantial pre‐entry knowledge and experience tend to gain more from participation in these programs than novice entrepreneurs, potentially widening startup performance gaps. Program design also appears to play a key role. While specialized and unstructured programs offer value for seasoned entrepreneurs by building complementary knowledge, structured and generalist programs offer some, albeit limited, opportunities for less‐experienced teams to build foundational skills. These findings underscore the need for tailored programming that aligns with participants' learning needs. For program designers and policymakers, these findings suggest investing in diverse formats to support varied founder profiles. For entrepreneurs, they highlight the importance of selecting programs that complement and build upon their team's prior knowledge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the U.S. housing credit boom, publicly traded banks increased mortgage lending activity and relaxed standards much more than privately held banks. The increase in risk had real effects for a variety of county-level aggregates including employment and consumption. Cross-sectional evidence and a quasi-experiment indicate that the increase in risk stemmed from the institutional ownership and the equity compensation of publicly traded banks, in turn leading banks to place greater weight on short-term equity performance. These results are consistent with the view that a focus on short-term earnings and stock prices amplifies boom–bust credit cycles, in turn leading to real cycles for the aggregate economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use novel surveys of firms and workers, linked to administrative employer-employee data, to study the prevalence and importance of individual bargaining in wage determination. We show that simple survey questions accurately elicit firms’ bargaining strategies. Using the elicited strategies for 772 German firms, we document that the majority of firms are willing to engage in individual wage bargaining. Labor market factors predict firms’ strategies better than firm characteristics. Survey responses from nearly 10,000 full-time workers indicate that most workers provide their salary expectations before they receive a job offer. Most outside offers are rejected, with the worker remaining at the incumbent firm. There is substantial heterogeneity in workers’ bargaining behavior, which translates into within-firm wage inequality. Firms that set pay via individual bargaining have a 3 percentage point higher gender wage gap.</content>

    <title>Diversifying Society’s Leaders? The Determinants and Causal Effects of Admission to Highly Selective Private Colleges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use anonymized admissions data from several colleges linked to income tax records and SAT and ACT test scores to study the determinants and causal effects of attending Ivy-Plus colleges (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and Chicago). Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at Ivy-Plus colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, and (3) athletic recruitment. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average flagship public college increases students- chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 50%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and almost triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. The three factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas academic credentials such as SAT/ACT scores are highly predictive of post-college success.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the role of strategic timing in disruptive innovation. We construct a model where an entrant decides when to enter with a potentially disruptive technology and the incumbent determines whether and when to switch from its existing technology. By accounting for endogenous firm-specific learning alongside exogenous technological improvement, our model highlights the critical role of timing in shaping disruption. First, an entrant’s strategic timing—whether to enter early or delay entry—can cause disruption by deferring the timing of the incumbent’s response or deterring it altogether. Second, we identify conditions where incumbents, even those unable to initially mount a response, can later switch to the disruptive technology and coexist with an entrant. Based on these insights, we propose a typology of five distinct disruption types—Perfect, Postponed, Passing, Phased, and Partial—that expands the traditional understanding of disruption beyond the often-studied “perfect” cases to comprehend transient and mixed cases as well. Our theory of disruptive timing integrates literature on strategic timing and disruptive innovation to offer a new perspective for scholars and actionable insights for practitioners.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01734 .</content>

    <title>How Does Health Insurance Affect Firm Employment and Performance? Evidence from Obamacare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article discusses how mandating employers to provide health insurance of a minimum quality and the associated increases in health insurance premia affect firm employment and performance. Using firm-level employee health insurance data around the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we show that the PPACA is associated with a significant increase in health insurance premia for employees in company-sponsored health insurance plans. In response, employers with greater exposure to the PPACA reduce employee enrollments in their health insurance plans to a larger extent after the law’s enactment. Our analysis suggests that employers achieve this reduction in enrollment by shifting employment composition from full-time employees to part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, who are not covered in employer-sponsored health insurance plans. Furthermore, we find no evidence of deterioration in performance at companies more exposed to the increase in health insurance premia. Overall, our findings illustrate how firms adapt to and mitigate cost increases associated with regulatory changes through strategic labor practices.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03761 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can we compare approaches to increase retirement savings? Messaging interventions, active choice frameworks, and automatic enrollment all increase retirement savings, but evidence supporting these approaches spans widely different institutional settings, populations, and time periods. In this study, we use experimental and quasi-experimental variation in these approaches within a constant setting using interventions in the U.S. military during 2016–2018. We find large differences in the efficacy of these approaches, with active choice and automatic enrollment programs being about 10 and 100 times more effective than messaging interventions, respectively. We also collect novel data on program costs and generate estimates of cost-effectiveness for each program. We find that active choice and automatic enrollment are consistently more cost effective than any messaging interventions, active choice programs are the most cost-effective for small firms, and automatic enrollment is the most cost-effective program for larger firms.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the TIAA Institute, Wharton School’s Pension Research Council and Boettner Center, the Social Security Administration, and the NBER Retirement and Disability Research Center for financial support.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compassion ventures addressing human suffering after disasters are gaining attention in entrepreneurship research, yet little is known about their potential to expand beyond immediate response. This 19-month qualitative study examines a compassion venture amid the Russo-Ukrainian war and shows how self-reliant, joint, and political forms of entrepreneurial resourcefulness help compassion ventures emerge, formalize, and expand with key partners. We uncover how these forms interact, helping compassion ventures transition to enduring organizations over a prolonged crisis. We present a model of resourcefulness dynamics in compassion venture expansion, emphasizing its political dimension, and contribute to research on compassion venturing and entrepreneurial resourcefulness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although scholars across several disciplines have noted the “posttruth” turn in public discourse, institutionalists provide little insight into the use of lying as a form of strategic discourse in contesting institutionalized practices, values, and beliefs. We address this gap by developing theory about the role that lies play in the discursive contestation of issue fields. We posit the concept of strategic lies (i.e., lies intended to manipulate the institutionalized practices, values, and beliefs at the focus of an issue field) and explicate how such lies cause epistemic conflicts (i.e., discursive conflicts between the field’s discrete communities over the truth value of those lies). We suggest that these epistemic conflicts increase a field’s level of polarization and concomitantly destabilize the field’s institutional status quo. We highlight the integral role that media organizations play in epistemic conflicts by explaining how such organizations frame statements as strategic lies and publicize them to the communities comprising an issue field. We assert that strategic lies can catalyze vicious cycles of polarization and epistemic conflict in issue fields. Our study thus provides a novel and rigorous conceptualization of the important role of strategic lying in the institutional processes structuring a field.</content>

    <title>Consider or Choose? The Role and Power of Consideration Sets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consideration sets play a crucial role in discrete choice modeling, where customers often form consideration sets in the first stage and then use a second-stage choice mechanism to select the product with the highest utility. Although many recent studies aim to improve choice models by incorporating more sophisticated second-stage choice mechanisms, this paper takes a step back and goes into the opposite extreme. We simplify the second-stage choice mechanism to its most basic form and focus on modeling customer choice by emphasizing the role and power of the first-stage consideration set formation. To this end, we study a model that is parameterized solely by a distribution over consideration sets with a bounded rationality interpretation. Intriguingly, we show that this model is characterized by the axiom of symmetric demand cannibalization, enabling complete statistical identification. The latter finding highlights the critical role of consideration sets in the identifiability of two-stage choice models. We also examine the model’s implications for assortment planning, proving that the optimal assortment is revenue-ordered within each partition block created by consideration sets. Despite this compelling structure, we establish that the assortment problem under this model is NP-hard even to approximate, highlighting how consideration sets contribute to nontractability, even under the simplest uniform second-stage choice mechanism. Finally, using real-world data, we show that the model achieves prediction performance comparable to other advanced choice models. Given the simplicity of the model’s second-stage phase, this result showcases the enormous power of first-stage consideration set formation in capturing customers’ decision-making processes.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00442 .</content>

    <title>Beyond Discrete‐Time Hazard Regression: Bayesian Regularization for Dynamic Churn Modeling</title>
    <updated>2025-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discrete‐time hazard regression is widely applied to firm‐level time‐to‐event analyses and increasingly to individual churn behaviors. While the discrete logit hazard model for panel data remains the workhorse in OM, both fixed‐effects and random‐effects specifications have key limitations. The Grassia(II)‐Geometric (G2G) model—allowing for dynamic churn and asymmetric heterogeneity—offers a compelling alternative for hazard regression and churn prediction. To address high‐dimensional data, we propose Bayesian sparsity modeling via spike‐and‐slab LASSO (SSL) that enables simultaneous regularization and inference—both crucial for explanatory hypothesis testing. Simulation studies show that even when data are generated from logit functions with additive heterogeneity, asymmetric heterogeneity undermines logit regression, whereas G2G‐SSL achieves stronger out‐of‐sample fit with lower false discovery rates. We further validate its predictive power in an empirical study on voluntary employee turnover at a Fortune 500 manufacturer. The proposed approach outperforms a range of advanced methods, improving both churn time prediction and cost efficiency for prescriptive workforce planning. Finally, we outline methodological extensions and provide a modeling procedure for discrete hazard regression analysis. By importing insights from marketing and Bayesian statistics, our work enables OM scholars to move beyond traditional hazard models and better capture real‐world heterogeneity across a broad range of contractual churn scenarios.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Asset Selling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online asset-selling businesses, such as used cars and real estate platforms, have experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Unlike general retail operations, which make decisions at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level, asset selling operates at the individual unit asset level. Practical operational constraints (e.g., infrequent price adjustments within a limited timeframe) set asset-selling platforms apart from general retail. Further complicating decision-making are real-world uncertainties, such as volatile demand and unknown latent value of the asset. We present a dynamic pricing framework that captures the salient characteristics of the asset-selling business while leveraging consumer online behavioral data to maximize the payoff of individual assets. We develop practical algorithms for solving the dynamic pricing problem, including a mean approximation (MA) algorithm that uses forecast mean values as proxies for future customer arrival rates and online learning algorithms that integrate learning of the latent value of an asset with dynamic pricing decisions. To evaluate these algorithms, we propose an asymptotic regime suitable for the online asset-selling business context, one that scales up customer demand arrival rate within a finite time horizon. The key findings are that, under mild conditions, the expected value of selling an asset is concave and increasing at a logarithmic rate with respect to demand rates and increasing no faster than a linear speed in the asset’s latent value. These properties allow us to derive the performance bounds of our policies. An extensive numerical study and a real-data calibrated case study demonstrate the practical value of our proposed algorithms, suggesting that those simple heuristics can achieve strong performance in the asset-selling environment. Moreover, our integration of the learning of an asset’s latent value with dynamic pricing decisions, alongside asymptotic analysis, provides a robust framework for data-driven decision-making and demonstrates the potential of consumer behavior data as a strategic asset for online asset-selling platforms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Driving Music Demand in the Age of Streaming: Understanding the Heterogeneity in Curated Playlist Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The shift from physical music consumption to online music streaming has fundamentally transformed the market for recorded music, giving consumers access to millions of songs on demand. Because streaming platforms pay artists and labels on a per-play basis, sustained listening and effective discovery have become essential for generating meaningful revenue. With traditional marketing losing relevance for recorded music, curated collections in the form of playlists have emerged as a potentially vital tool for labels to lift streaming demand. As a result, labels have started to deploy playlist marketing by either curating their own playlists or by targeting influential playlists curated by others. However, the success factors behind the impact of playlists on song demand remain insufficiently understood. An analysis of 200,455 quasi-experiments where songs are listed on playlists and later delisted shows an average listing effect of 8.5% more global streams and a carry-over effect of 4% after delisting. Although these effects are highly heterogeneous, they can be systematically explained by playlist design characteristics, including playlist popularity, the song’s prior playlist exposure, the fit between the song and playlist, curator identity, and the curation approach. These findings empower labels to deploy more informed playlist marketing to lift streaming revenue.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Design thinking (DT) has generated significant attention in relation to new product development and innovation and, more generally, value creation activities. Despite its focus on identifying and addressing the needs of users and other stakeholders in an empathetic way, several implementations of DT have resulted in ethically questionable products with negative consequences for firms, customers, and society. This research adopts a grounded theory approach to understand the main ethical concerns with DT as currently practiced and to investigate how DT teams could better include ethical considerations in their work. Based on the analysis of data gathered from in-depth interviews with DT practitioners, it identifies four ethics-related blind spots caused by: (1) the exclusion of the natural environment, (2) narrow definitions of users, (3) quick prototyping and testing, and (4) the rapid increase of scale. Using the development of a Responsible AI product as an illustration, we show that firms can develop three interrelated capabilities to mitigate these blind spots: (1) systemic inclusion of impacted entities and stakeholders, (2) anticipation and mitigation of potential harms, and (3) ethical governance. Together, they form a novel approach: Responsible Design Thinking. The article concludes by discussing our contributions to theory and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effect of nonlinear pricing on markups and misallocation. In a general equilibrium model in which firms are allowed to set a quantity-dependent pricing schedule, markup heterogeneity is not a sign of misallocation. Instead, we point to a new source of misallocation: high-taste consumers are allocated too much of each good, low-taste consumers too little. Using micro data from the retail sector, we show that nonlinear pricing is prevalent and quantify the model. Welfare losses from misallocation across consumers are substantially larger than those from misallocation across firms under linear pricing. (JEL D21, D24, D43, H25, J22, L13, L81)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper demonstrates that labor market regulations, such as minimum wages or payroll taxes, shape trade competition in labor-intensive activities. I exploit data from a large European trade program where firms from different countries supply labor services at the same location but face different payroll taxes and minimum wage rules. Country case studies and model-consistent gravity estimates show large trade responses to tax and regulatory reforms, with an elasticity of trade in services to labor costs larger than one. The results imply that absent regulatory and fiscal harmonization, export competitiveness depends, in part, on domestic labor market policies. (JEL F14, F16, F42, H25, J22, J23, K31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of quid pro quo (technology for market access) in facilitating knowledge spillovers and quality upgrading in the Chinese automobile industry. The identification strategy exploits within-product quality variation across a rich set of quality dimensions. We find affiliated domestic automakers adopt more similar quality strengths of their joint venture partners, consistent with knowledge spillovers. Additional analysis suggests worker flows and supplier networks mediate knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers due to ownership affiliation under quid pro quo contributed 8.3 percent of the quality improvement experienced by affiliated domestic models from 2001 to 2014, relative to nonaffiliated domestic models.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Identifying the optimal set of individuals to first receive information (“seeds”) in a social network to maximize expected diffusion is a widely studied question in many settings. Several studies propose network-centrality-based heuristics to select seeds likely to increase diffusion. Here, we show that, for the classic independent cascade model of diffusion, either seeding a few more individuals at random can prompt a larger diffusion than optimal seeding or optimal seeding itself results in limited spread. These findings hold across a broad range of random networks and are supported by simulations on real-world networks. (JEL D83, D85, O12, O18, P25, P32, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the strong negative effect of higher mortgage rates on cash-out refinancing reflects substitution into other borrowing products, not large changes in total new household borrowing. We exploit plausibly exogenous changes in interest rates due to unconventional monetary policy surprises to show that changes in cash-out and other borrowing are roughly offsetting. The elasticity of new household borrowing with respect to mortgage rates is low and varies little with the borrower’s outstanding mortgage rate. Our results suggest that the cash-out refinance channel of unconventional monetary policy is weak and not path dependent. (JEL E43, E52, G21, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 100 US retirement plans and a representative UK panel, I document the impact of auto-enrollment (AE) on retirement savings at different horizons. I replicate the impact of AE on participation and contributions in the short run (at 12 months), but I show that these gains are attenuated over the medium run (at 36 months). At this longer horizon, the average savings increases are modest, though AE significantly lowers inequality in savings. To assess AE’s lifetime impact, I estimate a life cycle consumption-savings model that can fit the observed patterns with a switching cost of approximately $250, smaller than previous estimates.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A college degree offers a pathway to economic mobility for low-income students. Using a multisite randomized controlled trial combined with administrative and survey data, we demonstrate that intensive advising during high school and college significantly increases bachelor’s degree attainment among lower-income students. We leverage unique data on preadvising college preferences and causal forest methods to show that these gains are primarily driven by improvements in initial enrollment quality. Our results suggest that strategies targeting college choice may be a more effective and efficient means of increasing degree attainment than those focused solely on affordability.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study neighborhood choice using a novel research design that contrasts the move rate of homeowners who receive a new different-race neighbor immediately next-door versus slightly farther away on the same block. This approach isolates a component of preferences directly attributable to neighbors’ identities. Both Black and White homeowners are more likely to move after receiving a new different-race neighbor. Findings are robust to additional controls (e.g., income) and alternative research designs. We find evidence of heterogeneity in responses, especially associated with housing density, which has implications for understanding contemporary neighborhood racial change and prospects for maintaining stable, integrated neighborhoods.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a two-country model in which currency and bond markets are populated by different investor clienteles, and segmentation is partly overcome by arbitrageurs with limited capital. Risk premia in our model are time-varying, connected across markets, and consistent with the empirical violations of uncovered interest parity and expectations hypothesis. Through risk premia, large-scale bond purchases lower domestic and foreign bond yields and depreciate the currency, and short-rate cuts lower foreign yields, with smaller effects than bond purchases. Currency returns are disconnected from long-maturity bond returns, and yet the currency market is instrumental in transmitting bond demand shocks across countries.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a bottom-up approach to estimate the slope of the primitive form of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, which features marginal cost as the real activity variable. Using quarterly micro data on prices, costs, and output, we estimate dynamic pass-through regressions that identify the slope as a function of primitive parameters. We find a high slope for the cost-based Phillips curve, which contrasts with the low estimates of the conventional output gap–based formulation found in the literature. We reconcile by showing that the output elasticity of marginal cost is low, at least during moderate inflation periods (e.g., pre-pandemic). (JEL C51, E12, E23, E31, E32, L60)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether the quality of managers can affect public service provision in the context of public health. Using novel data from public hospitals in Chile, we show how the introduction of a competitive recruitment system and better pay for public hospital CEOs reduced hospital mortality by 8 percent. The effect is not explained by a change in patient composition. We find that the policy changed the pool of CEOs by displacing doctors with no management training in favor of CEOs who had studied management. Productivity improvements were driven by hospitals that recruited higher quality CEOs. (JEL D24, G34, I11, I18, J45, M54, O15)</content>
