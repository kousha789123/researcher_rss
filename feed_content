    <title>EXPRESS: Giving Thanks: How Managers Should Respond to Compliments in Positive Word-of-Mouth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers expect managers to respond to positive reviews, but it is unclear whether these responses are beneficial. This research finds that managerial responses to positive reviews can positively impact consumers when managers follow conversational norms for responding to compliments. It proposes that managers downplay the compliments that their firms receive via positive reviews (e.g., “Dinner was fantastic!”) and examines two norms-based strategies for doing so: 1) shift the content of the compliment (e.g., “We’re glad dinner was good.”) and 2) shift the recipient of the compliment (e.g., “…our suppliers helped.”). First, an experiment and Google Local data show a disconnect between how consumers think managers should respond and how managers currently respond. Second, six experiments test the proposed response strategies. Compared to managers that do not respond to positive reviews and to managers that write responses currently recommended by industry or academics, managers that downplay compliments improve readers’ evaluations of the firm and engagement on the platform. Downplaying the compliment improves consumer outcomes by conveying the manager’s humility, which is normative. Downplaying is most effective when the manager reduces credit to the firm, appreciates someone else involved (e.g., supplier or reviewer), and uses moderately positive descriptors (e.g., fantastic to good).</content>

    <title>The Crash Risk in Individual Stocks Embedded in Skewness Swap Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates crash risk premiums in individual stocks using skewness swaps. These swaps involve buying a stock’s risk-neutral skewness and receiving the realized skewness as a payoff. The strategy’s returns, which measure the skewness risk premium, are found to be consistently large and positive. This suggests investors are concerned about potential crashes in individual stocks and require substantial compensation for bearing this risk. Notably, significant results are mainly observed after the 2007/2009 financial crisis, indicating changes in post-crisis option market dynamics. Cross-sectional determinants of skewness swap returns include measures of systematic crash risk and stock overvaluation.</content>

    <title>Human Capital Disclosure and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Regulation S‐K</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the labor market consequences of the 2020 Regulation S‐K requiring human capital disclosure in 10K filings. Using large‐sample job‐level data and a Generative Large Language Model (GLLM), we observe that public firms subject to the regulation increase their disclosure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) information in job postings relative to a matched sample of large private firms. The increase in job‐posting disclosure is more pronounced among firms facing greater external pressure to increase their workforce diversity. These findings suggest a shift in demand for diverse candidates by public firms following the regulation. Yet, consistent with short‐term inelastic labor supply, this demand shift lengthens the recruitment period, with noticeable increases in workplace gender diversity emerging one year after the regulation, particularly among firms that demonstrate a credible commitment to DEI. Our study documents how securities regulations can impact labor market practices and underscores the challenges involved in shaping workforce diversity.</content>

    <title>Workflow Automation in Open-Source Software Development: Accelerating Innovation Through Mechanization and Orchestration</title>
    <updated>2026-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study develops a conceptual framework distinguishing two mechanisms of workflow automation: mechanization and orchestration. Mechanization automates discrete, self-contained, repeatable tasks through standardized execution to enhance consistency, reliability, and efficiency, while orchestration automates the communication between tasks, workers, and stages, which facilitates information flow and coordination. We theorize that these mechanisms differentially affect incremental versus substantive innovation. Using a multimethod approach integrating machine learning and econometrics, we analyze the effects of workflow automation in open-source software development, demonstrating that mechanization accelerates maintenance-oriented exploitative innovation, whereas orchestration accelerates development-oriented explorative innovation. This mechanization-orchestration distinction extends beyond software contexts. For practitioners, aligning automation strategies with innovation goals is essential: deploy mechanization to enhance operational efficiency and support incremental improvements in stable environments; and implement orchestration to enable adaptive coordination in exploratory, high-velocity development requiring creativity and flexibility. For policymakers, understanding this distinction informs workforce development and technology adoption policies, as automation reshapes work by shifting human contribution from routine execution toward coordinated problem solving and strategic decision making.</content>

    <title>Beyond feasibility filters: How expertise heterogeneity enables innovation recognition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations often struggle to identify promising innovations that balance novelty and feasibility in multidisciplinary domains, yet how does evaluator expertise heterogeneity shape these assessments? This study examines how evaluator expertise influences innovation evaluation through a field experiment with National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Astrobee Robotic Arm Challenge, involving 354 evaluators assessing 101 solutions. Domain‐spanning evaluators assign higher novelty ratings while maintaining similar feasibility ratings compared to domain‐specific evaluators. Domain‐adjacent evaluators show higher ratings on both dimensions. Human‐LLM analysis of 3007 evaluator comments reveals a two‐stage process: feasibility filtering (evaluating minimum viability) followed by integrative assessment (evaluating enhancement potential). Different expertise types serve complementary functions: domain‐spanning evaluators recognize enhancement potential while maintaining rigorous standards; domain‐adjacent evaluators show openness to novel approaches; domain‐specific evaluators ensure technical rigor. These findings suggest effective innovation evaluation depends on strategically combining complementary expertise types rather than identifying optimal individual evaluators.Managerial SummaryOrganizations often struggle to identify innovations that are both novel and feasible, risking missed breakthroughs or wasted resources. We study how evaluator expertise shapes innovation assessments in a field experiment with NASA, in which 354 evaluators reviewed 101 robotic arm designs. Evaluators with expertise spanning multiple domains recognize more novel yet feasible ideas. Those with single‐domain expertise provide essential technical gatekeeping but overlook cross‐domain improvements, while adjacent‐field experts are more open but less rigorous. Organizations can strengthen innovation selection by strategically combining these complementary expertise types—using domain‐specific experts for initial feasibility screening and domain‐spanning experts to identify integrative opportunities—rather than seeking one “ideal” evaluator.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study aggregate capital dynamics in an investment model with idiosyncratic productivity shocks, fixed capital adjustment costs, and irreversibility driven by a wedge between capital purchase and resale prices. We derive sufficient statistics that capture the role of investment frictions in aggregate capital fluctuations, measure these statistics using investment microdata, and exploit them to discipline the capital price wedge. Irreversibility doubles the persistence of capital fluctuations and is crucial for reconciling micro-level investment behaviour with macroeconomic propagation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and trust in government using variation in GDP growth experienced over a lifetime since birth. We assemble a newly harmonized global dataset across eleven major opinion surveys, comprising 3.3 million respondents in 166 countries since 1990. Exploiting cohort-level variation, we find that individuals who experience higher GDP growth are more prone to trust their governments, with larger effects found in democracies. Higher growth experiences are also associated with improved perceptions of government performance and living standards. We find no similar channel between growth experience and interpersonal trust. Second, more recent growth experiences appear to matter most for trust in government, with no detectable effect of growth experienced during one’s formative years, closer to birth or before birth. Third, we find evidence of a “trust paradox” whereby average trust in government is lower in democracies than in autocracies. Our results are robust to a range of falsification exercises, robustness checks and single-country evidence using the American National Election Studies and the Swiss Household Panel.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impact of Server Capability on Pooling Configuration in Stochastic Service Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Resource pooling is often introduced in service systems to cope with the variability in customer demand. The primary motivation behind creating a more flexible system is to utilize resources efficiently—namely, assigning customers whose dedicated resources are fully occupied to available non-dedicated resources (referred to as off-service placement). In such a setup, the service system manager expects to serve more customers within a fixed timeframe. However, recent empirical evidence shows that, due to limited server capability, the service time at non-dedicated providers can be significantly longer than that at dedicated ones. In this study, we develop a two-server stochastic model to examine how server capability levels and other factors—such as overall workload and demand asymmetry—affect pooling configurations. We derive conditions that specify the optimal system flexibility configuration across these parameters. Our findings reveal that a partially flexible system can outperform a fully flexible one, particularly in asymmetric scenarios with low server capability. This advantage is also pronounced when considering a range of system costs, including server capability, cross-serving, and other related costs in stochastic service systems with and without buffers. These insights from our two-server model offer guidance on designing more efficient flexibility in complex multi-class, multi-server service systems.</content>

    <title>Do Mutual Funds Respond to Mechanical Changes in ESG Ratings?</title>
    <updated>2026-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a quasi-experimental setting, we study whether mutual fund investors respond to a purely mechanical change in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings—that is, a change independent of concurrent changes in firms’ actual ESG activities. We find that when a firm experiences a mechanical increase in ESG ratings, the probability of being selected by an ESG fund increases (extensive margin). In contrast, if the firm is already in the fund’s portfolio, its holdings do not change (intensive margin), consistent with portfolio weighting being based on market capitalization. The selection effect is observable not only among funds that follow an ESG index but also among active ESG funds, which presumably should have the resources and ability to identify and filter out the mechanical increase in ESG ratings. Among active ESG funds, the selection effect is stronger for funds with less assets under management, larger portfolios of firms, and lower expense ratios, consistent with the notion that resource constraints may impede a fund’s screening ability. Our findings imply that passive investing based on commercial ESG ratings—whether due to resource constraints or portfolio indexing—might result in portfolio allocations that do not reflect the actual ESG activities of firms.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06184 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Figure-Ground Reversal (FGR) in Brand Logos on Brand Attitude</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Figure-ground reversal (FGR) transcends visual conventions by reversing the roles of figure and ground in brand logo designs. In this research, the authors study how FGR logos affect consumers’ brand attitudes. Using traditional self-reported measures as well as biometric technology, they illuminate the unique nature of FGR’s underlying mechanism and identify moderators to shed additional light on that process. Specifically, they find that the positive effect of FGR logos on brand attitude is mediated by engagement and aesthetic appeal, and moderated by the visual identification and semantic interpretability of FGR objects. Across a multi-method investigation that includes live bidding, incentive-compatible willingness-to-pay, eye-tracking, and multiple boundary condition experiments, the authors provide empirical support for these effects and reveal the underlying mechanism. They conclude by discussing the contributions of the research to the literature on visual marketing phenomena and the implications of the findings for better visual branding in the marketplace.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Downvotes on Content Creation: Evidence from Social Media</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how receiving negative peer feedback, in the form of downvotes, affects UGC creation on Reddit. We focus on the following outcomes: (a) propensity to post (incidence), (b) where users post, and (c) the strength of opinion (intensity), measured by the extremity of users’ texts. The latter two outcomes are important given ongoing concerns about how social media platforms may contribute to echo chamber formation and polarization. We find that negative feedback increases users’ subsequent posting activity, relative to no feedback, and we do not find evidence that receiving negative feedback drives users away, alleviating concerns about echo chamber formation. In addition, negative peer feedback moderates extreme sentiments—when initial views are extreme, users temper the intensity of their subsequent posts. These effects of negative feedback are consistent with users attempting to maintain their reputation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Owning to Connecting: Understanding and Leveraging the Effect of Internet Meme Marketing</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Internet meme marketing is a digital marketing practice in which marketers leverage internet memes to promote their brand or product. Despite its growing adoption in brand communications, academic understanding of meme marketing remains in its infancy. In this research, we theoretically develop and empirically test how, why, and when meme marketing is effective. We find that meme marketing enhances digital advertising effectiveness by fostering shared psychological ownership of the marketing message and subsequently a strengthened self–brand connection. In addition, the effectiveness of meme marketing diminishes when the leveraged memes are not in their maturity (i.e., during the introduction, growth, or decline stages) or when applied to promote niche products. Six studies—including a large-scale secondary data analysis (N = 900,139 posts), a field experiment (N = 423,565 impressions), and four controlled experiments (N = 3,958 participants)—provide robust and converging evidence for these propositions. The effectiveness of meme marketing is demonstrated across both behavioral outcomes (e.g., likes, click-through rates, conversion rates) and attitudinal responses (e.g., purchase intention, likelihood to like). This research advances theoretical understanding of meme marketing and offers actionable insights for practitioners seeking to leverage internet memes in their brand digital marketing communications.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Does Amazon’s Dual Role Weaken Marketplace Competition?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amazon’s dual role, as both marketplace owner and first-party (1p) seller, gives it power over third-party (3p) sellers who sell similar items. This dual role can weaken 3p sellers’ ability to compete, possibly harming 3p sellers and consumers. We examine three aspects of marketplace competition. First, we examine price change dependencies. We find that 1p price drops after either higher Buy Box (i.e., the Add to Cart or default sales box on Amazon’s product page) prices or large 3p price increases; 3p prices decrease subsequently. Second, we analyze Buy Box seller selection since this is a critical conduit for demand. We find both high 1p and 3p prices are penalized in Buy Box selection. Low-reputation and intermittent 3p sellers cannot win Buy Box even at significantly lower prices. At equal prices, for some prices, Buy Box favors 1p over equal-priced 3p, and vice versa for others. Third, to see whether entry barriers weaken competition, we estimate a 3p seller entry model. Higher 1p prices are associated with more 3p sellers, suggesting low entry barriers. Combined, our results suggest Amazon’s dual role does not weaken competition in the marketplace. We discuss implications for marketplace participants, antitrust policy and research.</content>

    <title>How Are Skills Changing with Digital Technologies? Clarifying Boundary Conditions in Management Research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article contributes to discussions about the future of work by providing a systematic review of the broad yet fragmented management literature on how skills are changing with digital technologies (DTs). Our aim was to understand the nature of scholarly engagement with this relationship to inform a future research agenda. Our systematic review identified 225 original empirical articles that explicitly examined skills and DTs. We highlight the diverse categories of context, mechanisms, and outcomes in the form of an analytical matrix, guided by an organizational conceptualization of skill that spans positivist and social constructivist approaches. Our analysis generates four theoretical framings of how skills are changing with DTs:market shift,control shift,recombination, andimbrication. These framings are derived from two analytical dimensions of skill change: transactional versus transformational and objective versus relational. We interrogate the fit between each theoretical framing and the affordances of DTs, bringing to light how skill change with DTs is entangled with shifting temporal dimensions and a rich variety of interactions and interdependencies. Our theoretical framings, analytical dimensions, and insights into the relationship between skill change and DTs provide the basis for a more coherent management research agenda.</content>

    <title>Are Social Media Platforms a Threat to Democracy? An Ecosystem Governance Perspective</title>
    <updated>2026-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Castello, Colleoni, Scherer, and Trittin contend that social media platforms threaten democratic processes by facilitating the spread of misinformation and fostering polarized debates – dynamics that ultimately serve to monetize user attention. We acknowledge the problem but challenge their proposed solution of conceptualizing social media as political spaces. Instead, drawing on ecosystem theory, we propose an ‘ecosystem failure’ analysis as a more robust analytical framework. Within this perspective, we see these information‐related problems as negative externalities that weaken the entire platform ecosystem. These externalities are structurally distinct due to algorithmic curation that selectively amplifies content in ways that reinforce user biases, strong network effects with almost zero replication costs, and engagement‐based monetization that decouples production from editorial standards. We therefore advance a reflexive ecosystem governance approach that accounts for broader ecosystem value, shifting the focus beyond short‐term economic performance to encompass overall ecosystem health. This approach transforms the management of negative externalities into a core strategic interest for the platform and aligns the incentives of individual actors ex ante, by design, prioritizing risk‐adjusted reach and demotion of low‐integrity content over ex post moderation. We analyse the mechanisms that align private incentives with democratic resilience and highlight the inherent trade‐offs involved.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Custodians are integral to institutional maintenance, and instrumental to preserving institutionally significant places. Yet when institutional decline impacts institutionally significant places, we do not know how custodians manage the tensions between preservation efforts aimed at saving these places and the need for adaptation. Using a rich qualitative dataset of interviews with custodians from and participant observation at 26 rural church buildings in England, we examine custodian responses when institutional decline in belief in Christian religion impacts sacred church buildings. We find that in response to experiencing place materiality, relational, and practices tensions, custodians are torn between preserving the institutional role of place and the need to find resources to maintain such places. Custodians manage these tensions by deliberatively evaluating materiality alterations and adopting innovative practices within the bounds of institutional appropriateness and resource constraints. The process we flesh out leads to distinct outcomes: place augmentation, practices augmentation, and, in a few instances, no augmentation. Our model portrays the pathways followed by institutional custodians that are rooted in the tensions they experience between the attachment to the institutional role of place and the need for change in response to institutional decline. Our study contributes to research on custodianship and place by uncovering divergent custodian responses when institutional decline impacts institutionally significant places and place as an institutional carrier and the locus of custodian place work.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The opportunity actualization perspective has recently gained attention as a key framework for exploring entrepreneurial opportunity. The perspective’s theorizing, however, predominantly focuses on profit-driven opportunities, limiting its applicability across the spectrum of entrepreneurial behavior. To broaden applicability, we examine how entrepreneurs motivated by social and economic considerations form their opportunity beliefs. We use a qualitative research approach that combines think-aloud protocols and semi-structured interviews with 24 impact entrepreneurs. Our findings allow us to develop a holistic model of social business opportunity belief formation, incorporating market and non-economic considerations, emphasizing the role of non-market stakeholders. We derive important implications for both theory and practice.</content>

    <title>Post-M&amp;amp;A Retention of Top Managers: The Role of Structural Knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the role of managerial structural knowledge in postacquisition integration (PAI) and its association with the retention of target firm managers. Although retaining top managers is often linked to improved acquisition outcomes, the conditions under which their retention may support integration remain underexplored. Drawing on organizational modularity theory, we theorize that structural similarity between acquiring and target firms is associated with higher managerial retention in related acquisitions. We propose that structural knowledge, defined as managers’ experience within specific organizational structures, can support PAI and is associated with improved postacquisition performance. Using a data set of 2,941 mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals and 18,987 target firm managers (1994–2018), we find a positive relationship between structural similarity and the retention of target managers in related acquisitions. At the individual level, managers with structural knowledge aligned with the acquiring firm’s structure are more likely to be retained. Furthermore, the relationship between structural similarity and retention is stronger when the geographic distance between firms is greater or when the deal requires deep integration, as in absorption-type acquisitions. Finally, structural similarity between acquiring and target firms is positively associated with improved postacquisition performance. Our findings contribute to the M&amp;A literature by introducing a structural knowledge perspective in understanding PAI. Our study also highlights the role of organizational modularity in M&amp;As and advances the strategic human capital literature by identifying structural knowledge as a critical component of managerial capabilities.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18686 .</content>

    <title>Spatial Distribution of Access to Service: Theory and Evidence from Ride-Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study access to ride-sharing across geographical regions using both theoretical and empirical analyses. We specifically model and examine the effects of economies of density in ride-sharing. Our model predicts that (i) economies of density skew access to ride-sharing away from less dense regions; (ii) the skew will be more pronounced for smaller platforms (i.e., “thinner markets”); and (iii) ride-sharing platforms do not find this skew efficient and thus, use price and wage levers to mitigate (but not eliminate) it. We show that these insights are robust to whether the source of economies of density is the supply side or the demand side. We then calibrate our model using ride-level Uber data from New York City. We use the model to simulate counterfactual scenarios, offering a quantitative evaluation of our theoretical results and informing platform strategy and policy.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02699 .</content>

    <title>Chasing Market Growth and Matching Performance in Two-Sided Platforms: Evidence from the Lazy-Minting Policy in an NFT Marketplace</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common challenge faced by two-sided marketplaces is to expand the market while ensuring satisfactory matching of the two sides. We study a new platform growth strategy that increases market thickness with free entry while allowing suppliers to discretionarily signal product quality to buyers, thus forming a tiered market structure that maintains matching performance. We consider such an example with nonfungible token (NFT) markets where suppliers could choose to delay the entry cost of the NFT creation fee until an NFT is sold (lazy minting) or pay the fee up front at the time of NFT creation (gas minting). We use the difference-in-differences strategy to identify the impact of this lazy-minting policy on market matching performance. We find that the impacts of this policy are multifaceted: Although the introduction of lazy minting reduces the average matching likelihood of an NFT by 98.2%, it increases the gas-minting segment’s matching likelihood by 112.3% and first-sale price by 126.5%. Overall, this new growth strategy benefits the platform because of increased total sales and higher revenues. We unravel two mechanisms: the market thickness effect and the quality signaling effect. For the latter, we introduce a systematic framework to empirically establish the quality signaling mechanism with a separating equilibrium, where suppliers prefer gas minting for their high-quality creations. This effectively sends a quality signal that buyers could rely on to recognize high-quality NFTs. This new platform growth strategy provides generic implications for platforms endeavoring to balance market thickness and matching performance.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03573 .</content>

    <title>Does Agglomeration Enhance Property Value?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does agglomeration within a building and/or neighborhood enhance or weaken property value? The valuation impact is unclear ex ante, given that agglomeration tradesoff enhanced productivity at the expense of a more concentrated tenant base. We find that a value premium exists only when agglomeration at both the building and neighborhood levels consists of firms in the same industry. This premium represents capitalized knowledge spillover externalities. Additionally, we show the stock market rewards real estate investment trusts that transact specialized buildings. The valuation consequences arising from agglomeration in the underlying real estate market are thus consistent with the public real estate market.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Real Estate Research Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02773 .</content>

    <title>Spatial Information Sharing on On-Demand Service Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how an on-demand service platform’s mechanism to share demand-supply mismatch information spatially affects drivers’ relocation decisions and the platform’s matching efficiency. We consider three mechanisms motivated by practice; the platform shares demand-supply mismatch information about either zones(s) with excess demand with all drivers (surge information sharing, common practice today), all zones with all drivers (full information sharing), or zone(s) with excess demand only with drivers sufficiently close by (local information sharing). We develop a game-theoretic model with three zones wherein drivers in two non-surge zones decide whether to relocate to the surge zone with excess demand. We incorporate two spatial aspects: drivers’ relocation costs and initial supply across different non-surge zones. Theoretically, full information sharing can hurt the platform’s matching efficiency compared with surge information sharing under low relocation costs because drivers in non-surge zones facing high demand locally do not chase the surge as much. Local information sharing is strictly dominated by other mechanisms in terms of matching efficiency when the supply of drivers near the surge zone is limited and weakly dominated otherwise by surge information sharing. We test these theory predictions in the laboratory with human participants as drivers in an environment where theoretical matching efficiency is highest with surge and lowest with local information sharing. Experimentally, the platform serves fewer customers than predicted with surge information sharing because drivers relocate too often, compromising efficiency in non-surge zones. In contrast, the platform serves more customers than predicted with full and local information sharing, and these mechanisms perform at least as well in matching efficiency as surge. Therefore, sharing demand-supply mismatch information either fully or in a targeted manner (as in local) can help to alleviate coordination problems on a platform. A behavioral equilibrium incorporating loss aversion through mental accounting and decision errors describes drivers’ behavior in our experiments better than the rational equilibrium.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation [Award #2049872].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM) practices, developmental feedback provided by AI does not always achieve its intended effectiveness. Drawing on the Pygmalion theory and the literature on human‐AI interactions, we propose that individuals perceive lower expectation when AI provides developmental feedback, compared to human feedback providers. Perceived expectation positively influences individual learning (i.e., learning motivation and learning performance) and mediates the relationship between feedback provider (human vs. AI) and individual learning. Furthermore, we propose that feedback recipients may perceive higher expectation from anthropomorphic (vs. non‐anthropomorphic) AI, leading to greater learning outcomes. Our findings provide support for these predictions through two scenario‐based experiments (Studies 1 and 2) and a field experiment (Study 3) across a variety of learning contexts. This research sheds new light on the underlying mechanisms of human‐AI interaction and offers practical implications for organizations seeking to utilize AI technology more effectively in employee learning and development.</content>

    <title>Manager‐Rated Cooperative Climate as a Driver of Business‐Establishment Financial Performance: The Role of Employee Racioethnic Diversity as a Contextual Boundary Condition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The present study examined Beus et al.'s group‐based climate‐congruence theory in the context of 670 establishments of a national retailer. The theory proposes that climate‐outcome relationships can be influenced by contextual conditions such as industry and national culture. We extended such logic to the indirect relationship between manager‐rated cooperative climate (through collective employee job performance and employee‐rated cooperative climate) and business‐establishment financial performance. Drawing from the information‐based approach to diversity, we conceptualized business‐establishment employee racioethnic diversity as a contextual condition that can amplify the benefits of cooperative climate for business‐establishment performance by providing a variety of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), experience, and perspectives to bear on work tasks. In support of our predictions, results showed that manager‐rated cooperative climate (Year 1) had a more strongly positive indirect effect on business‐establishment financial performance (Year 3), through collective employee job performance (Year 2) and employee‐rated cooperative climate (Year 2), in establishments with higher versus lower employee racioethnic diversity. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings considering the study's strengths and limitations.</content>

    <title>Leveraging Virtual Contact and Social Networks to Foster Interethnic Harmony</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates whether virtual contact, initiated through a documentary film, can promote interethnic harmony. We carried out a cluster-randomized field experiment involving over 3,300 households across 121 multiethnic villages in Bangladesh. We find that a documentary film, designed to humanize the ethnic minority Santals and evoke empathy among the ethnic majority Bengalis, increased the ethnic majority’s prosociality toward minorities, though the strength of the evidence varies by treatment arm and outcome. Using emotion-detecting software to analyze facial expressions during the film viewing suggests that the documentary elicited emotional responses consistent with empathy. We do not find evidence that the intervention reduced the prevalence of negative stereotypes and discriminatory opinions toward minorities. In villages assigned to target network-central individuals, we find positive behavioral effects on untreated individuals, including Santals, and village-level administrative data suggest a reduction in police complaints in those villages. About five months after the intervention, we conducted a casual work field experiment involving 720 participants from the main intervention. In this task, pairs of ethnic majority and minority participants jointly produced paper bags for a local supplier under a piece-rate compensation scheme. We find positive treatment effects on productivity for both ethnic groups, with effects concentrated in villages where network-central individuals were treated. For the ethnic majority, increased prosociality, and for the ethnic minority, reciprocity or peer pressure may have contributed to increased productivity. Overall, our findings suggest that virtual contact and social networks may help promote harmony within multiethnic communities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on the relationship between leader behaviours and effectiveness is a jungle of complementary yet often conflicting leadership theories that perplexes researchers and practitioners alike, as indicated by various theories of bright and dark side leadership (i.e., leader behaviours reflecting widely considered positive and negative leadership qualities, respectively). We disentangle this jungle by offering a conceptual model that improves our understanding of bright and dark side leadership and their respective effectiveness, based on the concepts of leader character and context integrity. Our theory helps to reconcile the various bright and dark side leadership theories at a general level and suggests critical implications for leadership theory and practice.</content>

    <title>Board Gender Diversity and Firm Financial Performance: Exploring the role of Directors’ Family Affiliations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent studies acknowledge that the contribution of female directors at the board may not be uniform but instead varies depending on their individual characteristics and board context. In this study we focus on a pivotal yet insufficiently explored facet of female directors – their affiliation with the business owning family – and assess its implications for family firm financial performance. Drawing upon the ‘doing gender’ perspective, we contend that family‐affiliation creates a formidable barrier for female family directors, impeding their legitimacy within the board and ultimately reducing their contribution to firm financial performance. Our empirical analysis spanning 127 Italian listed family firms from 2003 to 2019 reveals that family female directors exhibit a less positive influence on firm financial performance than their non‐family counterparts. We further show that this effect is contingent on the presence of male family members on the board – being positive when their presence is low but turning negative when their presence is high. In essence, our study represents an important advancement in understanding the intricate and contingent effects of female directors within a distinct context of family firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Credit rating agencies (CRAs) are less likely and slower to downgrade firms with performance-sensitive debt (PSD) if these downgrades increase borrowing costs. This effect is stronger when CRAs rate their most profitable clients and is not driven by selection into PSD contracts, by borrowers adjusting their leverage, or by borrowers hiding information. Originating banks price the CRAs’ conflicts of interest and sell loans with more embedded conflicts more frequently. In contrast, secondary market participants do not price conflicts of interest to the same extent. The recent settlements between the major CRAs and the U.S. government do not prevent rating inflation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on Internet news reading, we measure fund‐level attention to both aggregate and firm‐specific news and relate it to fund portfolio allocation decisions. In the time series, we find that funds shift attention toward macroeconomic news during periods of high aggregate volatility. Those funds that exhibit stronger attention‐reallocation patterns earn higher future returns. In the cross‐section of fund portfolios, fund attention is positively related to stock holdings. Furthermore, fund attention to a stock increases the value‐add of that position to the fund's performance. This relationship is stronger using fund attention to more value‐relevant news articles.</content>

    <title>Learning from Earnings Calls: Graph-Based Conversational Modeling for Financial Prediction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and policy-oriented abstractEarnings conference calls are a critical channel through which public companies communicate with investors, analysts, and regulators. These conversations contain timely signals about firms’ future risk, yet their length and unstructured nature make systematic analysis difficult in practice. This study develops an artificial intelligence (AI)–based approach, motivated by a body of theoretical and empirical work from finance and accounting, that transforms earnings call transcripts into structured representations, allowing key aspects of managerial communication, such as topic flow, cross-referencing, sentiment, and other semantics, to be explicitly modeled.Empirical results show that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction of future financial risk compared with existing deep learning and large language model approaches, particularly for firms with complex and lengthy disclosures. The findings highlight that nuanced manager–analyst interactions within earnings calls contain value-relevant information for market participants. In particular, cross-referencing, the introduction of new topics, and a more positive tone are associated with lower subsequent risk as identified by the proposed approach. For researchers and practitioners, this work demonstrates how theoretical and empirical evidence on managerial communication can be incorporated into predictive model design, supporting more accurate, interpretable, and responsible use of AI in financial markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the efficiency of a market relative to a non-market institution—an auction relative to a quota—as allocation mechanisms in the presence of frictions. We use data from water markets in southeastern Spain and explore a specific change in the institutions to allocate water. On the one hand, frictions arose because poor farmers were liquidity constrained. On the other hand, farmers who were part of the wealthy elite were not liquidity constrained. We estimate a structural dynamic demand model by taking advantage of the fact that water demand for both types of farmers is determined by the technological constraint imposed by the crop's production function. This approach allows us to differentiate liquidity constraints from unobserved heterogeneity. We show that the institutional change from an auction to a quota increased total efficiency for the farmers considered. Welfare increased by 23.4 real pesetas per farmer per tree, a 6 percent increase in total production relative to the market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Family firms are not a homogeneous group. Thus, we theorize and empirically validate how governance differences among family firms (family governance heterogeneity) influence internationalization, considering the home country’s level of family collectivism as a moderator. Drawing on the bifurcation bias approach, we conduct a multilevel meta-analysis on 33,493 family firms. Our findings suggest that family CEOs and greater family involvement on the board hamper internationalization, but family collectivism improves these relationships. In contrast, non-founding generations promote internationalization independently of this country-level moderator. Our study reconciles the theoretical and empirical inconsistencies in the relationship between family governance and family firm internationalization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substantial empirical evidence shows that suppliers in emerging economies can enhance their technological capabilities throughdirectlearning from technologically advanced foreign competitors. However, suppliers in emerging markets may struggle to learn directly from knowledge about competitors’ products that arenotwidely available on the consumer market. We draw on insights from existing literature, explorative interviews, and anecdotal evidence to hypothesize that firms may resort toindirectlearning channels by leveraging downstream customers as knowledge conduits. Using the Chinese manufacturing industry's import data from 2001 to 2015, our quantitative study reveals the innovation premium of such an indirect learning channel that we term as ‘second‐order between‐supplier learning’: suppliers’ technological capabilities improve significantly when they supply to domestic customers who have imported from their technologically more advanced foreign competitors. Through a qualitative study, we develop a theoretical framework to account for the mechanisms underlying this indirect learning channel, outlining themotivations,contents, andcontingenciesthat shape the effectiveness of second‐order between‐supplier learning. Our findings contribute to supply chain management and organizational learning literature by building a theory of second‐order between‐supplier learning. Our findings could also inform suppliers in emerging markets about technological development and guide policymakers on cross‐border supply chain management.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A long tradition in macro-finance studies the dynamics of aggregate stock returns and dividends using vector autoregressions, imposing the restrictions implied by the Campbell-Shiller (CS) identity to sharpen inference. We develop Bayesian methods that encode a priori skepticism about return predictability while imposing the restrictions. We highlight that persistence in dividend growth induces “dividend momentum,” a previously overlooked channel for return predictability. By combining Bayesian shrinkage and the CS restrictions, we obtain more plausible degrees of return predictability, superior out-of-sample forecasts, and Sharpe ratios, which cannot be obtained by using either shrinkage or the CS restrictions on their own.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the effect of bond investor demand on the financing and investment decisions of nonfinancial firms using granular data on the bond transactions of insurance companies. Liquidity inflows from insurance premiums combined with insurers’ persistent investment preferences identify bond demand shifts in the secondary market. These raise bond prices and reduce firms’ financing costs. In response, firms issue more bonds, especially when they have well-connected bond underwriters. The proceeds are used for investment activities, particularly by financially constrained firms. My findings emphasize that bond investors significantly affect corporate decisions through their price impact.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow traders to express their willingness to pay for quick execution through a public priority fee bidding mechanism. We provide evidence that high-fee DEX trades are more informative and contribute more to price discovery. Using address-level blockchain transaction data, we show that informed traders persistently bid higher fees to secure early execution, revealing a strong willingness to pay for execution priority. Further, analysis of Ethereum mempool data demonstrates that informed traders employ a “jump bidding” strategy, placing high initial bids to deter potential competitors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the impact of patent term on R&amp;D and innovation in the presence of policy anticipation, common in real-world settings. Using a difference-in-difference design, I exploit quasi-experimental variation in U.S. patent term across technological fields due to the ratification of TRIPs agreements in 1995. Despite a general increase in average patent term, in most fields innovators faced a considerable probability of patent term reduction for future innovations. Three key findings emerge: (1) R&amp;D and innovation accelerate more in fields with a higher probability of patent term reduction, i.e., a shorter average patent term extension, before implementation. (2) This heightened activity persists for at least five years post-implementation, driven by indirect effects where the news-related acceleration fosters further innovation through technological externalities linked to cumulative knowledge creation. (3) Conversely, the direct effect of a shorter extension in patent term would stimulate relatively less innovation, absent the indirect effects of anticipation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aspirations may condition the future-oriented choices of individuals and thus may play a role in the persistence of poverty or the effort to break out of it. We run a randomised control trial in remote, rural Ethiopia to explore this and evaluate an intervention which aims to change how poor people perceive their future opportunities, alter their aspirations and, through that, modify their investment decisions. A treatment group was shown video documentaries featuring individuals from similar communities who escaped poverty through their own efforts and serve as relatable role models. Five years after the screening took place, the treated households had increased future-oriented investments in agriculture, children’s education and assets. The results can be explained by an increase in aspirations in terms of lifetime goals. Overall, this research uniquely provides evidence that a light-touch behavioural intervention can have persistent economic impacts on a poor population.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations lose billions of dollars due to inadequate customer service. To improve service, and enhance customer satisfaction, frontline employees’ (FLEs) use of relational communication may be key. During online customer service chats, FLEs provide key information and offer solutions, but they also can build customer relationships through conversations. In this paper, we establish how relational perceptions get evoked in conversations and what influences they have for the outcomes of customer service interactions. Accordingly, we present an empirical field study that illustrates how FLEs influence customer satisfaction by mirroring or complementing four key themes, in line with relational communication theory: intimate communication, task orientation, assertiveness, and composure. Our results indicate that FLEs should mimic customers’ use of intimate communication and task orientation, complement their assertiveness, and exhibit high levels of composure. Moreover, FLEs should emphasize their task orientation at the conversation’s outset, gradually incorporate more intimate communication as it progresses, and adopt assertiveness late in the service chat. These insights, corroborated by four experimental studies, underscore the significance of FLEs’ relational communication. Our findings highlight the value of training FLEs to tailor their word choices adeptly, and leverage the potential benefits of text-monitoring tools which can help FLEs increase relational perceptions and satisfaction among their customers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Don’t Count Non-Targeted Seeding Out Just Yet</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In software markets, the sheer number of available applications makes it rather challenging for any given new one to stand out and be noticed by consumers. Moreover, a push towards privacy by regulators and consumers is making it harder to target consumers. As such, firms have to rely on more non-targeted go-to-market strategies. We explore two popular strategies through which developers can catalyze adoption by helping consumers directly or indirectly learn the value of their products -seeding(free full-feature product giveaways to a subset of the consumer base) andtime-limited freemium(TLF). Seeding, as a business strategy, existed for a long time. On the other hand, the feasibility to offer market-wideTLFbecame mainstream more recently, with the advent of the Internet and a plethora of digital tools. Thus, a natural question emerges - ifTLFrepresents nowadays a feasible and easily implementable strategy for software applications, has seeding approach been rendered irrelevant in these markets? In this study, we provide managerial recommendations on when each of these strategies with a free full-feature consumption component is optimal, based on social and self-learning dynamics, consumer priors, adoption costs, and individual product value depreciation. To that end, under a multi-period parsimonious unifying framework, we show thatSbecomes dominated as free trials enter the picture. We identify two specific market factors that, when present, can induce seeding to be optimal when consumers initially underestimate true product value - (i) user adoption costs and/or (ii) individual depreciation of value by usage. Moreover, we show that these two factors have a moderating effect on the impact of word-of-mouth (WOM) effects on the optimality of seeding. In the absence of these factors, stronger WOM effects alone cannot give seeding an edge against the other business strategies. However, once either depreciation or adoption costs are accounted for, strong WOM effects increase the relevance of seeding (enlarging its optimality region in the parameter space). Our results remain qualitatively consistent under a battery of robustness checks.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Intent-Driven Machine Learning for Fake News Detection: A Referential Domain Adaptation Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fake news negatively impacts business operations across various sectors, including healthcare, retail, and finance. One promising way to mitigate this problem is through automated content moderation using machine learning (ML). However, existing methodologies have struggled to identify fake news due to its inherent challenges—namely, class heterogeneity, concept drift, context dependency, and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel strategy that focuses on the heterogeneous intentions behind fake news. Our approach builds on insights from prior social science research indicating that the intent behind creating fake news may differ from that behind disseminating it. This intent-driven variation influences the syntactic structures of fake news, leading to its heterogeneous nature. Accordingly, we argue that developing an ML model focused on the intent dimension of fake news can help overcome the issue of class heterogeneity, which often prevents effective model convergence. Moreover, since intent-driven linguistic patterns are generally less susceptible to temporal shifts and manipulative alterations, we expect this focus to enhance robustness against the other key challenges—concept drift, context dependency, and adversarial attacks. Grounded in a design science approach, we therefore propose a novel ML framework for fake news detection that centers on identifying and leveraging the intent behind fake news. Specifically, we first develop a domain adaptation model to infer the intent behind fake news, specifically targeting contexts where sufficient training data is unavailable—a common limitation in intent detection. Then, based on the intent detection model, we redefine fake news detection by shifting from binary (fake vs. true) to ternary classification (deceptive fake news vs. non-deceptive fake news vs. true news), thereby reducing the computational burden on ML models tasked with processing heterogeneous information within the fake news category. When evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, our approach demonstrated significant improvements in both intent detection and fake news classification. Robustness checks further demonstrate that our method is less sensitive to distributional shifts in data and is more computationally efficient than baselines. Moreover, post-hoc analyses reveal the underlying mechanisms through which incorporating intent into fake news detection enhances model performance, addressing the key challenges associated with fake news.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the life sciences industry, pharmaceutical firms often collaborate with biotechnology firms to access technological expertise and R&amp;D capabilities, enabling them to accelerate innovation and bring products to market more effectively. In this study, we examine the collaboration experiences of biotechnology startups and pharmaceutical firms in 287 biotech-pharma partnerships and analyze how firms’ experience impacts the likelihood of product commercialization. Experience is defined as the number of times each firm has participated in supply-based activities in biotech-pharma partnerships. We also conjecture that products developed through biotech-pharma partnerships are more likely to progress toward commercialization if both firms have similar levels of experience. However, when the partnering firms’ experience gap increases and they collaborate to develop the product jointly, we expect progress toward commercialization to become less likely. Our results show that both the biotechnology startup’s experience and the pharmaceutical firm’s experience increase the likelihood of progression toward commercialization. Our results also confirm that co-development moderates the relationship between experience gaps and the progression toward commercialization. Based on our findings, partnering experience and experience gaps are critical considerations as pharmaceutical firms engage in co-development projects with biotechnology startups. By focusing on partnering experience, our study contributes to the technology management literature and research on interfirm partnerships specifically in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are exposed to varying levels of supply chain risk and engage in efforts to resolve such risk. This paper examines how disclosures of supply chain risk and resolution during earnings calls affect firms’ stock returns. Using natural language processing, we develop measures of supply chain risk and resolution from quarterly earnings call transcripts for a total of 129,981 firm-quarter observations between 2008 and 2019. We find that higher levels of supply chain risk are associated with lower stock returns around earnings calls, while disclosures of supply chain risk resolution attenuate these negative effects. In particular, stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk quintile are 1.07% lower compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile, and regression analyses indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in supply chain risk is associated with a 0.56% decline in stock returns. The stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk resolution quintile are 0.12% higher compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile. A one-standard-deviation increase in resolution increases stock returns by 0.08%, and to 0.29% for the subsample of observations where the resolution measure is positive. Exploratory analyses indicate that the effect of supply chain risk on stock returns is significantly greater for smaller firms than for larger firms. In addition, when there is evidence that larger firms’ resolution-related statements are mere rhetoric, the effect of resolution on stock returns is diminished.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers often take on debt at different points in time. As a result, debts may be months, if not years, apart in age. In this research, the authors ask whether and how debt age affects installment debt prepayment decisions. While the ideal strategy for prepaying older (vs. newer) debt depends on specific account parameters (e.g., interest rate, monthly payment, etc.), in many circumstances it is financially advantageous to prioritize paying down newer debt. This is because debt amortization (i.e., repayment) schedules often result in reduced interest payments when newer installment debts are paid first. However, across eight studies, including a secondary dataset of consumer loans, the authors find that consumers prefer to prepay older debt first—even when it is financially disadvantageous to do so. The authors term this the “FIFO (first-in-first-out) preference” and demonstrate that consumers prioritize older (vs. newer) debt prepayment because they feel they have invested greater effort (i.e., mental or physical work and energy) to repay it. Accordingly, reducing the effort required to repay an older debt (e.g., through automated payments) or shifting consumers’ focus from invested effort to remaining effort attenuates the FIFO preference. These findings offer implications for theory, managerial practice, and consumer welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Risk absorption, where one party assumes risk to support a partner, is common in business-to-business (B2B) relationships but remains underexplored as a form of relationship marketing investment and in its economic consequences. This study investigates risk absorption in the indirect car loan market, where third-party lenders approve loans for high-risk consumers, enabling auto dealers to close sales that might otherwise fall through. Using a three-year dataset from a loan supplier working with 1,550 dealers, the authors examine both the direct costs of risk absorption (e.g., delinquency payments) and the behavioral responses of dealers. They find that dealers often reciprocate by referring more loans after receiving risk absorption, but these referrals tend to carry higher risk, suggesting opportunistic behavior. Dealer responses are heterogeneous: those with higher operational risk exhibit both stronger reciprocity and exploitation. Moreover, reciprocal behavior grows stronger early in the relationship and fades over time, while exploitative tendencies do not vary with relationship length. These findings provide new insight into how risk absorption unfolds across varying dealer profiles in B2B contexts.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that inter-departmental distance between two departments in a store can significantly impact joint (combined) sales of that pair. Using data from blueprints and sales across 64 stores for 52 weeks, along with an experimental study to test our theorizing, we find a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between inter-departmental distance and joint sales. Specifically, close departments are perceived to be substitutes, decreasing the likelihood of buying products from both departments. As distance increases, departments are perceived as somewhat related but different, increasing their diversity and the likelihood of buying from both departments. As distance between departments becomes large and products are seen as unrelated, the likelihood of buying from both departments decreases. This relationship is moderated when departments have non-identical layouts and when there are larger variety differentials across departments. Accordingly, we determine an optimal store layout using BARON solver by maximizing total store revenue. Our results suggest an increase in weekly revenue of about 4.08% for supermarkets (range of -.67% to 9.50%) and 3.20% for hypermarkets (range of .82% to 8.5%). While strategic locations of departments can help retailers increase overall sales, prior empirical work has not studied the impact of distance between departments at the store level.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Economic Inequality Hinders Consumers’ Access to Peer-To-Peer Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms promise openness and access, yet various biases and barriers shape who gets served. This research investigates how regional economic inequality drives access to peer-to-peer services. Using archival, survey, and experimental data across multiple contexts—including lending, lodging, car rental, and tool sharing—the authors provide convergent evidence that heightened economic inequality within a consumer’s geographic region (community, state, or nation) reduces providers’ willingness to serve that consumer when inequality is a salient socioeconomic cue. This decreased willingness constitutes a form of exclusion rooted in providers’ inferences about potential consumers. Thought protocol analyses reveal that providers infer lower socioeconomic status (SES) and diminished trustworthiness among consumers from more unequal regions, thereby increasing perceived financial risk of serving them. Crucially, the authors demonstrate a boundary condition with practical relevance: a strong platform reputation, such as high ratings, can counteract the negative effects of regional economic inequality, restoring access and interpersonal trust in P2P exchanges.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reward-program promotions: How brands can capitalize on retailers’ temporary reward programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a reward-program promotion (RPP), brand manufacturers offer additional stamps or collectibles when their product is bought, which enables consumers to accelerate toward their collection goal in a retailer-led reward program. Such retailer-manufacturer collaboration has become especially popular in the context of temporary reward programs where consumers have limited time to complete their collection. By examining over 800 RPPs across a broad set of categories in 26 reward programs at six Dutch grocery retailers, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of RPPs, which we contrast to regular price promotions. Our results show a clear positive effect of RPPs on brand sales, comparable in size to that of a 21% price discount, and point to program lock-in as likely mechanism of why RPPs work. RPPs work better in programs with a high requirement to complete a collection, in a later stage of the program, and when other brands in the same category participate with RPPs as well. They are less effective, however, when combined with regular price promotions, indicating negative synergies between the two. Importantly, the drivers of RPP effectiveness are largely similar for category and brand sales, highlighting RPPs’ potential for retailer-manufacturer collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many marketers design their product packaging so that when individual units are positioned together, they form a coordinated and often larger image that spans multiple package faces. We coin the term ‘billboarding’ to refer to this practice that blends product packaging and retail display and whose effectiveness remains unexplored in the marketing literature. We document that billboarding improves consumer responses and operates through a combination of heightened artistic perceptions of the brand display and consumer feelings of serendipity. Using an empirical approach that incorporates field data and experiments, we present eight studies that support this perspective. Because marketers are concerned that the improper implementation of billboarding can backfire, we further explore several moderators related to in-store (disorganized and incomplete billboarding) and design (image type) factors to understand how to maximize its utility. We further examine conceptual fluency as a moderator and show that the positive effects of billboarding are significantly weaker when the inclusion of artistic qualities is conceptually less fluent with a product category. This research offers the first examination of an important marketing tool that may help brand managers circumvent uncooperative retailers and advance actionable insights that are likely to boost consumer responses.</content>

    <title>CEO Activism and Corporate Reputation: How Authenticity and CSR Mitigate Stakeholder Misalignment</title>
    <updated>2026-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Lambert Zixin Li, Sarah A. Soule</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research suggests that the effect of CEO activism depends on its alignment with stakeholders’ political ideology. We examine when and why CEO activism can enhance corporate reputation across the ideological spectrum. Integrating signalling theory with a cognitive perspective on reputation formation, we argue that the reputational impact of CEO activism depends on the firm’s corporate social responsibility (CSR), which fosters perceptions of organizational authenticity. Using a national survey and an experiment, we find that CEO activism improves corporate reputation through perceived moral authenticity. This effect is stronger when firms hold B Corp certification, engage in philanthropic donations, or are perceived as more socially responsible. Although stakeholders rate firms as more reputable when their political ideology aligns with the CEO’s activism, this relationship weakens when firms engage in CSR, thereby signalling authenticity. These findings demonstrate how non‐market strategies interact to shape corporate reputation and inform corporate sociopolitical advocacy among heterogeneous audiences.</content>

    <title>Does entrepreneurship narrow the gender earnings gap?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research has examined whether individuals earn greater returns in entrepreneurship than in wage work but has paid little attention to gender differences in these returns. Using Swedish employee–employer data from 1990 to 2020, we compare individuals' earnings before and after they transitioned to entrepreneurship. We find that women founders earn less than men, yet this gap is smaller than in wage employment. Additionally, entrepreneurship yields disproportionately greater returns for (a) high‐ability women facing glass ceilings in salaried positions, and (b) women in male‐typed industries who encounter greater barriers to advancement in wage work. Together, these findings show that entrepreneurship can enable women to realize greater returns to their human capital, particularly when they face stronger constraints in paid employment.Managerial SummaryThis study examines whether entrepreneurship widens or narrows the gender earnings gap compared to wage work. Using comprehensive Swedish data that track individuals before and after founding new businesses, we show that, although women founders earn less than men in absolute terms, they experience substantially larger earnings gains than men when moving from wage work to entrepreneurship. This advantage is most pronounced for high‐ability women and for women in male‐dominated industries, who face stronger barriers to advancement in salaried work. Our findings indicate that entrepreneurship offers women a pathway to realize greater returns to their skills and experience, yielding disproportionately higher earnings compared to remaining in salaried jobs. For organizations, these results highlight how structural constraints in wage employment can push talented women toward entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Task co‐use and product improvement: An organization design perspective</title>
    <updated>2026-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Johanna Glauber, Tobias Kretschmer</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Co‐using tasks—using the same task to produce more than one product—promises economies of scope. However, task co‐use also ties products together, changing a firm's task network by introducing cross‐product interdependencies. In light of these interdependencies, we identify an unrecognized downside of task co‐use for product reliability: Cross‐product interdependencies complicate task design and increase the risk of malfunctions. Hence, task co‐use may carry a reliability penalty. Second, we propose that the reliability penalty of task co‐use may shrink with experience as cross‐product interdependencies allow for cross‐improvements and therefore potentially higher improvement rates of task co‐using products. We study the US automotive industry and find our predictions supported, indicating that task co‐use is a critical design parameter with important consequences for reliability and product improvement.Managerial SummaryUsing the same tasks to produce multiple products can help firms lower costs and achieve economies of scope. However, this practice also links products more tightly together, creating interdependencies across product lines. These interdependencies can make tasks harder to design and manage, increasing the likelihood of errors or malfunctions. As a result, task co‐use may reduce product reliability—an important but often overlooked drawback. At the same time, co‐used tasks can enable portfolio‐wide improvements— improvements across products. As firms gain experience, problems identified in one product can lead to improvements that benefit others using the same tasks. Over time, these cross‐improvements accelerate product improvement for task co‐using products and can reduce the initial reliability disadvantage. Evidence from the U.S. automotive industry supports these arguments. The findings show that task co‐use is a key design decision that involves meaningful trade‐offs between cost savings, reliability, and improvement. For managers, this highlights the importance of carefully evaluating when and how tasks should be co‐used across products, as these choices have lasting implications for product quality and improvement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that U.S. firms cut imports by 31.8% when their international suppliers experience environmental and social (E&amp;S) incidents. These trade cuts are larger for publicly listed U.S. importers facing high E&amp;S investor pressure and lead to cross-country supplier reallocation, suggesting that E&amp;S preferences in capital markets can be privately costly but have real effects for foreign suppliers. Larger trade cuts around the incident result in better supplier E&amp;S performance in subsequent years and in the eventual resumption of trade. Our results highlight the role of investors in ensuring suppliers’ E&amp;S compliance along global supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does information about the long-run financial costs of reduced labor supply increase mothers’ working hours? We document descriptively that long-term financial factors are not top of mind when mothers decide on their employment level. Moreover, a substantial share of women holds overly optimistic expectations about pension receipt and wage growth under part-time work. In a large-scale field experiment in Switzerland, we randomly assign mothers working part-time as teachers to receive objective information about the long-run costs of reduced labor supply. The treatment increases both demand for financial information and future labor supply plans, in particular among women who underestimate the costs of part-time work. Leveraging linked employer administrative data one year post-intervention, we find that this group of mothers increases working hours by 7 percent. These findings underscore that policies reducing information frictions in labor supply decisions may help address remaining gender gaps in the labor market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) is a potentially important new technology, but its impact on the economy depends on the speed and intensity of adoption. This paper reports results from a series of nationally representative U.S. surveys of genAI use at work and at home. As of late 2024, 45% of the U.S. population age 18–64 uses genAI. Among employed respondents, 27% used genAI for work at least once in the previous week: 10% used it every workday and 17% on some but not all workdays. Relative to each technology’s first mass-market product launch, work adoption of genAI has been faster than the personal computer (PC), and overall adoption has outpaced both PCs and the internet by an even wider margin. Between 1% and 7% of all work hours are currently assisted by genAI, and respondents report time savings equivalent to 1.4% of total work hours. Potential productivity gains vary widely by industry, and firm climate and policies play an important role in adoption patterns.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardello, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Walmart Foundation [Grant 252882].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.02523 .</content>

    <title>Do Consumers Vote with Their Feet in Response to Negative ESG News? Evidence from Foot Traffic to Retail Locations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and, if so, how retail consumers change their shopping in response to firm‐specific negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news. Using an event study methodology, we do not find significant changes in consumer foot traffic in response to negative ESG news, on average. However, the average consumer reacts negatively when such news is covered by national or global media outlets, which elevates consumer awareness. In addition, we provide evidence of the heterogeneity in responses to negative ESG news across consumer groups. Consumers in more ESG‐conscious counties, as measured by county ESG preferences, income, education, and political ideology, reduce store visits in response to negative ESG news. In contrast, consumers in the least ESG‐conscious counties increase their visits in response to negative ESG news. These opposing reactions explain the insignificant average consumer response to negative ESG news. Furthermore, the ESG‐conscious consumers' negative reaction is, at most, modest, dissipating within six weeks. Overall, our findings suggest that firms face divergent responses to ESG activities from different consumer groups, underscoring the divisive nature of ESG issues.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce and validate a novel approach to identifying good managers. In a pre-registered lab experiment, we causally identify managerial contributions by randomly assigning managers to teams and controlling for individual skill. We find that manager contributions are crucial for team success, and that people who self-select into management roles perform worse than randomly assigned managers. Managerial performance is strongly predicted by economic decision-making skill, but not by demographic characteristics. Two validation studies support our experimental results. Participants who succeed in the lab receive more real-world promotions and, in a separate study of retail store managers, skill measures strongly predict store sales. A one standard deviation increase in manager quality increases annual per-store sales by $4.1 million USD (25% increase). Selecting managers on skills rather than demographic characteristics or the desire to lead could substantially improve organizational performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Political embeddedness and family embeddedness are two influential yet distinct areas of entrepreneurship research. In this study, we integrate these two streams of research to focus on family political embeddedness and its implications for new venture creation. Drawing on the social embeddedness perspective and utilizing a longitudinal dataset of 17,084 individuals from the China Family Panel Studies (2014–2022), complemented by 32 qualitative interviews, we examine the relationship between family political embeddedness and entrepreneurial entry, revealing a nuanced interplay. Our theory and related findings reveal a general negative relationship between family political embeddedness and entrepreneurial entry. However, we also unveil an indirect pathway through which family political embeddedness can foster entrepreneurial entry through political news consumption. Finally, we theorize and find that perceived government efficiency strengthens the relationship between political news consumption and entrepreneurial entry. Our work yields important theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using unique, daily, account‐level data, we investigate deposit outflows and inflows in a distressed bank. We observe anoutflowof uninsured depositors following bad regulatory news. Both regular and temporary deposit insurance reduce outflows. We provide important new evidence that, simultaneous with deposit outflows, depositinflowsare first order. Uninsured deposit outflows were largely offset with new insured deposit inflows as the bank approached failure, with the bank increasing term deposit rates. This phenomenon holds in a large sample of banks that faced regulatory action, suggesting that insured deposit inflows are an important mechanism that weakens depositor discipline.</content>

    <title>Model Ambiguity versus Model Misspecification in Dynamic Portfolio Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study aversion to model ambiguity and misspecification in dynamic portfolio choice. Risk‐averse investors (relative risk aversion ) fear return persistence, while risk‐tolerant investors () fear mean reversion, when confronting model misspecification concerns of identically and independently distributed (IID) returns. The intuition is that risk‐averse investors, who want to hedge intertemporally, endogenously fear return persistence, which precludes hedging. A log investor is myopic and unaffected by model misspecification, therefore only worrying about model ambiguity. Our model can generate belief scarring, nonparticipation in equity markets, and extrapolative return expectations. Extending beyond IID returns, we study model misspecification for a mean‐reverting Sharpe ratio.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The link between corporate bond credit spreads and secondary market illiquidity in the cross section has grown stronger since 2005, resulting in a higher liquidity component in credit spreads. Using U.S. investor holdings data, we show that short‐term investors (e.g., mutual funds/exchange‐traded funds [ETFs]) increase trading activities in the secondary market, amplifying the effect of secondary market frictions on prices. We provide a model featuring heterogeneous investors with different trading needs and heterogeneous bonds to investigate the impact of the rapid‐growing mutual fund/ETF sector on the corporate bond market. We find the change in investor composition can quantitatively explain the aggregate trend.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between 2009 and 2011, the Spanish banking system underwent a restructuring process based on savings banks’ consolidation. The program’s design allows us to study how banks’ consolidation affects credit supply and performance. We propose a quasi-experimental analysis showing that bank mergers restrict credit supply and set higher interest rates but also reject fewer applicants and report fewer nonperforming loans. We then estimate a structural model of credit in which banks set interest rates and lending standards. We find that, despite the relaxation in their lending standards, merged banks’ credit performance improved thanks to a significant drop in their screening costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are exposed to varying levels of supply chain risk and engage in efforts to resolve such risk. This paper examines how disclosures of supply chain risk and resolution during earnings calls affect firms’ stock returns. Using natural language processing, we develop measures of supply chain risk and resolution from quarterly earnings call transcripts for a total of 129,981 firm-quarter observations between 2008 and 2019. We find that higher levels of supply chain risk are associated with lower stock returns around earnings calls, while disclosures of supply chain risk resolution attenuate these negative effects. In particular, stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk quintile are 1.07% lower compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile, and regression analyses indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in supply chain risk is associated with a 0.56% decline in stock returns. The stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk resolution quintile are 0.12% higher compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile. A one-standard-deviation increase in resolution increases stock returns by 0.08%, and to 0.29% for the subsample of observations where the resolution measure is positive. Exploratory analyses indicate that the effect of supply chain risk on stock returns is significantly greater for smaller firms than for larger firms. In addition, when there is evidence that larger firms’ resolution-related statements are mere rhetoric, the effect of resolution on stock returns is diminished.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Cross-Platform Spillover Effect of Promotion: Evidence from the PC Game Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform owners employ strategic promotions (e.g., platform-initiated penetration pricing) to enlarge their customer base. Under the conventional price-driven economic logic, such promotions are expected to divert demand for the identical goods away from competing platforms, as extensively documented in the conventional brick-and-mortar store context. However, they can also boost the demand. In environments where customers can easily access the identical goods on competing platforms, the increased awareness by strategic promotion, coupled with other non-price factors, can stimulate the purchases of such goods on competing platforms. As such, the effect of strategic promotions on competitive dynamics remains unclear despite their importance for platforms and today’s intensifying platform competition. We utilize the context of online PC game marketplaces where Steam and Epic Games Store dominate. Using the synthetic control approach, our analysis finds that the strategic promotion by Epic Games Store, which offers selected games for free for a week, rather increases the sales of the identical games on Steam substantially (by 59.2%) during that week. In essence, although consumers could obtain the games for free on the promoting platform, more consumers purchased the identical games on the competing platform than before. To comprehensively understand the drivers and conditions of this phenomenon, we perform complementary analysis based on the Attention-Interest-Desire-Action framework, following the progression of consumers’ cross-platform purchase decision process. Using consumer survey and product review data, along with the decomposition of the treatment effect, our results suggest that the effect is more prominent when the price gap between platforms is small and externalities between users or between goods offered by Steam are high. Taken together, our study unveils a unique aspect of strategic promotion in the context of platform competition and highlights the crucial role of externalities in shaping the competitive landscape of digital platforms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Do More Services Lead to Better Buyer-supplier Relationships? The Unintended Consequence of Manufacturing Firms Providing Customer Solutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature has highlighted the value of the solution business model for manufacturing firms. In this research, we investigate the dark side of providing customer solutions and challenge an assumption held by extant research: that shifting from selling individual products to providing customer solutions enhances buyer-supplier relationships. Drawing on the frame problem view and expectation-(dis) confirmation theory, we examine the impact of provision of customer solutions on customer default. We also explore contingent factors that either magnify or mitigate this effect. Using a longitudinal dataset of 2,218 observations from 446 Chinese listed firms between 2012 and 2020, we find that provision of customer solutions increases the likelihood of customer default. Moreover, we show that this positive impact is stronger in industries with higher turbulence and for firms with greater advertising intensity, but weaker for firms with stronger operational capability. These findings suggest that provision of customer solutions can damage buyer-supplier relationships by reducing the likelihood of meeting customer expectations and increasing transaction disputes.</content>

    <title>Technical Note—Error Noted in “Robust Contract Designs: Linear Contracts and Moral Hazard” by Yu and Kong (2020)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the key claims in the paper “Robust Contract Designs: Linear Contracts and Moral Hazard” by Yu and Kong (2020) is proposition 4. This proposition states that when designing the best robust contract—assuming the agent’s utility function is piecewise linear and concave—the optimal solution involves only progressive fixed payments and linear rewards with progressive commission rates. In this note, we provide a clear counterexample backed by a detailed proof to show that this claim is actually incorrect. We further use numerical examples to demonstrate that the contract design suggested by Yu and Kong can perform significantly worse than expected. Lastly, we identify and explain the specific mistakes in their mathematical proofs that led them to this incorrect conclusion.</content>

    <title>How Do Taxes Affect the Trading Behavior of Private Investors? Evidence from Individual Portfolio Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The removal of an intertemporal tax discontinuity in Germany provides us with a natural experiment to study the causal effect of taxes on individual stock-trading behavior and the disposition effect. Using individual investor transactions data combined with nonparametric regressions and bunching methods, we find that the presence of the tax discontinuity induces investors to adjust their holding periods, which reduces their effective tax rate by 11.3%. We also find that tax effects dominate the disposition effect in the days around the discontinuity and can inhibit it (by about 20%) during the six months preceding the discontinuity. We discuss the consequences of our results for the firms whose stocks are traded and policy implications.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, more than a quarter of the working-age population experiences physical disabilities that shape workplace participation and career outcomes. Drawing on 168 articles, we synthesize the management literature to develop a unifying framework of focal mechanisms, workplace outcomes, and boundary conditions. In doing so, we offer a clear definition of physical disability, long absent from management research. We also highlight the fragmented theoretical and methodological landscape, in which most studies aggregate disability types, overlooking critical heterogeneity. Our review charts a path forward by identifying key gaps, outlining directions for future scholarship, and emphasizing the need for stronger theoretical grounding and methodological rigor. Finally, we discuss implications for policy and practice, underscoring how greater inclusion of persons with physical disabilities can advance various workplace outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using proprietary transaction‐level data on nonsyndicated construction loans, we provide some of the first empirical evidence on the drivers and consequences of bank monitoring through on‐site inspections.  Banks trade off monitoring intensity with favorable origination terms. Monitoring intensity escalates in response to local economic downturns or the bank's financial instability.  Borrowers with negative inspection reports have more draw requests denied, suggesting that monitoring outcomes impact credit decisions. Both the occurrence and threat of increased inspection frequency correspond to reduced defaults. Overall, our results provide empirical support for a substantial body of theoretical literature on bank monitoring.</content>

    <title>When Family Firm Reputation Backfires: The Role of Controllability in Consumer Responses to Negative CSR Incidents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We apply attribution theory to examine how family ownership status shapes consumer attitudes toward companies after negative corporate social responsibility incidents, focusing on incident controllability. Two longitudinal experiments reveal that, when controllability isunknown, consumers infer lower controllability for family firms and thus hold more favorable attitudes toward them than non-family firms. However, when controllability isknown, low-controllability incidents lead to similar attitudes across firm types, whereas high-controllability incidents reverse the effect, resulting in more negative attitudes toward family firms than non-family firms. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that family firms consistently benefit from their reputation and inform stakeholder communication strategies.</content>

    <title>Inference Based on Time-Varying SVARs Identified with Sign Restrictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for Bayesian inference in TV structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) identified with sign restrictions. The linchpin of our approach is a class of rotation-invariant TV SVARs in which the prior and posterior densities of any sequence of structural parameters belonging to the class are invariant to {orthogonal transformations} of the sequence. Our methodology is new to the literature. In contrast to existing algorithms for inference based on sign restrictions, our algorithm is the first to draw from a uniform distribution over the sequences of orthogonal matrices given the reduced-form parameters. We illustrate our procedure for inference by analyzing the role played by monetary policy during the latest inflation surge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the latest monetary policy tightening cycle, capital has been flowing from low-inflation countries to high-inflation countries. This pattern of capital flows is consistent with the predictions of an open-economy model with nominal rigidities where cost-push shocks generate an inflationary episode and capital flows freely across countries. Yet, by raising demand for domestic non-tradable goods and services, capital inflows cause unwelcome upward pressure on firms’ costs in countries most severely hit by these shocks. We find that a reverse pattern of capital flows would have improved the output-inflation trade-off globally, hence requiring a less aggressive monetary tightening in the most severely hit countries and delivering overall welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Do Financial Advisors Charge Sustainable Investors a Premium?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite growing regulatory concerns about potential overcharging of sustainable investors, empirical evidence is lacking. In two controlled laboratory-in-the-field experiments with 415 professional financial advisors from Europe and the United States and an incentivized survey, we identify two distinct but interacting effects. First, advisors charge sustainable investors a premium. This premium persists even when accounting for differences in skill, effort, and costs. Second, advisors impose higher fees on clients with low financial literacy. These factors interact. Sustainable investors with low financial literacy are charged the highest fee, whereas those with high financial literacy do not pay a sustainability premium. Our findings suggest that advisors extract additional fees for sustainable investment mandates but avoid overcharging sustainable investors with high financial literacy.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice(ETP) is committed to advancing transparency, replicability, credibility, and rigor in research. To support this commitment, we encourage authors to preregister their research plans, submit empirical studies as Registered Reports, and engage with our evolving editorial processes, such as Registered Revisions. Drawing on practices across multiple disciplines, we offer guidance for integrating these publication formats into our field. We also provide multiple resources to support authors in adopting these approaches and to address the unique challenges of applying such formats to, for example, secondary data. By more widely embracing the Registered Report approach, we envision a future for entrepreneurship research that is characterized by greater credibility, replicability, transparency, and scientific impact. In this editorial, we motivate and, hopefully, guide future work by making a specific call for manuscripts for a virtual special issue ofETPfocused on Registered Reports, strengtheningETP’s longstanding commitment to methodological innovation. We offer a prospective vision—what we believe would be good for future literature—and our aim is to empower scholars to proactively shape new theoretical and empirical foundations in entrepreneurship research that enhance the credibility and replicability of entrepreneurship research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transformational leadership is recognized for bringing family members together; however, its role in multi-unit complex family firms that rely on nonfamily managers is poorly theorized. We find that transformational family chief executive officers (CEOs) positively affect the performance of business units run by nonfamily managers, suggesting that transformational family CEOs significantly influence nonfamily managers’ behavior. But the efficacy of that influence matters. Political skill enhances the transformational family CEO’s impact on business unit entrepreneurial orientation and financial performance. Business unit entrepreneurial orientation also mediates the relationship between the transformational family CEO and business unit financial performance, particularly when CEO’s political skill is high.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the rise of institutional ownership has influenced firms' political activities. We find that, after the acquisition of a large stake, a firm's political action committee giving mirrors more closely that of the acquiring investor. Consistent with a causal interpretation, this pattern is also observed for acquisitions driven by new index inclusions. The pattern is stronger when firms' management faces contentious proposals in shareholder meetings and may thus need institutional investors' support. We further show that firms' giving shifts away from business-relevant politicians and is strongly aligned with the individual campaign donations of the institutional investors' employees. These results, together with the finding that the effects are larger for more ``partisan" and privately owned investors, suggest that the influence we uncover is driven by institutional investors' own political views, rather than a profit-maximizing strategy for the portfolio firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the efficacy of remote arrangements between CEOs and firms. Such arrangements attract executive talent and overcome labor market segmentation but introduce frictions. Remote arrangements are associated with lower operating performance, firm valuation, and insider reviews. Using the private costs from uprooting the CEO’s spouse as an instrument for the CEO’s decision to seek remote work, we find similar negative effects. The performance decline increases for CEOs who live further away and who cross multiple time zones. The mechanisms include the CEO’s loss of information, short-termism, and consumption of leisure, such as recreational boats and beach homes.

    <title>Bending Without Breaking: How Chinese Patent Examiners Navigate Value Tensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professionals increasingly work within commercial and governmental organizations whose mandates often create tensions with their professional values. Prior research, however, shows mixed findings regarding how professionals respond to these value tensions, with some values being protected and others being compromised. We explore this inconsistency by investigating how Chinese patent examiners navigate tensions between their professional values and governmental pressures to promote domestic strategic innovation under the Made in China 2025 policy. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative interviews with 27 Chinese patent examiners and quantitative analyses of nearly 1 million patents reviewed by 10,304 examiners, we develop a hierarchical framework of professional values. We find that examiners perceive their values hierarchically, distinguishing between core identity-defining values and subordinate operational values. Under external pressures, they attempt to protect their core value of judgmental fairness while absorbing the pressures by compromising their subordinate value of diagnosing diligence. Professional interactions with foreign examiners and experienced patent agents mitigate this compromise by anchoring examiners’ attention to the operational details where diagnosing diligence is embedded. Moreover, our quantitative analyses reveal that compromised diagnosing diligence ultimately undermines judgmental fairness due to interdependence within the value hierarchy. Our study advances the understanding of professional value dynamics under external pressures and provides insights into how experts balance their professional ideals with institutional mandates.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18504 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Price of Attention: Ranking Products for Maximum RevenueHow should an online retailer rank products when customers have limited attention spans? Chen, Li, and Yang tackle this classic problem by extending the well-known cascade model to account for two crucial, real-world factors: customers view only a random number of items, and the firm’s goal is to maximize revenue, not just clicks. This creates a difficult trade-off between ranking popular, low-price items and riskier, high-price ones. The authors propose the “Best-x” algorithm, an efficient method for finding a near-optimal ranking. They prove it guarantees a revenue of at least 1/e (approximately 37%) of that achievable by a clairvoyant who knows each customer’s attention span in advance.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that traditional energy firms are key innovators in the United States’ green patent landscape. These firms produce more, and significantly higher-quality, green innovation. In many green technology spaces, they appear to be influential first movers and to produce ongoing foundational aspects of innovation and commercialization on which other alternative energy producers build. They additionally invest significantly in labor and capital to complement these green innovations. These traditional energy firms, however, receive significantly lower environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores and fund flows and are not rewarded for incremental green innovation. This behavior is consistent with a competitive response by traditional energy firms to preempt obsolescence of current technology by investing in future replacement technologies.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation [Grant SciSIP 1535813] and the Fordham University Gabelli School of Business—PVH Corp.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Patience has been a consistent source of interest and inspiration for generations of thinkers and writers. In this article, I delineate the tenets of a comprehensive framework for understanding patience, theprocess model of patience(Sweeny,Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2025, 29, 145), that positions impatience as a common and unpleasant emotion and patience as a targeted form of emotion regulation. I then outline potential applications of the model for consumer decisions, service experiences, and marketing contexts and close with practical recommendations to optimize consumer behavior in contexts where impatience is likely to arise.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Sequential Sponsored-Products and Off-Amazon Advertising Optimization for Etailers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sponsored-Products (SP) advertising is a popular way to promote products on Amazon. Etailers who have a large catalog of products often create SP ad groups for products with similar attributes. An SP ad group consists of a set of products and a set of keywords, and all the products in the ad group share the same keyword set. These keywords are the ones that shoppers may search for when looking for products on Amazon. In addition to SP ads, etailers may link to external websites for advertising their products, which is called off-Amazon (OA) ads. This study focuses on the optimization of sequential SP and OA (abbreviated as SSPOA) ads decisions for etailers. Practically, many etailers set sales targets for products as manufacturing and logistics are planned ahead of time. Hence, we consider the etailer’s objective as minimizing the expected long-run average cost incurred by advertising and cumulative unmet sales target. We model the SSPOA optimization as a controlled Markovian multi-armed bandit (MAB) process. When the mean of the sales number per unit time (i.e., sales rate) for each product is known, we characterize the etailer’s optimal SSPOA policy for products in an ad group. In reality, etailers may not know the exact means of sales rates. To learn the unknown parameters while simultaneously minimizing the long-run average cost, we develop a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm for the controlled Markovian MAB problem that couples the SP and OA ads decisions. We prove that the regret bound of the proposed algorithm isO~(T), whereTis the total horizon length. Compared with existing literature, our problem additionally considers the regret from applying the estimated control policy and the impacts of choosing non-optimal keyword sets on subsequent states. We also conduct numerical experiments that validate our theoretical results. Moreover, we extend the base model in several directions, i.e., considering unknown transition rates between different sales rate levels, incorporating correlated keyword sets, and learning the optimal policy using Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning under a discretized setting.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Street Orders as an Outside Option: Incentives and Information Disclosure of Taxi-Hailing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taxi drivers face tremendous market competition pressure in the private transport industry after independent contractor drivers (i.e., on-demand ride-hailing vehicles) entered the field, in the era of sharing economy. Taxi drivers have to go online and join platforms to secure demand. However, while ride-hailing drivers have platform orders as the only source of demand, taxi drivers can serve both platform andstreet orders(i.e., people waving on the roadside or waiting at taxi stands), and switch between the two on a real-time basis. The existence of street orders as anoutside optioncreates a decision problem for taxi drivers (i.e., which orders to pick) and forces platforms to carefullydesign incentives(e.g., commission and subsidy schemes) to attract taxi drivers in order to maximize profit. More interestingly, in common practices, platforms do not disclose trip destinations to ride-hailing drivers before customers get on board, to prevent cherry-picking behaviors (i.e., drivers only pick their preferred orders, for example, long-distance ones). However, many platforms provide trip information to taxi drivers in advance, as an incentive to compete against street order opportunities. Thus,taxi drivers need to choose between platform orders with trip information but also pick-up time (i.e., the unpaid driving duration to pick up customers) and street orders without trip information but zero pick-up time.This paper studies how a taxi driver should choose between platform and street orders, and how the platform should design incentives to attract taxi drivers in order to maximize profit. To this end, we build a game-theoretical model and derive optimal strategies. We find that it is optimal for the platform to allow drivers to serve both platform and street orders, rather than incentivizing exclusive service to platform. Since street orders exist as an outside option and protect drivers’ surplus, the platform’s profit will be limited if exclusivity is enforced. In addition, the disclosure of trip distance reduces the subsidy burden on the platform, compared to non-disclosure. Later in the paper, we also check the robustness of our findings under various settings, including homogeneous orders, zero commission and subsidy, distance-based subsidy scheme, and heterogeneous pick-up times.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Implications of Retail Trade-ins on Sales, Returns, and Profitability: An Empirical Analysis of a Jewelry Trade-in Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most retailers offer trade-in programs that allow customers not only to trade-in a used product in part payment for the purchase of a new one, but also to return the new product purchased via a trade-in. In this context, we study how a jewelry trade-in program affects sales and returns of trade-in eligible vs. ineligible new products, and how such programs can be better designed to improve profitability. We conduct an empirical analysis using data from a national jewelry retailer that increased the number of stores offering the trade-in program. Leveraging this expansion, we show that the trade-in program impacts sales and return rates, and find that this impact substantially differs across trade-in eligible vs. ineligible products. For trade-in eligible products, sales increase by 11.4%, and so do return rates - by 4.3 percentage points. For trade-in ineligible products, sales increase by 2.7% and there is no impact on return rates. The provision of a trade-in option reveals a novel trade-off for retailers: it leads to higher sales, but also results in greater returns, which can be detrimental to profitability. Retailers therefore need to carefully assess this trade-off to manage trade-in eligibility of different products. A counterfactual analysis suggests that a selective trade-in program accounting for this trade-off can enhance program profitability by 19%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform Disintermediation: Information Effects and Pricing RemediesIn “Platform Disintermediation: Information Effects and Pricing Remedies,” S. Sekar and A. Siddiq analyze how platforms use pricing and informational levers to combat disintermediation, where sellers transact off-platform to avoid commission fees despite losing payment protection. The authors find that a platform facing a high threat of disintermediation may optimally raise its commission rates in a high-information environment, prioritizing revenue maximization from remaining secure transactions rather than preventing all off-platform transactions. Furthermore, they show that increasing sellers’ switching costs may actually reduce platform revenue by enabling sellers to pass the cost onto on-platform buyers via higher prices. The analysis also demonstrates that a platform can benefit from providing a partially informative signal about buyer riskiness, as full information reduces the value of the platform’s protection and strengthens the disintermediation incentive. Finally, whereas access-based pricing (upfront fees) prevents disintermediation, it may yield less revenue than commissions when seller quality is highly heterogeneous.</content>

    <title>How Do Technology Paradigms Influence Configurations of Contract Characteristics for Success of Inter‐Organizational Outsourcing Projects, 1991–2009?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the distinct configurations of contract characteristics associated with the success of inter‐organizational outsourcing projects across different technology paradigms? We examine information technology outsourcing contracts between 1991 and 2009 to address this question by using a relatively new approach based on qualitative comparative analysis. We consider four technology paradigms: pre‐Internet (1991–1996), pre‐Dotcom (1997–2000), post‐Dotcom (2001–2005), and Cloud Computing (2006–2009). We discuss issues related to adverse selection and moral hazard and identify five key contract characteristics that determine contract success: new contract, existing organizational relationship, long contract duration, fixed price, and competitive bidding. Our analyses document two key findings. First, we show that configurations of contract characteristics for success and failure of outsourcing projects are different across technology paradigms. Second, we identify three themes in configurations associated with outsourcing success—economic imperative, conservative relational, and conservative imperative. These themes extend prior work that draws on transaction cost economics, social exchange theory, and relational exchange theory and identify an increasing emphasis on the relational component to manage contracting risk for outsourcing success over time. From a managerial perspective, we provide context‐sensitive causal recipes to choose configurations of contract characteristics, considering technology paradigms. Together, our findings provide new insights for developing cumulative knowledge for understanding the determinants of success of interorganizational outsourcing projects while opening new avenues for further theorizing and empirical testing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relative pricing of nominal Treasury bonds and Treasury inflation‐protected securities in the presence of U.S. default risk. Hedged breakeven inflation is significantly positively related to U.S. default risk, driven by correlation between shocks to default risk and both shocks to inflation swap premia and Treasury yields. To understand the mechanisms through which default risk is related to inflation swaps and sovereign yields, we estimate an affine term structure model to capture their joint dynamics. Our estimation implies that the interaction between inflation dynamics and default is the primary source of differential pricing.</content>

    <title>The Elephant and Donkey in the Room: Time-Varying Effects of Political Dissimilarity on Social Interactions at Work During U.S. Elections</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Political polarization is recognized as a global risk. Although emerging studies on political dissimilarity at work highlight important implications for how employees behave and interact, findings are at times inconsistent. To provide a more nuanced understanding of when and why political dissimilarity disrupts workplace interactions, we draw on the social identity approach and threat processing to examine how political dissimilarity shapes perceptions of work relationships and behavior before and after election events. Across three studies, we demonstrate that political dissimilarity’s effects depend on political macro events and thus become temporally activated. Study 1, an experience sampling field study during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, showed no significant impact of political dissimilarity on negative interpersonal interactions before the election, but significance emerged on election day and persisted for six days after the election. In Study 2, an online experiment during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, we found that actual political dissimilarity indirectly influenced negative interpersonal interactions via reduced social mindfulness after the election but not beforehand. Study 3, a longitudinal experiment over four weeks during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, replicated the election effect, demonstrating that these effects persisted for at least two weeks and were mediated by cognitive (i.e., perspective-taking) and affective (i.e., empathic concern) subdimensions of social mindfulness. Our findings highlight political orientation as a critical dimension of workplace dissimilarity. Although its impact may be subdued, it becomes pronounced during macro-political events, shaping workplace interactions in significant ways, with the political dissimilarity effects being more easily reactivated in the postelection phase.Funding: Data collection was partially supported by an Add-on Fellowship for Interdisciplinary Economics and Interdisciplinary Business Administration from the Joachim Herz Foundation, awarded to M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm technological research has the potential to spawn multiple applications. Despite recognizing such potential, past literature disagrees on the process through which firms discover and grow new applications out of their past technological research. I examine this question in the context of deep learning, taking a question‐driven approach. Difference‐in‐difference analysis suggests that firms radically increased cumulative investments in past deep learning research upon signals indicating elevated application potential of deep learning. Furthermore, rather than investing in proprietary efforts, firms disclosed their cumulative development trajectories to engage external innovation efforts from which they learn and build. Grounded in these findings, I propose that the discovery and growth of new applications of past research entailsunfolding innovation interdependencewhich motivates firms to co‐evolve with external innovators.Managerial SummaryFirm technological research has the potential to spawn multiple applications. This article examines how firms cumulatively invest in their past technological research to grow new applications in the context of deep learning. Employing a difference‐in‐difference approach, analysis suggests that firms radically increased cumulative investments in deep learning after a shock elevating the application potential of their past deep‐learning research. Furthermore, firms publicly disclosed their cumulative development trajectories to attract innovation efforts from application sectors while actively learning from the attracted efforts to innovate further. These findings suggest that firms engaged, leveraged and co‐evolved with external innovation efforts to discover and grow new applications of their past research.</content>

    <title>Changing Opportunity: Sociological Mechanisms Underlying Growing Class Gaps and Shrinking Race Gaps in Economic Mobility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that intergenerational mobility changed rapidly by race and class in recent decades in the U.S. and study the causal mechanisms underlying those changes. Between the 1978 and 1992 birth cohorts, earnings increased for white children from high-income families relative to white children from low-income families, increasing earnings gaps by parental income (“class”) by 30%. Earnings increased for Black children at all parental income levels, reducing white-Black earnings gaps for children from low-income families by 30%. Class gaps grew and race gaps shrank similarly for non-monetary outcomes such as educational attainment, standardized test scores, and mortality rates. Using a quasi-experimental design, we show that the divergent trends in economic mobility were caused by differential changes in childhood environments, as proxied by parental employment rates, within local communities defined by race, class, and childhood county. Outcomes improve across birth cohorts for children who grow up in communities with increasing parental employment rates, with larger effects for children who move to such communities at younger ages. Children’s outcomes are most strongly related to the parental employment rates of peers they are more likely to interact with, such as those in their own birth cohort, suggesting that the relationship between children’s outcomes and parental employment rates is mediated by social interaction.</content>

    <title>Dual Demands, Attention, and Organizational Learning: Spatial and Temporal Replication of Routines in Scaling Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The replication of routines is fundamental to knowledge transfer and retention in organizations. Because research on routine replication has historically been divided, proceeding within knowledge transfer (spatial replication) or knowledge retention (temporal replication), respectively, our understanding of how replicating routines in new organizational units (knowledge transfer) affects an organization’s capacity to maintain adherence to those routines over time at existing units (knowledge retention) remains limited. Drawing on the organizational learning and related evolutionary economics literature on routines as well as the multiple goals literature and using data on a Fortune 100 franchise chain being scaled in the United States with thousands of outlets opened over a period of 10 years, we examine whether and how knowledge transfer affects knowledge retention. Our primary thesis is that knowledge transfer and knowledge retention create competing demands for limited attention and therefore the need to allocate attention between them. We posit that this gives rise to a negative relationship between the spatial (knowledge transfer) and temporal (knowledge retention) replication of routines, although the effect can be mitigated by organizational learning from experience. We find robust empirical support for our propositions, pointing to important attention and learning mechanisms that shape the organizational capacity to simultaneously navigate knowledge transfer and retention demands, that is, replicate routines across both space and time.Funding: This work was supported by Project PID2024-160548NB-I00 funded by MICIU/AEI /10.13039/501100011033 and by FEDER, EU as well as by by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/00124/2025, UID/PRR/124/2025, Nova School of Business and Economics] and LISBOA2030 [DataLab2030 - LISBOA2030-FEDER 01314200].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16528 .</content>

    <title>Roadmap or Compass? The Value of Prior Collaborative Experience in an Unfamiliar Task Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a temporary team faces an unfamiliar task environment, it should particularly benefit from including members who have collaborated before. Although several studies have made this prediction, it has not been supported empirically. We reconcile this discrepancy by distinguishing between prior collaborations in tightly versus loosely coupled roles, defined by the degree of interdependence among collaborators during prior work. Both forms of prior collaboration can help teammates communicate effectively, aiding team adaptation in new contexts. However, prior collaboration in tightly coupled roles also fosters shared routines that may create inertia and impede adaptation. As a result, we argue that the value of tightly coupled experience declines in unfamiliar environments, whereas the value of loosely coupled experience increases. We test these ideas using data from esports, where professional players with varying collaborative histories are randomly assigned to temporary teams. Unanticipated changes to the game exogenously alter teams’ familiarity with their task environments. Consistent with our theory, we find that tightly coupled collaborative experience enhances team performance in familiar task environments but degrades it in unfamiliar ones. Loosely coupled experience provides modest benefits in familiar environments but substantially enhances performance in unfamiliar ones. Overall, our findings suggest that when environments change, tightly coupled experience can act as a faulty roadmap—anchoring teams to outdated routines—whereas loosely coupled experience can serve as a compass that promotes coordination and adaptation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19399 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that long‐term institutional investors tilt their portfolios toward firms with better Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profiles, in the cross sections of both institutional investor portfolios and the ownership of firms. We test whether several theoretically motivated mechanisms can explain this relationship. Our results that long‐term investors exhibit patience with firms around poor earnings announcements, but quickly sell portfolio firms after negative ES incidents, support the view that long‐ and short‐term investors evaluate information differently. Our evidence shows that limits‐to‐arbitrage play a role, as we find that investors' ESG tilt weakens following regulatory shocks that shorten their horizon.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the assignment of intellectual property rights between inventors and their employers affects innovation. Incomplete contracting theories predict that stronger employer property rights reduce the threat that employee inventors hold up their employers, thereby affecting inventor and invention outcomes. We test these predictions using a U.S. appellate court ruling that shifted the assignment of property rights from inventors to their employers. Within‐employer‐year analyses demonstrate that affected inventors are less likely to retain patent rights, assign patents to new employers, or leave their current employer, all consistent with reduced inventor ability to hold up their employers. Due to the reduced possibility of hold‐up, affected inventors’ innovations are revealed more promptly when disclosed, draw from a broader set of prior patents, and spread more to subsequent patents. If affected inventors do leave their employer, they are more likely to relocate to unaffected states. Furthermore, employers affected by the ruling are more likely to locate their inventors in agglomeration economies and alter their innovation strategy by reallocating activity across states and expanding their innovation portfolios. Our collective evidence suggests that shifting intellectual property rights to employers affects inventor and invention outcomes by reducing the threat of employee hold‐up from the employer's perspective.</content>

    <title>Unequal in the Spotlight: Gender Differences in How Serving on Prominent Firms Affects Directors’ New Board Appointments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does gaining a foothold in the upper echelons of the corporate landscape carry different implications for women and men? We address this question by examining gender differences in how serving on the boards of prominent firms leads to new board appointments. While prominent affiliations are widely recognized as advantageous, research has yet to ask whether these benefits vary by gender. Using data on the population of directors in the FTSE-100 between 2010 and 2017, we find that women are, on average, more likely than men to obtain additional board appointments, consistent with prior literature showing that pressures to increase diversity stimulate demand for incumbent women relative to men. However, serving on more-prominent boards within the FTSE-100 increases men’s likelihood of obtaining new appointments but decreases it for women. Thus, women’s advantage diminishes and eventually reverses, becoming a disadvantage, as firm prominence increases. Our systematic evaluation of potential demand- and supply-side explanations for this pattern finds limited support for both. We propose, instead, that women’s experiences of greater scrutiny and of informal demands on more-prominent boards may shape their willingness to pursue additional appointments. We highlight the dual role of prominent affiliations as sources of both opportunity and constraint, with implications for individual careers and organizational diversity.</content>

    <title>A Tale of Two Banks: When Credit Loss Models Meet Economic Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy makers and researchers are concerned that the expected credit loss (ECL) approach may exacerbate procyclicality. Using administrative loan‐level and firm‐level data in China, we find that banks adopting the ECL model reduced their credit supply and became more prudent in lending decisions after the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, compared to banks using the incurred credit loss (ICL) approach. Our findings are more pronounced for banks that experienced greater loan loss provisions induced by ECL and for firms with higher credit risk. The credit contraction persisted throughout our sample period. We further document that firms more exposed to ECL banks experienced larger reductions in loans, assets, liabilities, and revenue after the pandemic began than those more exposed to ICL banks. These findings support the conjecture that the ECL approach may exacerbate procyclicality.</content>

    <title>Leveraging Employees' Social Capital for Organizational Resilience in Small and Medium‐Sized Enterprises: The Role of High‐Involvement Work Practices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees' bridging social capital (EBSC), conceptualized as the collective bridging social capital that employees bring into the organization, has been recognized as a potential resource for fostering organizational resilience (i.e., the ability to survive and thrive when confronted with unexpected disruptions and challenges), especially for small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in a turbulent business environment. However, the questions of how and when EBSC relates to organizational resilience remain underexplored. Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we propose that knowledge sharing—a dynamic and emergent process where knowledge is introduced, exchanged, combined, and integrated within organizations—represents a key process through which EBSC may be associated with organizational resilience. We further propose that this mechanism is stronger in organizations that extensively implement high‐involvement work practices (HIWPs). Using data from 1131 participants (including top management team members, middle‐level managers, and entry‐level employees) across 175 SMEs in Nigeria, we find that the relationship between EBSC and knowledge sharing, as well as the indirect association between EBSC and organizational resilience via knowledge sharing, is stronger when HIWPs are high rather than low. These findings highlight the importance of HIWPs in leveraging EBSC to enhance organizational resilience, providing practical insights for SMEs seeking to harness EBSC for organizational advantages.</content>
