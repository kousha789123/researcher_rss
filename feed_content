    <title>Litigation risk and IPO underpricing: evidence from federal judge ideology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using federal judge ideology as an exogenous measure of issuing firms’ litigation risk, we document that the initial public offerings (IPOs) of the firms headquartered in more liberal circuits are more underpriced. The effect is mitigated when plaintiffs’ pleading standards are more stringent and is amplified when judges have more discretion in their decisions. The effect is also amplified among deep pocketed issuing firms, while it is mitigated among issuing firms hiring reputable intermediaries in the IPO process. The results of additional analysis suggest that issuing firms located in more liberal circuits are more likely to become targets of lawsuits after their IPOs and that these lawsuits are less likely to be dismissed by the courts and result in larger settlements. Collectively, our findings underscore the salience of litigation risk stemming from the issuing firms’ legal environment in driving IPO underpricing.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Avant-garde Market Driving</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we define and develop the concept of avant-garde market driving, a process whereby producers transform an industry by rebelling against the status quo as a means of social-industrial critique rather than in response to market demand. Avant-garde market driving is primarily driven by a desire to rebel against the status quo, at the expense of widespread acceptance; it involves a multiplicity of like-minded individuals such as other producers, intermediaries and consumers; it occurs particularly in contexts where like-minded consumers seek hedonic or aesthetic novelty or social distinction. Breaking new ground comes with substantial challenges. How do rebel producers overcome the challenges of introducing radically different products and successfully sustain avant-garde market driving? Analyzing the wine market in France, we find that avant-garde market driving is initiated and sustained by symbolic disruption and vertical collaboration among producers and intermediaries. This process can provide a strategic advantage to smaller, low-status firms. Based on our analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for producers and intermediaries who wish to engage in avant-garde market driving.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A war‐related factor model derived from textual analysis of media news reports explains the cross section of expected stock returns. Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects.</content>

    <title>Sustainability Cues Can Delay Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rise of environmental concerns in recent decades, many companies have joined the initiative to advertise and promote sustainable consumption. The current research examines how providing sustainability cues to consumers might have unintended consequences of which practitioners and policymakers may not be fully aware. One pilot study and ten main studies, including two real-choice studies, show that a sustainability cue may delay consumption. That is, in an intertemporal choice, a sustainability cue can increase preference for a larger-later option over a smaller-sooner option. This effect occurs because a sustainability cue shifts a consumer’s temporal focus toward the future, leading to a shorter perceived wait time for the larger-later option. The findings further show that the delay does not emerge among those with strong green consumption values and can be circumvented if firms communicate the immediate need or instant payoff of sustainable actions. By investigating how sustainability cues shift consumer preferences between two options separated in time, the current research contributes to the literature on both sustainable consumption and intertemporal choice. The findings offer practitioners and policymakers guidelines to nudge consumers’ sustainable consumption more effectively.</content>

    <title>Moving toward consensus: an examination of trends in investment fair values</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A primary argument against fair value measurement is the lack of verifiability, where verifiability is defined as consensus in measurement by independent parties. We evaluate this argument by investigating trends in the consensus of reported fair values. Our findings indicate that consensus increased between 2005 and 2019, as evidenced by reductions in the fair value range and standard deviation. Further analyses suggest that enhanced data availability—driven by public dissemination of trade information—serves as a mechanism for this trend. We also document that securities subject to testing by larger external auditors with more resources to take advantage of enhanced data availability are associated with a stronger trend in increasing consensus. Finally, this trend appears to be stronger in situations when management has a heightened opportunity to record a biased estimate. While conventional arguments express concern over management’s ability to manipulate fair values, our results demonstrate patterns consistent with improved verifiability.</content>

    <title>Inventor Commingling and Innovation in Technology Start-up Acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore a form of postacquisition integration by which inventors from the target and acquiring organizations share and integrate technological and organizational knowledge, performing joint research and development. We refer to this phenomenon as inventor commingling. Grounded in the knowledge-based view, we posit that commingling enhances the target firm’s innovation performance by enabling the transfer of the acquirer’s organizational knowledge, preserving the target’s existing knowledge base. We explore how commingling differs from structural integration and how the two forms of integration can be combined for postacquisition management. We posit that commingling diminishes the negative effects of structural integration, whereas structural integration may enhance the efficacy of commingling. Because organizational knowledge is firm-specific and cumulative, commingling efficacy should increase with acquirer commingling inventors’ tenure. To test these predictions, we assemble a large sample of acquisitions to study the effect of these forms of postacquisition integration on acquired entity innovation outcomes. Our results support a positive commingling innovation effect, which is more pronounced under structural integration. A high degree of commingling can mitigate the negative effects of postacquisition structural integration documented in the literature. We use direct flights between the acquisition party locations as an instrument to address the potentially endogenous process of inventor commingling. We find consistent results. Our study raises the possibility of inventor commingling as a distinct form of postacquisition integration, which holds the potential of effectively transferring organizational knowledge and supporting postacquisition innovation output, sidestepping the classic postacquisition integration–autonomy trade-off.Funding: This work was supported by Henry Crown Institute of Business Research at Tel-Aviv University; Mack Institute for Innovation Management at Wharton; Wharton Global Initiatives Research Funding Program.</content>

    <title>Seeing Both Sides: How Shared Experience Can Improve Entrepreneur Evaluations of Investors Through Perceived Empathy</title>
    <updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarly attention in the venture funding literature is primarily devoted to tie selection, with a great deal of that attention focused on the perspective of the investor evaluating the entrepreneur as a candidate for funding. But venture funding can be conceptualized as a long-term, dual-sided matching process. Two mixed methods studies offer support for a specific basis of background similarity that can influence entrepreneur evaluations of investor tie potential: shared entrepreneurial experience. An archival study of 677 entrepreneurs evaluating 408 investors demonstrates that investors with entrepreneurial experience are more likely to be perceived as empathetic than investors without this experience. In turn, entrepreneurs rate investors whom they perceive to be empathetic more favorably than those they do not perceive to be empathetic. Perceived empathy thus emerges as a mechanism that serves to mediate the positive relationship between shared entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneur ratings of investors. A preregistered between-subjects experiment conducted on 481 entrepreneurs exposed to otherwise comparable investor profiles randomized for experience complements the correlational evidence from the archival study with causal support for each of these paths. Shedding light on the key components of perceived empathy, linguistic analyses indicate the extent to which cognitive perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur thinks) and affective perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur feels) mediate the effect. Gender implications are discussed as this work also documents that women are less likely to traverse the path from entrepreneurship into investing, restricting their ability to reap these relational upsides.Funding: This research was supported by faculty budgets at London Business School and Georgetown University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18429 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Homing Alliances and Price Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OTT subscription video streaming industry has witnessed significant growth and heightened competition in recent years, marked by the influx of new players. At the same time, we are observing an interesting phenomenon where competing services are forming new alliances that facilitate consumer multi-homing. For instance, Amazon Prime Video has partnered with services, such as (HBO) MAX and Paramount+, to enhance the combined viewing experience for consumers through seamless integration. We build a game-theoretic model with horizontally differentiated services to examine how an alliance facilitating multi-homing between two competing services affects price competition in the market. We find that the alliance’s impact on price competition depends on the level of content differentiation in the market – competition intensifies when differentiation is high but relaxes when differentiation is low. The alliance benefits the partnering services as long as the differentiation is not too high, and interestingly, may increase the profitability of a third non-partnering service when differentiation is sufficiently low. We show that consumer surplus increases under the alliance, even if price competition is relaxed. We also investigate a focal service’s decision to partner with one of two competing services and show that it prefers partnering with a service that has high quality content but a smaller loyal base. Our research offers insights into the current landscape of the OTT video streaming market and provides implications for both managers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Pick-the-Winner-Picker Heuristic: Preference for Categorically Correct Forecasts</title>
    <updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People routinely make decisions based on predictions made by others (e.g., political pundits, market analysts), so it is in their best interest to identify high-quality forecasts. Experts characterize good forecasting as minimization of continuous error (i.e., predictions close to the eventual outcome). By contrast, the present work reveals that laypeople typically see good forecasts as those that correctly predict an event’s categorical outcome (e.g., the winning team). Using within-subjects, between-subjects, and incentive-compatible designs, fifteen studies demonstrate this “pick-the-winner-picker heuristic” as well as its psychological mechanism: People evaluate forecasts by assigning separate weights to (a) categorical correctness and (b) continuous error minimization, depending on the overall importance of the categorical and continuous dimensions for that situation. Thus, in the common case when the categorical dimension matters most (e.g., sports contests), people prize forecasts that accurately predicted the categorical outcome (e.g., the winner, not the margin of victory). However, when the categorical dimension’s stakes are experimentally reduced, an attenuation is observed. While this describes how people typically evaluate forecasts, crucially, a dimension’s importance is not necessarily related to its diagnosticity of forecaster skill or reliability. Accordingly, the pick-the-winner-picker heuristic may constitute a normative mistake, while framing manipulations help debias judgments.</content>

    <title>Routine Dynamics at a Cardiac First‐Aid Unit: How Context, Emotions, and Identities Drive the Adaptation of Action Patterns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emotions are a catalyst for actions. They are therefore important for developing an understanding of organizational routines as generative patterns of interdependent actions. To investigate how the performances and action patterns of routines are impacted by emotion changes brought about by alterations in the context of routine enactment, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry centring on a diagnostic routine at a hospital's cardiac first‐aid unit. Our findings show that context changes from off‐peak to peak times and vice versa engendered differences in the emotions of doctors and nurses because of, respectively, conformity and non‐conformity between their salient identities and their situated experiences. This triggered actions that produced variation in routine performances and action patterns. Drawing on our findings, we present a grounded model that theorizes two complementary emotions and identity‐linked mechanisms that explain variety and stability in action patterns. We discuss the theoretical contributions and implications of our model and findings for research on routine dynamics.</content>

    <title>The Inclusionary Effects of Performing Work: A Practice‐Theoretical Study of Airport Security Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In contrast to inclusion research that often treats work as a neutral, passive background, this study theorizes the active role of work in producing an inclusive organization. We adopt a practice‐theoretical approach that examines the accomplishment of work activities through their discourses, embodiment, and material arrangements, critically analysing both their inclusionary and exclusionary effects. Through an ethnographic study of an airport security company, we found that performing work along the ends of safety and hospitality played a crucial role in the local, situated formation of a collective of employees, recognition of individual contribution, and emergence of egalitarian relationships among security agents. Building on these findings, we discuss how the enactment of work‐related ends can serve as a key place for inclusion interventions, highlighting the concept of ‘horizon of intelligible actions’ as a central explanation. Furthermore, we emphasize how the interconnectedness – the nexus – of work activities as well as material arrangements are crucial in reinforcing or undermining inclusionary and exclusionary effects.</content>

    <title>Single paper meta‐analysis is unavoidable</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advocate that the multiple studies of a common phenomenon that are featured in a typical behavioral research paper be jointly analyzed to provide a statistical summary of the set of studies as a whole. Indeed, we view such single paper meta‐analysis as unavoidable in typical behavioral research papers because (i) such papers feature multiple studies of a common phenomenon, (ii) such papers contain summaries of those studies, and (iii) statistical summaries of studies (i.e., meta‐analyses) are superior to non‐statistical summaries of them. Nonetheless, the current dominant practice is for such papers to feature separate statistical analyses of the data from each of the studies but to contain a non‐statistical summary of the multiple studies rather than a statistical summary. We believe that this is regrettable and therefore aim to rectify matters. Consequently, we review some considerations about meta‐analysis and statistical analysis more broadly; compare single paper meta‐analysis to traditional meta‐analysis and illustrate its benefits via a case study; discuss and dismiss concern about single paper meta‐analysis; and discuss single paper meta‐analysis and the review process.</content>

    <title>A General-Purpose IT Intervention to Improve Human Decision Making, Strengthen Passwords, and Reduce Receptivity to Misinformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <title>Executive Pay Cuts and Executive Turnover</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of executive pay cuts on executive turnover. While previous research has largely focused on the drivers of pay increases of top management team (TMT) members or the effects of their relative pay standing on executive behavior, the prevalence and consequences of pay cuts have received limited attention. Drawing on temporal comparison theory, I argue that executive pay cuts are positively associated with executive turnover. I then propose that the impact of pay cuts on executive turnover depends on contextual cues that influence how executives interpret these cuts. Specifically, I argue that the effect is stronger for salary cuts than for pay‐for‐performance (PFP) cuts. I also argue that the impact of a pay cut is stronger when an executive is paid below the TMT pay level and when few other TMT members experience similar cuts. I test these predictions on a large longitudinal sample of U.S. firms and find empirical support. These results highlight the importance of temporal comparisons in executive pay evaluation processes.</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <title>A tale of two biases: Unpacking the relationship of overestimation and overprecision on firm performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate public support and venture capital (VC) investment in academic startups. Government support may enable follow‐on investment by providing a quality signal to investors. This signal is especially important for academic startups, which face large funding gaps due to their complexity, cutting‐edge nature, and uncertainty regarding the founders' management capabilities and commitment. Using a panel of startups in Germany, our analyses confirm that academic startups are more likely to obtain follow‐on VC investment after receiving public support than non‐academic startups. Further, this effect is limited in time, lasts longer for academic startups, is concentrated in high‐tech manufacturing firms, and is stronger for investments from business angels. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking to foster academic entrepreneurship through policy programs and VC investment.Managerial SummaryObtaining seed and growth capital is essential for potentially highly innovative startups. We show that startups that obtain public support are more likely to receive VC funding and that this effect is stronger for startups with academic founders, approximately twice as large. We further show that this benefit is limited in time, concentrated in the high‐tech manufacturing industry, and more salient for business angel financing than for investment by independent VC funds or corporate VCs. For founders of academic startups, our results imply that acquiring public support might enhance the chances of attracting follow‐on financing.</content>

    <title>Understanding Talent in Foreign Subsidiaries: A Review, Synthesis, and Way Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations are strategically important, requiring them to tailor their human capital resources to specific needs. Although talent serves as the micro‐level foundation of subsidiaries' organizational‐level human capital resources and strategic outcomes, the current literature is fragmented and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is known, what remains unknown, and what future research should explore about talent in subsidiaries. To this end, we synthesize the literature on talent in subsidiaries over the past two decades, mapping it onto the model of human capital resources emergence. First, we build on existing classifications by integrating the recognized distinction between headquarters‐assigned or locally hired talent with talent nationality, providing a structured perspective that better reflects the realities of subsidiary talent. Second, we examine how talent's individual knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) and social interactions evolve into four subsidiary‐level human capital resources, which in turn contribute to a variety of strategic subsidiary outcomes. Finally, we conclude our review with a future research agenda.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <title>Perceptions of knowledge transferability and entrepreneurial entry: The role of firm‐initiated turnover</title>
    <updated>2025-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the understudied effects of perceived non‐transferable knowledge on labor market choices after firm‐initiated turnover. Using a large, nationally representative dataset, I assess how workers' perceptions of knowledge transferability, expectations to remain at a firm, and type of turnover experienced correlate with the decision to engage in entrepreneurship. I find that the release of workers with perceived non‐transferable knowledge into the external environment through firm‐initiated turnover reliably foreshadows entrepreneurship, especially as workers' prior expectations to continue wage employment at a source firm increases. This finding indicates that beyond necessity, opportunity and financial resources, workers' self‐perceptions of their human capital and unfulfilled career expectations matter to the choice of entrepreneurship. It also suggests that firm‐initiated turnover may be a form of knowledge divestiture with important ex‐post implications when workers' perceptions of transferability align with reality.Managerial SummaryManagers often overlook the role of employees' self‐perceptions in shaping post‐turnover career decisions. This study highlights that workers who perceive their knowledge as non‐transferable—skills and expertise they believe cannot easily be applied to other employers—are more likely to pursue entrepreneurship following firm‐initiated turnover. This trend is particularly pronounced among workers who expected to remain in wage employment but were unexpectedly terminated. Firm‐initiated turnover, while serving to shed human capital, can inadvertently encourage the creation of entrepreneurial ventures that may compete with the firm. To mitigate unintended outcomes, firms should (a) recognize the strategic implications of firm‐initiated turnover as a form of knowledge divestiture, with implications for both the firm and the broader market, (b) reevaluate how they manage exits for employees with the firm's specialized knowledge, to reduce the risk of competitive ventures, and (c) engage in open dialogue to align employee expectations with organizational strategies, considering retention or redeployment options for those at risk of a forced exit. By understanding how workers' perceptions and unmet expectations influence their career paths, firms can make more informed decisions about human capital management and turnover strategies, potentially reducing unintended competitive risks while fostering long‐term relationships with former employees.</content>

    <title>Bridging the Divide: How Dual‐Background Leaders Unlock Returnee Innovation in Politically Connected Chinese Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how firm leadership diversity influences innovation, focusing on the interplay between returnee leaders – those with international experience – and politically connected leaders. While returnee leaders introduce globally derived innovation practices, their efforts often clash with the state‐aligned agendas of politically connected leaders. By integrating bridging mechanisms into upper echelons theory, we introduce dual‐background leaders – executives with both political and international experience – to bridge these divergent cognitive logics. Through a longitudinal analysis of Chinese publicly listed firms from 2006 to 2016, we find that the positive effect of returnee leaders on innovation performance is significantly weakened in firms with high political connectivity, especially in the absence of dual‐background leaders. Conversely, firms that effectively integrate dual‐background leaders are better positioned to reconcile competing innovation agendas and unlock the synergistic potential of leadership diversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine hidden orders usage by algorithmic traders (ATs) and nonATs. ATs extensively use hidden orders but of smaller size than nonATs, who are the primary contributors to hidden volume. ATs’ relative share of hidden volume decreases with volatility, adverse selection costs, and the relative tick-size. Proprietary ATs (HFTs), who differ from agency ATs (AATs) in their information sets and potential gains from trade, hide orders to reduce competition for liquidity provision, whereas AATs use hidden orders to conceal information in their more informed orders and manage picking-off risk. Finally, superior technology provides limited benefit for hidden order execution.</content>

    <title>The Determinants of ESG Ratings: Rater Ownership Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how common ownership affects Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—an important research question given the increasing use of these ratings in investment decisions and corporate evaluations. We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</content>

    <title>Incentive alignment in ecosystems: The role of complementarity types and multi‐sided bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alignment of incentives to improve value creation in ecosystems is crucial to their growth and survival. We examine how two fundamental ecosystem features affect alignment: types of complementarities and their interplay with multi‐sided bargaining over value. Using a formal model, we find that multi‐sided bargaining typically causes misalignment, in patterns that vary dramatically depending on the type of complementarities. For instance, we find that multiplicative complementarities typically entail weak alignment among participants. In contrast, when value creation is constrained by the weakest component, alignment can be alternatively very strong or very weak. We also find that the starting levels of participants' functionality matter. This suggests new avenues for assessing ecosystem performance and the potential for alignment among participants.Managerial SummaryManagers of firms operating in ecosystems need to understand the factors that make their partners aligned with the objective of increasing the ecosystem's value creation. Our research shows that, under multi‐sided bargaining, a major driver of incentive alignment is the type of complementarity between ecosystem's components, that is, how the different pieces of the ecosystem contribute to value creation. Depending on the complementarity type (multiplicative, additive, and weakest‐link), and ecosystem partners' starting levels of functionalities, we show which combinations are intrinsically favorable for aligning development incentives and which ones may undermine alignment. These findings can serve as a guide to diagnose the potential for misalignment among ecosystem partners and how much value creation is at stake.</content>

    <title>Mobilizing the silent majority: Discourse broadening and audience support for entrepreneurial innovations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs operating in a public interactional domain face a unique communicative challenge: they must leverage conversations with a small subset of vocal discursive partners to mobilize support from a broader base of silent audiences observing these exchanges. I propose that entrepreneurs who engage with these vocal discursive partners using what I refer to asdiscourse broadeningare more likely to successfully gain support from the broader silent audience. Using a computational linguistics model to analyze discourses on an online platform featuring entrepreneurial innovations, this study finds an inverted U‐shaped relationship between discourse broadening and support from silent audience members. This relationship is moderated by the similarity between the interpretative lenses of discursive partners and silent audience members, which influences the trade‐off between the benefits and costs of discourse broadening.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face the critical challenge of persuading broader audiences to support their novel ideas despite having limited opportunities to interact with them directly. This article examines how entrepreneurs can strategically engage with their immediate conversational partners on online platforms to gain support from a wider base of silent observers. The findings show that entrepreneurs must carefully balance the extent to which they broaden the discourse with their conversational partners to maximize support from the broader audience. They also need to tailor the level of discourse broadening based on how much their conversational partners represent the views of silent observers. These insights reveal a discursive strategy that entrepreneurs can leverage on online platforms to increase the likelihood of success in commercializing their innovations.</content>

    <title>A double-edged sword: materiality classifications of sustainability topics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has classified sustainability topics as material or not material for investors. We leverage the staggered release of the SASB classifications from 2013 to 2016 to examine whether and how they prompt changes in U.S. firms’ sustainability performance. We measure sustainability performance using RepRisk scores, which reflect environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incidents. We find that RepRisk scores on sustainability topics classified as material decrease following the release of SASB classifications. Conversely, incident scores on nonmaterial sustainability topics increase. This suggests that firms improve their sustainability performance on topics the SASB deems relevant for investors while simultaneously performing worse on irrelevant topics. Firms adjust their internal sustainability policies to mirror these changes. The changes in sustainability performance occur primarily through two channels. We document that higher exposure to the classifications from shareholder pressure and sustainability-linked executive compensation prompts managers to prioritize sustainability topics classified as relevant for investors over irrelevant ones.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Temporal Patterns of New Product Introductions and IPO Value: The Importance of Recency, Dispersion, and Asymmetry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s innovation activity is often judged by the number and type of new products it launches, butwhenthese products are introduced may be equally important, especially before going public. This research investigates how the temporal pattern of new product introductions (NPIs) influences a firm’s initial public offering (IPO) value. The analysis uses data from 298 firms that went public between 2006 and 2023, and focuses on three patterns of timing: recency (how recently the latest product was launched before the IPO), dispersion (the degree to which NPIs before the IPO are spread out over time), and asymmetry (how disproportionately NPIs were launched over time before the IPO). Results demonstrate that firms with more dispersed NPIs achieve higher IPO value, whereas firms that introduce a product just before the IPO or introduce several new products disproportionately closer to the IPO tend to perform worse. Findings show that 1% increases in recency, dispersion, or asymmetry result in a 1.34% decrease, 3.65% increase, and 1.03% decrease, respectively, in IPO value, and these vary depending on the firm’s industry growth and product innovativeness. Results provide new insights for theory and practice, highlighting that innovation timing is a key determinant of IPO performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Psychological Ownership and Territorial Behaviors in Rental Transactions: Why “Who” You Rent from Matters</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The phenomenal growth in rentals, with the advent of access-based platforms, has made it possible for consumers to rent products from person providers (e.g., Alex on Airbnb) and company providers (e.g., Apex Vacations on Airbnb). But does “who” a consumer rents from matter? Across nine experiments (including one with real behaviors), we demonstrate that despite the product being the same, consumers differ in how they feel about the product depending on “who” they are renting from. Consumers feel stronger psychological ownership for the product when renting from company providers than person providers. These feelings of psychological ownership drive consumers to engage in “territorial” behaviors – actions that assert their claim on the rented product (e.g., moving furniture in a rental cabin). Consequently, consumers are more willing to exhibit such behaviors when renting from company providers than person providers. These behaviors impose real costs on rental providers through increased operational burdens and property damage, as exemplified through additional analyses of providers’comments on Airbnb’s community platform and interviews with providers. We further identify strategies to mitigate consumers’ territorial behaviors by altering consumers’ feelings of psychological ownership through its antecedent in the rental context: provider’s connection to the rental product.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Cryptocurrencies*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores U.S. public firms’ cryptocurrency holdings and accounting practices from 2013 to 2022 against the backdrop of the recently enacted crypto accounting rule, ASU 2023‐08. Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manipulated consumer reviews are a growing concern for digital platforms, undermining trust and distorting market outcomes. This study analyzes data from the Apple App Store to assess how both positive and negative manipulated reviews—later filtered by the platform—affect app sales rankings. Surprisingly, both one-star and five-star manipulated reviews initially boost app rankings, even when one-star reviews are intended to harm competitors. These effects can persist for weeks and take up to six months to reverse through platform filtering. Using text analysis, we find that negative manipulated reviews are linguistically more distinguishable from organic ones than are positive manipulated reviews, making them easier for consumers to spot. Our results show that review volume often outweighs valence in influencing consumer behavior, and that manipulated reviews have stronger effects on free apps, gaming apps, and apps from large developers. These findings underscore the urgency for platform managers to invest in faster, more accurate filtering systems, and highlight the need for policymakers to strengthen governance mechanisms to protect marketplace integrity and consumer trust.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For sellers of experience goods, consumer uncertainty threatens profits. Resale platforms and enhanced consumer learning are popular tools to manage this uncertainty, but their impacts differ significantly and require tailored strategies. Our research reveals critical nuances overlooked by prior studies: the resale platform’s negative effect is often underestimated because of its indirect influence on consumer waiting behavior, whereas consumer learning can harm sellers of high-cost goods when consumers are impatient. Critically, the profitability and environmental outcomes depend on production costs and consumer patience. Encouraging consumer learning creates a profit-environment win–win with patient consumers, whereas resale platforms excel with impatient consumers and high costs. Combining both mechanisms benefits sellers only when consumers are patient and costs are moderate ([Formula: see text]"). Key strategic imperatives emerge: (i) resale behavior: encourage selectively (beneficial mainly for high-cost goods), minimizing resale discounts; (ii) learning behavior: nurture consumer patience and avoid rushing purchases, especially for premium goods; and (iii) product upgrades: avoid frequent, minor updates. Sellers must move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches, aligning their uncertainty management (resale, learning, upgrades) with product economics and consumer patience to optimize profits and sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study of nascent entrepreneurship lies at the core of entrepreneurship scholarship, offering critical insights into how both entrepreneurs and ventures emerge through a contextually embedded process. This review synthesizes findings from 95 peer-reviewed articles that employ the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), two comprehensive longitudinal datasets specifically focusing on nascent entrepreneurship. Using thematic analysis, we synthesize the literature into three core dimensions—the entrepreneur, the entrepreneurial process, and the venture—and emphasize the role of context. Although research on individuals and ventures is relatively well developed, the process dimension remains underexplored, and contextual influences warrant further investigation. We also identify key methodological challenges—particularly related to construct validity—as well as emerging methodological innovations. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, underscoring the need for more large-scale initiatives and opportunities to re-engage with the PSED’s untapped potential to advance understanding of entrepreneurial emergence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study adopts a Bourdieusian lens to examine how founders’ social class origin influences venture performance through a central aspect of entrepreneurial habitus—risk-taking. In Study 1, we find that risk-taking mediates the relationship between social class origin and venture performance, advantaging those from higher social class origins. In an archival dataset, we show that an alternative measure of childhood social class similarly predicts risk-taking among self-employed individuals. In Study 2, we investigate how field-specific social capital moderates this pathway through founders’ social networks. These findings advance understanding of how early-life social class conditions shape entrepreneurial behavior and performance and imply the need for more nuanced and class-inclusive support within entrepreneurial ecosystems.</content>

    <title>Auditor-provided nonpublic signals of misreporting and CFO dismissal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research suggests that board members value financial reporting quality because executive dismissal often follows low reporting quality events. However, inferences about the board’s demand for reporting quality in these studies are confounded by board members’ reputation incentives because the events examined are public (e.g., restatements). We investigate boards’ demand for reporting quality by exploiting aprivatesignal of misreporting: audit adjustments communicated to the Board by the external auditor. We first survey 29 audit committee chairs to understand whether boards use audit adjustments in their oversight of management and then conduct an empirical investigation to answer our research question. We find an increased likelihood of CFO dismissal following audit adjustments. This association is driven by adjustments that reduce income and by firms with better board oversight. These findings suggest that boards proactively use nonpublic signals of reporting quality and incorporate information from auditors into their monitoring function.</content>

    <title>It's Not Just What You Say, but How You Say It: The Effects of Enterprise Social Media on Service Management, Through the Lens of Signaling Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Frontline service workers are crucial to service delivery and have been a long‐standing focus of research, with scholars and practitioners alike maintaining an interest in their effective management. As technology increasingly transforms this context, the way in which managers in service organizations communicate with frontline workers has also evolved, with a notable increase in the use of enterprise social media (ESM). This study investigates the idea that it is not just ‘what’ management says (service‐oriented messaging) but ‘the way’ they say it (via ESM) that matters. Drawing on interviews with 36 informants and guided by signaling theory, this study explores how ESM influences customer‐focused signaling via management communication and HR implementation in the frontline service context, fostering conditions for a service climate. Findings reveal that ESM's affordances can potentially enhance service climate by strengthening HR system strength, promoting voice, and fostering informal leadership. However, risks such as manager role ambiguity, perceptions of mixed messaging, and over‐surveillance are also identified. This study highlights the double‐edged implications of ESM in its shaping of service‐oriented signaling and emphasizes the importance of the signaling environment in realizing its benefits while mitigating its risks.</content>

    <title>A Real Options Reasoning Perspective on Entrepreneurs’ Decision-Making Over Time</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances real options reasoning (ROR) logics by examining how entrepreneurs make sequential decisions under varying uncertainty. Although ROR has been conceptualized as a useful decision-making framework, its boundary conditions and theoretical applications remain underspecified. Through a multistage experimental design with 181 entrepreneurs and an archival study, we demonstrate that entrepreneurs employ different ROR logics based on both the initial level of uncertainty and its subsequent directional changes. This advances ROR by establishing its boundary conditions, demonstrating when entrepreneurs do and do not employ ROR logics, and revealing how the directionality and magnitude of uncertainty changes influence entrepreneurial decision-making.</content>

    <title>Core or periphery: Examining where to allocate heterogeneous inventors and the impact on firms' innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms should allocate their inventors to network locations to achieve their best innovation performance. We use an NK model to model the interactions between key factors that influence a firm's innovation: (a) individuals' embeddedness within the firm's network, (b) individuals' heterogeneity across their search distance as well as their adoption (i.e., imitation) propensity, and (c) the complexity of the firm's landscape. We find that in high‐complexity landscapes, firms benefit from allocating low‐adopter agents to the core and high‐adopters to the periphery, thereby promoting more independent search at the core. The opposite is true for low complexity landscapes. We further find that when agent types are unknown, individuals should be allocated based on their adoption propensity versus search distance.Managerial SummaryWhere should firms locate their heterogeneous inventors within their networks? Simulating a complex innovation landscape, our study focuses on the interaction of three essential factors that may influence firms' innovation: the location of inventors in the core (embedded position) or periphery of a firm's structure, the distance inventors search for solutions, and the adoption propensity with which inventors will imitate their peers' solutions versus being independent and following their own trajectory. Our results show that firms benefit by placing independent searchers who also search far at the core of the firm when facing highly complex problems, and at the periphery otherwise. Though search distance and adoption propensity have substitutive effects on innovation performance, firms should allocate based on inventors' adoption propensity to lower innovation‐performance variance.</content>

    <title>Addressing Gender in Authenticity and Inclusion at Work: Nuancing Conservation of Resources Theory With Social Role Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we elucidate how gender may influence the mechanisms and conditions under which perceived inclusion climate facilitates authenticity at work. We nuance conservation of resources theory with social role theory to argue that perceived inclusion climate acts as a caravan passageway through which authenticity at work can be fostered, yet how inclusion climate relates to authenticity is different for men versus for women. We hypothesize that men will feel more authentic when they perceive their organization to be inclusive because such perceptions enable them to feel unique, whereas women will feel more authentic when in inclusive organizations because such environments foster their belongingness. In a time‐lagged study, we find that for women, it is belongingness that is the mediating process, whereas for men, it is both uniqueness and belongingness. We additionally propose, and find, that structural empowerment, as an HRM contextual resource caravan, moderates the relationships between perceived inclusion climate and belongingness/uniqueness for women but not for men. Here, structural empowerment is particularly important for women's needs for belongingness and uniqueness when they perceive their organization be not very inclusive. Overall, we contribute to workplace inclusion and authenticity literatures by underscoring the need to consider gender differences in more depth.</content>

    <title>Status-Amplified Deterrence: Paul Manafort’s Prosecution Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents often struggle to deter organizational deviance. We propose a theory of “status-amplified deterrence” wherein enforcement’s deterrent effects are amplified when carried out against high-status organizational actors. First, this enforcement is interpreted as willingness and ability for far-reaching enforcement. Next, amplified deterrence occurs as these episodes become widely known through (1) extensive media coverage and (2) the marketing efforts of third-party compliance advisors. We examine this theory in the context of the U.S. Department of Justice’s enforcement against Paul Manafort for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that enforcement against Manafort caused a widespread, sustained, and economically significant reduction in FARA noncompliance. We show supplementary evidence consistent with the idea that deterrence was amplified in significant part by media attention and by law firms referencing the episode while successfully marketing FARA advisory services. We contribute to literature illuminating how organizations, in conjunction with third-party compliance advisors, adjust deviant activities in response to shifting regulatory environments.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18754 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build cross‐sections of asset returns for a given set of characteristics, that is, managed portfolios serving as test assets, as well as building blocks for tradable risk factors. We use decision trees to endogenously group similar stocks together by selecting optimal portfolio splits to span the stochastic discount factor, projected on individual stocks. Our portfolios are interpretable and well diversified, reflecting many characteristics and their interactions. Compared to combinations of dozens (even hundreds) of single/double sorts, as well as machine‐learning prediction‐based portfolios, our cross‐sections are low‐dimensional yet have up to three times higher out‐of‐sample Sharpe ratios and alphas.</content>

    <title>Surviving as a Vegan in a World of Omnivores: Relational Fractures in Shared Practices</title>
    <updated>2025-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research documents the role of the misalignment of practice elements in practice habituation and change. We extend this literature by demonstrating the understudied role of practice relationality. Locating our empirical work in veganism, a context that encompasses a bundle of interrelated practices, we show how people who adopt veganism manage the relationality of their food-related practices (e.g., eating, cooking, and shopping for food) during shared moments. Building on interview, secondary, and netnographic data on people who pursue veganism, we demonstrate that changes in shared practice performances cause relational fractures. We pinpoint relational fractures that hinder practitioners from smoothly performing shared practices in three contexts: co-performance, co-learning, and the marketplace. To repair practice relationality, vegan consumers enact four relational competences, which we identify as decoding, decoupling, divesting, and chameleoning. These competences can repair some relational fractures while aggravating others. When vegan consumers fail to acquire any competence, however, they end up reverting to their old omnivorous performances. Our paper contributes to practice theory by conceptualizing the role of practice relationality in practices, introducing the concept of relational competence as a necessary element for performance (re)rehabituation, and demonstrating the role of practice intelligibility in the co-performance of shared practices.</content>

    <title>Concealing Prices: How Delayed Price Disclosure Influences Consumer Purchase Decisions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article presents the first systematic empirical investigation into a longstanding question in retail: Is it better to display prices upfront or reveal them later in the purchase process? Two large-scale field studies demonstrate that delayed price disclosure can either increase or decrease sales. Supporting lab studies reveal that one plausible explanation is that a price delay allows price beliefs to shift consumers’ internal reference prices upward or downward, creating either positive or negative price expectation disconfirmations when prices are revealed. When consumers anticipate prices should be expensive (e.g., from premium brands or upscale stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations upward, making purchases more likely when prices are revealed. Conversely, when consumers anticipate prices should be inexpensive (e.g., sales events or discount stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations downward, making purchases less likely when prices are revealed. Our findings offer retailers actionable insights on when to reveal prices to customers. In doing so, the authors contribute to the literature on price obfuscation and challenge the conventional wisdom that shopping experiences should always minimize friction. (184 words)</content>

    <title>Strategic (Inconsistent) Disclosures and Sophisticated Investors: Evidence from Hedge Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent SEC regulations require that qualified hedge fund advisers provide their investors with narrative disclosures of their business and operations. We find that 40% of these disclosures omit or de‐emphasize information regarding advisers' operational and investment risks when compared to other sources of public information. Funds with such “inconsistencies” are associated with predictably lower fund performance but do not differ in their fund flows, flow‐performance relation, ownership structure, or management fees. These results are consistent with investors being subject to limited strategic thinking, which prevents them from fully unraveling the implications of strategic omissions. This, in turn, contributes to advisers' successful use of discretion to de‐emphasize information with adverse performance implications. Our findings suggest that information processing frictions can facilitate nondisclosure, even in markets with sophisticated investors.</content>

    <title>Is Prevention Better Than Cure? Effects of Cyber Risk Disclosures on Shareholder Response to Breaches</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As digitalization increases firms’ exposure to cyber risks, corporate disclosures about how these risks are managed are becoming more common and influential. This study examines 1,912 breach incidents affecting public companies to understand how shareholder reactions differ depending on the type of cyber risk strategies disclosed. We find that, although breaches generally lead to stock price declines, firms that previously disclosed preventive strategies, such as efforts to avoid breaches, experience significantly smaller losses in market value. Conversely, disclosing mitigative strategies, focused on damage control after a breach, amplifies the negative impact. These effects arise from shareholders’ loss aversion: They respond more favorably to firms perceived as trying to prevent harm rather than simply reacting to it. These findings suggest that managers should focus cyber risk disclosures on credible, prevention-oriented strategies to build investor confidence and minimize financial fallout after a breach. Additionally, our findings advise against using cyber risk disclosures as tools for impression management. Managers should ensure these disclosures accurately reflect the firm’s cyber risk management practices, as failing to do so can undermine the economic benefits of emphasizing preventive strategies.</content>

    <title>Creating Radical Technologies and Competencies: Revisiting Interorganizational Dynamics in the Nascent Bionic Prosthetic Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why were incumbents able to pioneer and dominate the nascent bionic prosthetic industry, even though entrants represented the majority of the firms investing in this radical technology? To answer this question, our abductive study builds on the novel base principles definition and uses a historical approach to investigate the incubation and early commercialization periods (1974–2018) of bionic prosthetics. We use comprehensive quantitative data on all technological entrants and historical analysis of significant firms to reveal that organizational prehistory affects both the knowledge and intent of technological entrants. Start-ups, incumbents in conventional prosthetics, and established firms in other industries created and integrated subtechnologies into a radical system. Although all firms invested in component technologies, incumbents played a key role as system integrators. Incumbents dominated product commercialization; start-ups captured value through alliances or by being acquired, and established firms in other industries leveraged their knowledge in adjacent value chains as a function of their prior histories and intents. In comparing the virtues of our explanation—the creating radical systems effects—with widely accepted alternative explanations, we develop a more generalized framework of interorganizational dynamics in nascent industries as an endogenous, coevolutionary process that goes beyond explanations that privilege competitive dynamics to also include collaborative dynamics in value creation (and capture).Funding: This paper was funded by the Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets at the University of Maryland, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Strategic Research Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16915 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically impacted human decision‐making, productivity, and human agentic role delivery, thereby transforming HRM practices, particularly in recruitment and selection. Traditional recruitment and selection methods involve the dynamic interplay of structure and human agents. This interplay is changing with the emergence of human‐technology‐conjoined agencies that share task delivery and role performance responsibilities, thereby altering and creating new recruitment and selection routines. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 43 HR and talent acquisition leaders in a high‐growth emerging market context to understand the transformational role of discriminative and generative AI technology agencies in changing recruitment and selection practices. This study contributes to existing HRM literature by demonstrating the impact of discriminative and generative AI in recruitment and selection and the simultaneous human‐AI collaboration and algorithmic management of humans emerging as a consequence. Furthermore, we theorize the transformational changes in structures and processes across the entire recruitment and selection process emerging from conjoined agencies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the structure of ecosystems shapes firms’ acquisition choices. We develop a theoretical framework comprising three levels of ecosystem structure – local interdependence, clusters, and centrality – that could drive choices of M&amp;A targets based on expected ecosystem synergies, a previously undocumented acquisition synergy that creates benefits for the acquirer and the ecosystem overall. Ecosystem synergy is value created through combination of the acquirer and target's ecosystem positions that improves the combined firm's alignment with third‐party complementors. Such synergies manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of the firms’ components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. In the setting of the e‐commerce technology industry, our results show that firms acquire targets to increase local interdependence of their components and their presence in component clusters.Managerial SummaryInnovation ecosystems are critical for firms’ performance. While prior research has established the importance of ecosystems and firms’ positioning within ecosystems, we do not actually know whether and how ecosystem structure shapes firms’ acquisition choices. In this article, we show that M&amp;A targets are not chosen solely for the value created by the acquirer or target, but also for their broader ecosystem synergies. Ecosystem synergies are a previously undocumented acquisition synergy (distinct from internal synergies and market power) that manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of firms’ post‐acquisition components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. We test our theory by mapping the ecosystem structure of 6187 technological components that drives 186 acquisitions in the e‐commerce technology sector during the period 2013 to 2021.</content>

    <title>How Hybrid Work Shapes Communication Ties: The Role of Concern about Relationship Loss and Organizational Identification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid shift to hybrid work settings has raised concerns about decreased workplace interactions and communication ties. Based on Need‐to‐Belong Theory, this study extends previous research by adopting the concept of ‘concern about relationship loss’ to explore when and how hybrid work leads to the retention of work‐related communication ties. Our research, comprising a quasi‐experimental study and a pre‐registered replication, both conducted in the US, shows that hybrid work increases worries about the potential loss of work‐related relationships (‘concern about relationship loss’). This concern prompts employees to engage in proactive interpersonal and organizational citizenship behaviours (OCBs), but only when organizational identification is high. Notably, the impact of hybrid work and organizational identification is more pronounced for retaining existing communication ties than for losing or forming new ones. Our findings underscore the need to differentiate between concerns about relationship loss and actual isolation. They also emphasize the active role of employees in maintaining communication ties, highlighting the importance of organizational identification and OCBs. This study extends the conventional view of hybrid workers as passive towards a more dynamic understanding of how employees navigate work‐related communication challenges in hybrid work settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize optimal mutual fund risk-taking strategies in competitive multi-period tournaments among multiple players. With multiple competitors, every player begins by taking maximum risk. In the final period, all players continue to take maximum risk except the leading player, who employs a “lock-in” strategy that depends on the magnitude of the lead. Our theory predicts the leader should strategically lock in advantage by reducing risk-taking if and only if the lead is great enough, rather than an increase in risk-taking by the trailers to try to catch up. Empirical evidence from style-adjusted mutual fund tournaments provides strong and robust support.</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Management in Limbo: Task‐Driven Interweaving of Hierarchy and Market Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing use of algorithmic management (AM) in human resource (HR) activities has attracted growing attention from HR scholars, as organizations increasingly rely on digital labor platforms to leverage external workers. This study examines how these platforms apply AM in human resource management (HRM) and how these algorithmic systems embed both market and hierarchy management principles for shaping worker control and autonomy. Specifically, we seek to examine how AM manifests in two distinct ways across these platforms: one involving hierarchy and control, and another involving matching and autonomy. Using an inductive qualitative design, we analyzed 33 semi‐structured interviews with platform workers and documentary data from 23 digital labor platforms. Whereas prior research often frames AM in binary terms—that is, market/autonomy versus hierarchy/control—we explore how task characteristics influence the joint application of both market and hierarchy principles in AM for HRM activities of digital labor platforms. Our findings show how platforms dynamically calibrate market and hierarchy approaches to AM in response to task demands, balancing flexibility, oversight, discretion, and incentives. For HR scholars, this study highlights the flexible and conditional nature of AM systems that blend autonomy and control in nuanced ways. By moving beyond the dominant autonomy‐versus‐control dichotomy, we show how AM is configured to align with diverse forms of work across platforms, enhancing efficiency while sustaining worker engagement amid evolving task demands.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how a domestic venture capital (VC) firm’s syndication experience with reputable foreign VC firms improves its likelihood of achieving successful exits for entrepreneurial firms that it subsequently funds. We identify two complementary theoretical mechanisms: (a) domestic VC firms can gain certification from reputable foreign VC firms that improves access to superior investment opportunities and (b) they can learn from reputable foreign VC firms to better select and nurture ventures. Furthermore, the positive impact of syndication experience is particularly pronounced in facilitating exits for portfolio companies in foreign countries. Our findings highlight the enduring benefits that domestic VC firms gain from partnerships with reputable foreign VC firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users are recognized as a vital source of innovation and entrepreneurship, transitioning from passive consumers to active creators. This shift has significantly impacted the entrepreneurial landscape, prompting multidisciplinary research. Using bibliometric and thematic coding, our study critically analyzes 179 articles published over a 25-year period. Our review presents a theoretical analysis and an integrative conceptual framework comprising eight inductively generated topics nested within three clusters, representing distinctive motivations, processes, and outcomes of user entrepreneurship. Our study also maps the theoretical foundations that have shaped the field, highlighting both dominant perspectives and opportunities for further theoretical development. By clarifying the distinctiveness of user entrepreneurship, our review advances theoretical understanding and provides a structured agenda for future knowledge accumulation.</content>

    <title>Political Foundations of Racial Violence in the Post-Reconstruction South</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Election results act as powerful signals, shaping social behavior in ways that can be dramatic and even violent. This paper shows how racial violence in the post-Reconstruction U.S. South was tied to the local performance of the anti-Black Democratic Party in presidential elections. Using a regression discontinuity design based on close presidential vote shares, we find that Southern counties where Democrats lost the popular vote between 1880 and 1900 were nearly twice as likely to experience Black lynchings in the following four years. Despite no corresponding changes in local officeholding, these defeats were salient among local elites. We show that Southern newspapers, closely aligned with the Democratic Party, amplified narratives of Black criminality in the aftermath of Democratic losses. Such accusations were, in turn, frequently invoked by lynch mobs. These findings point to the strategic use of racial violence by Democratic elites, foreshadowing the institutionalized vote suppression of Jim Crow.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Customization and the Customer Journey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently offer customers the opportunity to customize in addition to buying ready-made products. Although prior research shows that customization can increase product evaluations, purchase intent, and willingness to pay, customers often do not opt into customization. Using a multi-method approach, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that the Customization Journey is dynamic rather than static: an initial customization experience has a lasting impact on the customer journey. Nine years of transaction data from a retailer shows that customers who customize at least one product are more likely to customize again with the retailer; they also spend more, visit more often, and buy more items. Next, we conduct a series of longitudinal experimental studies. By randomly assigning some participants to customize and others to choose among a matched set of products, we disentangle the effects of the customer’s inherent preference for customizing from their experience with customization. We find that an initial experience with customization significantly increases the subsequent likelihood of customization, leading to more favorable outcomes for both the customer and the retailer. Our findings suggest that customizers need not be “born”—they can be “created” via interventions designed to increase experience with customization, shaping the trajectories of customer journeys.</content>

    <title>Star Advantage: Employee Value Creation and Capture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into knowledge work is fundamentally reshaping employee performance and value creation in ways that challenge conventional wisdom. Rather than performance disparities being reduced through AI adoption, we argue that they may increase as star employees leverage superior domain expertise and strategic AI deployment to widen performance gaps—a phenomenon we term the “AI‐specific Matthew Effect.” These performance transformations coincide with dramatic shifts in value appropriation dynamics: Personal AI tools will enhance employee bargaining power by enabling portable, high‐value outputs independent of organizational resources, whereas enterprise AI systems serve as novel isolating mechanisms that strengthen firm value capture. These developments necessitate a theoretical reconceptualization of strategic human capital frameworks. Accordingly, we introduce the AI‐specific Matthew Effect to explain how AI may intensify performance stratification, modeling how AI reconfigures value creation and capture between employees and firms, and extending foundational human capital theories to account for human–AI complementarity. Our integrative theoretical framework offers critical guidance for navigating this transformation, helping organizations balance productivity gains with workforce equity in an uncertain era of interdependent human and artificial intelligence.</content>

    <title>Thriving at Work: A Synthesis of Human Resource Management Perspectives and a Future Research Agenda</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thriving at work is a psychological state defined by dual experiences of vitality and learning. Existing research suggests that HRM practices can play a pivotal role in fostering employee thriving. In this perspective paper, we review the current literature on the relationship between HRM practices and employee thriving through five broad conceptual frameworks: (1) high‐performance HRM systems, (2) development‐oriented HRM, (3) purposeful and responsible HRM, (4) relational and inclusive HRM, and (5) multilevel contextual HRM. Beyond this review, we propose four key avenues for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of how HRM practices contribute to employee thriving. These research directions seek to explore the underlying mechanisms, contexts, and conditions that influence the effectiveness of HRM practices in promoting thriving, with a particular focus on sustaining employee thriving over time. Through these insights, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how HRM can be strategically designed and implemented to support sustainable and regenerative thriving in dynamic work environments.</content>

    <title>The extent and drivers of internal agglomeration of U.S. multi‐unit firms</title>
    <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the extent and determinants of internal agglomeration—the spatial clustering of establishments within firms. It introduces a novel methodology that benchmarks a firm's spatial footprint against that of comparable stand‐alone firms, yielding a firm‐level measure of internal agglomeration. Applied across sectors of the U.S. economy, the approach reveals that internal agglomeration is widespread but varies by industry and firm characteristics. It is more prevalent in service, non‐tradable, and labor‐intensive industries, and is especially pronounced among diversified firms. Among potential drivers, labor similarity consistently predicts intra‐firm colocation, while input–output and knowledge linkages are less influential. These findings bring a spatial lens to corporate strategy, showing that when key resources—particularly labor—face geographic frictions, colocating related activities enhances opportunities for sharing and redeployment.Managerial SummaryMany firms are known to colocate or cluster with other firms in related industries to reap the benefits of sharing specialized inputs, labor, and knowledge. We study whether multi‐unit firms can generate similar benefits by colocating their establishments. We examine the geographic distribution of establishments of multi‐unit firms using comprehensive data on the U.S. economy. We find that over half of all firms colocate their establishments significantly more than would be expected if these belonged to independent firms. Firms are especially likely to colocate establishments with similar labor requirements, which suggests a deliberate strategy to leverage internal labor synergies. Our findings suggest that managers should consider the potential benefits of internal resource sharing when selecting locations, particularly to capitalize on synergies from resources that are less geographically mobile.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do banks fail? We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1863 through 2024 to study the history of failing banks in the United States. Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. These commonalities imply that bank failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Failures with runs were common before deposit insurance, but these failures are strongly related to weak fundamentals, casting doubt on the importance of non-fundamental runs. Furthermore, low recovery rates on failed banks’ assets suggest that most failed banks subject to runs were fundamentally insolvent, barring large value destruction of receiverships. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the primary cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates sample selection bias in early-stage investment. We use comprehensive administrative data on the universe of new firm starts in Norway, allowing us to compare venture-backed firms with ex ante similar firms that do not receive venture funding. The valuation premium for venture backing is sizeable at firm birth and doubles over the first 5 years, implying a substantial upward bias in venture capital (VC) returns relative to comparable firms. In contrast, the premium for firms receiving multiple rounds of outside equity emerges only after the first year and remains significantly smaller than the VC premium throughout the firm life cycle.</content>

    <title>Digital Development: Reimagining Research Beyond ICT4D</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions: digital in development (institutional use), digital for development (conscious design for outcomes), and development in a digital world (digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and why do producers change the categorization of their offerings? Prior categorization research assumes that producers engage in ongoing efforts to proactively optimize their categorical positioning, but this assumption may not hold for many producers due to their limited attentional capacity. Our theoretical account instead highlights the role of expectation violation cues—salient pieces of information indicating a violation of audience expectations—as triggers that can lead producers to revise their category choice. Our longitudinal study of 84,667 Airbnb hosts' categorization choices finds that negative customer reviews—an important form of expectation violation cue—significantly increase the likelihood of category‐switching, particularly in categories with heterogeneous expectations. Our study suggests that many producers might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.Managerial SummaryHow businesses categorize their products and services influences their commercial success; yet, there exists very limited understanding of when, why, and how businesses revise their category choices. Our study, which tracked the category choices of over 80,000 Airbnb hosts over time, reveals that Airbnb hosts most commonly switch categories after receiving negative customer reviews, particularly when a review indicates that the accommodation did not meet customer expectations and if the previously chosen category lacks a clearly defined set of expected features. When switching categories, hosts tend to choose categories that are relatively similar to their prior choices and that seem to accommodate a wide variety of offerings. These patterns suggest that many businesses might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces category interaction codes—knowledge regarding the expected interactions around entities in a given category—as a critical dimension of category strategy. Through historical analysis of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we demonstrate how these codes shape strategic categorization and competitive dynamics. We show that firms can exploit ambiguous interaction codes to access advantageous decision makers and organizational routines, circumventing entrenched competitors. Further, firms can institutionalize preferred interaction codes through product design, reshaping category prototypes and market dynamics. However, overcommitment to specific interaction codes creates competitive vulnerabilities when market conditions shift. By developing an “inhabited” view of categories that emphasizes socially embedded practices, this study reveals how market categories are enacted through interactions and offers new insights into category‐based competition.Managerial SummaryThis study introducescategory interaction codes—expectations about where, when, how and by whom products are evaluated, used, and purchased within a market. Using the case of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we show that companies can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging and reconfiguringcategory interaction codes. For example, Wang Laboratories sidestepped direct competition with IBM by categorizing its products for engineers and department managers rather than MIS executives, and outperformed IBM in word processing by innovating how actors interact with the new category. For managers, the key insight is that success depends not only on product features but also on how your product fits into the daily decisions, roles, and behaviors that define a category.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the influence of CEO characteristics on M&amp;A decisions has long spurred researchers’ interest, little attention has been devoted to the ramifications of CEO integrity—the adherence to generally accepted norms and standards. We investigate how CEO integrity influences different stages of the M&amp;A decision process. Specifically, we argue that while CEO integrity reduces self‐serving behavior, it may also become a golden cage that constrains CEOs’ latitude of action. Accordingly, we find that CEO integrity decreases the probability of Type I errors (errors of commission) but increases the probability of Type II errors (errors of omission) in M&amp;A decision‐making. We contribute to theory development by putting forward CEO integrity as an important personality construct for upper echelons research to build on and extend further.Managerial SummaryThis paper examines how CEO integrity influences M&amp;A decision‐making, providing key insights for corporate strategy. Analyzing data from S&amp;P 1500 firms (2006‐2021), we find that CEOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in frequent or large‐scale M&amp;As, particularly avoiding cross‐border deals due to higher uncertainty and potential risks. High‐integrity CEOs also tend to pay lower acquisition premiums and take longer to complete deals, reflecting a cautious and thorough approach. While CEO integrity helps protect firms from costly mistakes it may also lead to missed growth opportunities, indicating a trade‐off between stakeholder considerations and strategic risk‐taking. Boards may need to tailor governance frameworks to optimize the balance between the benefits and constraints of CEO integrity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the use of audit data analytic tests (ADA) becomes increasingly established in practice, auditors will often confront situations in which they inherit ADA developed by others, as opposed to developing the ADA themselves. Despite the potential benefits of ADA, inheriting ADA could decrease auditors’ skeptical actions by diminishing their psychological ownership of the ADA. In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA. Evidence from mediation analyses suggests that these effects are driven by decreased psychological ownership when auditors inherit the ADA.</content>

    <title>Listen Closely: Measuring Vocal Tone in Corporate Disclosures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the usefulness of machine learning approaches for measuring vocal tone in corporate disclosures. We document a substantial mismatch between the widely adopted actor‐based training data underlying these approaches and speech in corporate disclosures. We find that existing models achieve near‐perfect vocal tone classification within their training domain. However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance. Our findings emphasize the importance of a domain‐specific approach to voice analysis in accounting and finance.</content>

    <title>Rethinking Indigenous Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous Entrepreneurship has been conceptualized as arising from and reflecting cultural characteristics common to Indigenous people internationally, yet this approach increasingly fails to capture its diversity. Drawing on a database of 19,530 Indigenous enterprises in Australia, we show that criterial approaches to defining Indigenous Entrepreneurship based on preconceived ideas about Indigenous ways of doing business do not adequately characterize Indigenous entrepreneurial activity. We propose an approach that analyses Indigenous entrepreneurialism as a strategic response to the challenges and opportunities encountered by Indigenous entrepreneurs, shifting the focus of study fromexpressions of indigeneity in entrepreneurship, toentrepreneurial responses to Indigenous contexts.</content>
