    <title>EXPRESS: The Pick-the-Winner-Picker Heuristic: Preference for Categorically Correct Forecasts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People routinely make decisions based on predictions made by others (e.g., political pundits, market analysts), so it is in their best interest to identify high-quality forecasts. Experts characterize good forecasting as minimization of continuous error (i.e., predictions close to the eventual outcome). By contrast, the present work reveals that laypeople typically see good forecasts as those that correctly predict an event’s categorical outcome (e.g., the winning team). Using within-subjects, between-subjects, and incentive-compatible designs, fifteen studies demonstrate this “pick-the-winner-picker heuristic” as well as its psychological mechanism: People evaluate forecasts by assigning separate weights to (a) categorical correctness and (b) continuous error minimization, depending on the overall importance of the categorical and continuous dimensions for that situation. Thus, in the common case when the categorical dimension matters most (e.g., sports contests), people prize forecasts that accurately predicted the categorical outcome (e.g., the winner, not the margin of victory). However, when the categorical dimension’s stakes are experimentally reduced, an attenuation is observed. While this describes how people typically evaluate forecasts, crucially, a dimension’s importance is not necessarily related to its diagnosticity of forecaster skill or reliability. Accordingly, the pick-the-winner-picker heuristic may constitute a normative mistake, while framing manipulations help debias judgments.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Homing Alliances and Price Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OTT subscription video streaming industry has witnessed significant growth and heightened competition in recent years, marked by the influx of new players. At the same time, we are observing an interesting phenomenon where competing services are forming new alliances that facilitate consumer multi-homing. For instance, Amazon Prime Video has partnered with services, such as (HBO) MAX and Paramount+, to enhance the combined viewing experience for consumers through seamless integration. We build a game-theoretic model with horizontally differentiated services to examine how an alliance facilitating multi-homing between two competing services affects price competition in the market. We find that the alliance’s impact on price competition depends on the level of content differentiation in the market – competition intensifies when differentiation is high but relaxes when differentiation is low. The alliance benefits the partnering services as long as the differentiation is not too high, and interestingly, may increase the profitability of a third non-partnering service when differentiation is sufficiently low. We show that consumer surplus increases under the alliance, even if price competition is relaxed. We also investigate a focal service’s decision to partner with one of two competing services and show that it prefers partnering with a service that has high quality content but a smaller loyal base. Our research offers insights into the current landscape of the OTT video streaming market and provides implications for both managers and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An entrepreneur’s negative attitude toward debt (debt aversion) affects the financing decisions of the businesses they run. Controlling for a range of observable traits, firms run by highly debt-averse entrepreneurs are about 10 percentage points less likely to use debt. The same entrepreneurs are also almost 25% less likely to take up government-guaranteed debt during the COVID-19 crisis. These firms show less interest in COVID-19 support policies if they perceive them to involve debt based on experiments randomizing the framing and labeling of otherwise nearly identical hypothetical COVID-19 support policies as debt or grants.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.

    <title>Do Households React to Monetary Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how households understand and respond to monetary policy by exploiting the open auctions of early-stage crowdfunding and inferring individuals’ expectations based on their maximum requested interest rates. Using loan listings from Prosper, we find that borrowers adjust their willingness-to-pay interest rates in response to unexpected Federal funds rate changes, whereas anticipated shifts have negligible effects. These responses are more pronounced among high-income, high-credit-score borrowers; large loan applicants; and when Federal Reserve communication is transparent. The responses are highly asymmetric—Borrowers sharply lower rates during unexpected easing but resist increasing them during unexpected tightening. The results are robust to alternative specifications, including regression-discontinuity-in-time designs and alternative measures of monetary policy shock. Lenders also respond to policy shocks and counteract borrowers’ adjustments. Analysis of Robinhood data shows that retail investors mirror this behavior by reducing equity holdings after surprise rate hikes.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the general research fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong [Grant 17504925], the Dean’s Research Fund of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, The Education University of Hong Kong [Grant FLASS/DRF 04635], the Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology [Grant FRG-24-019-MSB], the Seed Funding Grant of EdUHK [Grant 02C11], and the Block Grant Blueprint of EdUHK [Grant 02A23].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04649 .</content>

    <title>Bridging the Divide: How Dual‐Background Leaders Unlock Returnee Innovation in Politically Connected Chinese Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how firm leadership diversity influences innovation, focusing on the interplay between returnee leaders – those with international experience – and politically connected leaders. While returnee leaders introduce globally derived innovation practices, their efforts often clash with the state‐aligned agendas of politically connected leaders. By integrating bridging mechanisms into upper echelons theory, we introduce dual‐background leaders – executives with both political and international experience – to bridge these divergent cognitive logics. Through a longitudinal analysis of Chinese publicly listed firms from 2006 to 2016, we find that the positive effect of returnee leaders on innovation performance is significantly weakened in firms with high political connectivity, especially in the absence of dual‐background leaders. Conversely, firms that effectively integrate dual‐background leaders are better positioned to reconcile competing innovation agendas and unlock the synergistic potential of leadership diversity.</content>

    <title>Should Human Capital Development Programs be Mandatory or Voluntary? Evidence from a Field Experiment on Mentorship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a field experiment, we find that a mandatory mentorship program raises worker productivity, whereas a voluntary version of the program does not. A significant reason why the mandatory program results in larger gains is that the lowest-productivity employees do not participate when the program is voluntary despite their having the greatest treatment benefits. A nationally representative survey of U.S. workers shows wide variation in human capital development program participation, suggesting that understanding self-selection is important for firms’ returns on these programs across a variety of settings. Our findings have implications for resource allocation, experimental design, productivity dispersion, and inequality.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07524 .</content>

    <title>How Middle Managers Affect Frontline Idea Generation: Evidence From Healthcare Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This multiple case study develops a mid‐range theory on how frontline idea generation is affected by the actions of an organization's middle management. The study draws from four acute‐care hospitals in Germany and involves 36 semi‐structured interviews with representatives from all hierarchy levels. We use mission statements from these hospitals to measure top management's strategic intent regarding frontline idea generation. Then we analyze the idea generation performance of 156 nurses from the hospitals and link it to specific middle management behaviors. The cross‐case analyses reveal that middle managers' shaping of nurses' innovation identity improves nurses' idea generation performance. However, this connection also means that middle managers' own forays into innovation can impede frontline idea generation. We find that middle managers' supportive behavior is largely independent of top management intent, a dynamic that offers both advantages and risks. These insights extend our knowledge about the role of middle managers in frontline idea generation.</content>

    <title>“Small Data”: Inference with Occasionally Observed States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the estimation of dynamic economic models for which some of the state variables are observed only occasionally by the econometrician—a common problem in many fields, ranging from marketing to finance to industrial organization. If those occasional state observations are serially correlated, the likelihood function of the model becomes a high-dimensional integral over a nonstandard domain. We generalize the recursive likelihood function integration procedure to incorporate the occasional observations, enabling likelihood-based inference in such estimation problems. In extensive Monte Carlo studies, we demonstrate the favorable properties of the proposed method for identifying all model parameters and compare it to alternative methods.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224].

    <title>EXPRESS: A Comparative Analysis of FLE Wellness Benefits and Customer Responsiveness: A Social Exchange Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the importance of frontline employees (FLEs) for organizations and consumers, it is important to motivate them to achieve optimal performance. One way to motivate FLEs is through employer-provided wellness benefits, which might increase FLEs’ responsiveness to customer needs. Building on social exchange theory, this research simultaneously examines five different wellness benefits to identify factors that can enhance FLEs’ feelings of being valued and an induced sense of indebtedness, which in turn can have downstream effects on customer responsiveness. The results of five studies, including a pilot study, preliminary sales study, field studies, and an internal meta-analysis, demonstrate how food and social benefits exert the strongest effects, with food yielding stronger direct effects on customer responsiveness and both showing indirect effects through value and indebtedness feelings. The next strongest effects are from mindfulness benefits. Physical and health wellness benefits exert the weakest downstream consequences. Importantly, if FLEs are in a supportive work environment, the effects of food and social benefits are enhanced. Conversely, job stressors and motivational constructs do not significantly impact the effects of employer-provided wellness benefits. By adopting the provided recommendations, retailers and service providers can institute effective and optimal wellness programs to enhance their FLEs’ customer-facing behaviors.</content>

    <title>Flexible Pay and Labor Supply: Evidence from Uber’s Instant Pay</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern tech platforms provide workers real-time control over when they work and, increasingly, flexible pay: the option to be paid immediately after work. We investigate the labor supply effects of pay flexibility and the implications of present-biased preferences among gig-economy workers. Using granular data from a nationwide randomized controlled trial at Uber, we estimate the effects of switching from a fixed weekly pay schedule to Instant Pay, a system that allows on-demand, within-day withdrawals. We find that flexible pay substantially increased drivers’ work time. Furthermore, consistent with present bias, the response is significantly higher when drivers are further away from the end of their counterfactual weekly pay cycle. We discuss welfare and broader implications in contexts in which workers have the ability to flexibly supply labor.This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05301 .</content>

    <title>Help or Hindrance? The Role of Familiarity in Product Development Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For products developed through a collaboration of specialized groups, success requires craft and engineering ingenuity from designers who focus on specific attributes, coupled with synchronized coordination between various design groups. Although shared work experience in the team—or familiarity—can improve coordination, it can deter creativity. We empirically study the impact of team familiarity on market performance of products by focusing on product development in the video game industry by coupling a granular database of development credits with sales data for video games. Although familiarity among coordinators has a positive effect on performance, familiarity among designers has a negative effect. Further, the positive (negative) effect of familiarity among coordinators (designers) is present even if familiarity is built through roles other than coordination (design). Overall, team familiarity is associated with a decrease in the product's market performance. Our results suggest that infusing fluidity in design roles and maintaining stability in coordination roles could improve the performance of new products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the social capital embedded in employees’ networks contributes to firm performance. Using novel, individual-level network data, we measure a firm’s social capital derived from employees’ connections with external stakeholders. Our directed network data allow for differentiating those connections that know the employee and those that the employee knows. Results show that firms with more employee social capital perform better; the positive effect stems primarily from employees being known by others. We provide causal evidence exploiting the enactment of a government regulation that imparted a negative shock to networking with specific sectors and provide evidence on the mechanisms.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of information technologies has intensified concerns about individual privacy and highlighted the importance of consumer privacy rights. At the same time, these technologies enable significant personalization of communications and offerings. We develop a theory of the effects of privacy based on the concavity of an individual’s derived payoff function with respect to market beliefs: When this function is concave, privacy is valuable. We identify market conditions that lead to concavity or convexity in the derived payoff function. The framework is applied to contexts such as product choice, price discrimination, data breaches, and health insurance.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: A.

    <title>Active Liquidity Management, Strategic Complementarities, and Market Price of Liquidity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how market uncertainty impacts the liquidity premium through a demand-side channel. I find that equity mutual funds actively increase the liquidity of their portfolios in response to increased redemptions during market stress. Liquidity preservation is more intense for funds more exposed to strategic complementarities. I show that a stock’s relative illiquidity within a fund’s portfolio is a key determinant in flow-induced rebalancing decisions, whereby funds follow a liquidation “pecking order.” This “flight-to-liquidity” is associated with increases in the liquidity premium and affects individual stocks’ reversal performance: Stocks held by more fragile funds and those with higher illiquidity ranks within funds’ portfolios experience greater returns to liquidity provision during market stress.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02095 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many online platforms like ride-sharing or grocery delivery, some demand agents can wait for a short period of time for a service if they are assured of its eventual provision within an acceptable delay. We study these “partially patient” agents in the context of an online resource allocation problem, contrasting them with impatient agents who require immediate service. We utilize a relaxed notion of competitive ratio, known as the resource/feature augmented competitive ratio, allowing online algorithms to benefit from additional features not available to the optimal offline algorithm. We introduce a class of polytope-based resource allocation (POLYRA) algorithms that achieve optimal or near-optimal competitive ratios by consulting specific polytopes and maintaining feasible algorithm states within these polytopes. For two or three types of agents, these algorithms can achieve the optimal competitive ratio. For more than three types, we present a near-optimal nested POLYRA algorithm that secures at least 80% of the optimal ratio. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical analysis, highlighting the efficiency of our algorithms beyond adversarial arrivals and the modified competitive ratio framework.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03335 .</content>

    <title>Displaying and Discounting Perishables: Impact on Retail Profits and Waste</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical studies have shown that consumers’ purchasing behavior depends on product display, that is, how products are organized on store shelves. We explore how a retailer selling a perishable product with deteriorating quality over time can optimize product display and the discounting of soon-to-expire units to maximize profit and reduce waste. Specifically, we consider a product with a finite shelf life that is replenished periodically. The retailer optimizes the product display setting, the discount rate and timing, as well as the order quantity in each replenishment cycle. We assume that the length of the replenishment cycle is such that, at most, two different product ages can coexist on the store shelves, and we refer to these two groups of products as the fresh batch and the old batch. We show that, when the store traffic is deterministic, only the following two policies can be optimal: (i) discarding unsold units at each replenishment epoch, so that there is only one product batch on the shelves at all times, or (ii) keeping and discounting unsold old batch units but making the fresh batch units more accessible to consumers. In contrast, when the store traffic is stochastic, all possible strategies can be optimal, as waste becomes unavoidable. In particular, the optimal strategy depends on the characteristics of the product, store, and consumers. Our numerical results indicate that, compared with a benchmark where units from the fresh and old batch are equally accessible and no discount is offered, optimizing the display and the discount results in an average increase in profit of 6.01% and a decrease in (relative) waste of 21.24%.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00316 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a financial statement (FS) fraud detection framework, called PeerMeta, that makes improvements in all three components of the detection procedure: label measurement, feature set, and detection model. For the label measurement, prior studies mainly adopt FS fraud events that have already been disclosed and confirmed. We construct a new measure based on news coverage that can reflect unrevealed FS fraud behaviors as well. For the feature set, we innovatively add peer factors learned through the business description texts in financial reports. For the detection model, two meta-learning algorithms are applied to aggregate the 19 popular classifiers. The results indicate that the proposed method has amazingly high recall of real fraud cases announced by regulatory authorities, reaching a staggering value of 0.982. We document that all components in PeerMeta contribute to the improvements of FS fraud detection and also showcase the significant economic value of the detection framework and find that recall is more crucial for the economic value than precision.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71991470, 7199471, 72121002, 72310107002] and the National Key R&amp;D Program of China [Grant 2021YFC3340703].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03604 .</content>

    <title>Product Ratings and Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we investigate how information about production externalities, such as ecolabels, can be presented to create market pressure on firms to reduce these externalities. Specifically, we explore whether integrating information on externalities with consumer product ratings into a single combined rating can generate pressure to reduce externalities from all consumers, not just environmentally conscious ones. Theoretically, we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium where producers invest in both high product quality and low production externalities. We show that under separate ratings, this equilibrium depends on a high proportion of “green” consumers, whereas a combined rating achieves similar results without such a requirement. More broadly, our model suggests that bundling ratings can compel producers to address niche concerns more effectively. We experimentally validate this prediction across two studies, confirming that bundling ratings significantly increases producer investment in additional attributes, such as reducing externalities, while maintaining the rating system’s ability to incentivize high product quality.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was financed by BI Norwegian Business School and the University of Bergen.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04684 .</content>

    <title>Individualism-Collectivism and Risk Perception Around the World</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding cultural differences in risk perception is critical in an increasingly uncertain world. Here we examine the relationship between the individualism-collectivism continuum and risk perception around the world using a data set from the Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll. The data set contains rich information of a representative sample of 150,000 participants from 142 countries, and investigates risk perception in terms of perceived likelihood and personal experiences for a range of risks in daily life. We observe that participants from countries with a more individualistic culture perceive lower risk after controlling their personal experiences. We observe similar but weaker patterns when we adopt an epidemiological approach to investigate the individualistic cultural influence of first- and second-generation immigrants and use historical kinship tightness to proxy for individualism. Our study sheds light on the importance of culture in shaping risk perception and contributes to understanding global differences in behavioral traits.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was supported by the Social Science Research Council (Singapore) [Grant MOE2022-SSRTG-029].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01612 .</content>
