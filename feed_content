    <title>On the Optimality of Affine Decision Rules in Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose conditions under which two-stage distributionally robust optimization problems are optimally solved in affine or K-adaptable affine decision rules. Contrary to previous work, our conditions do not impose any structure on the support of the uncertain parameters, and they ensure pointwise (as opposed to worst case) optimality of (K-adaptable) affine decision rules. The absence of support restrictions allows us to transfer nonlinearities from the problem description to the support via liftings, whereas the pointwise optimality implies that decision rules remain optimal for broad classes of distributionally robust optimization problems, including data-driven problems over [Formula: see text]-divergence or Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We demonstrate how our conditions can be met in two applications.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [Grant EP/W003317/1].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00053 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a portfolio-independent method to estimate q-theory models, in which parameters are obtained using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to match firm-level stock returns. Our methodology addresses a previous critique on prior studies that model parameters are chosen to fit a specific set of anomalies and different values are needed to fit each anomaly. By targeting the entire sample of firm-level returns and allowing industry and time variations in parameter values, our estimations yield higher correlations between realized and fundamental portfolio returns compared with prior literature. Additionally, the estimated two-capital model generates large and significant size, momentum, profitability, investment, and intangibles premiums, but falls short in explaining the value and accruals anomalies. This limitation underscores the importance of portfolio-independent parameter estimation in evaluating a model’s capability to generate return anomalies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S.

    <title>Marketplace Expansion Through Marquee Seller Adoption: Externalities and Reputation Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the race to establish themselves, many early-stage online marketplaces choose to accelerate their growth by adding marquee (established brand name) sellers. We study the implications of marquee seller entry on smaller, unbranded sellers in a marketplace when both unbranded sellers and marquee sellers can vary vertically across reputation (referred to as sellers’ quality). Although recent literature has shown that higher-quality unbranded sellers fare better than their lower-quality peers, we posit that this may not hold for entrants of any quality. To this end, we collaborate with an online business-to-business platform and exploit the entry of two marquee sellers of vastly differing quality. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework, we causally identify the effect. We find that, although higher-quality unbranded seller revenues increase relative to low-quality unbranded sellers when the entrant is of superior quality (consistent with the literature), the effect is reversed when the entrant is of inferior quality. Further, unbranded sellers change their supply quantities such that the platform’s average supply quality shifts in the direction of entrant quality. Using a stylized theoretical model, we identify two mechanisms that drive our findings: (i) new buyers brought in by the entrant disproportionately favor unbranded sellers who are quality neighbors to the entrant and (ii) the unbranded seller’s ability to adjust their supply quantities. Most notably, the choice of marquee sellers, examined through the lens of their externality on unbranded sellers, can foster or undermine the platform’s long-term growth objectives.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03606 .</content>

    <title>Robust Optimization with Decision-Dependent Information Discovery</title>
    <updated>2026-02-21T14:04:39+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust optimization (RO) is a popular paradigm for modeling and solving two- and multistage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. In many real-world applications, such as R&amp;D project selection, production planning, or preference elicitation for product or policy recommendations, the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an often costly investment. Yet, most of the literature on robust optimization assumes that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker’s actions. To fill this gap in the practicability of RO, we consider two- and multistage robust optimization problems in which part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method inspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies for each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each period, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters that were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a finite mixed-integer (resp. bilinear) program if none (resp. some) of the decision variables are real-valued. This finite program is solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach to the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of usability, optimality, and speed on synthetic instances of the Pandora box problem, the preference elicitation problem with real-valued recommendations, the best box problem, and the R&amp;D project portfolio optimization problem. Finally, we evaluate it on an instance of the active preference elicitation problem used to recommend kidney allocation policies to policy-makers at the United Network for Organ Sharing based on real data from the U.S. Kidney Allocation System.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported primarily by the Operations Engineering Program of the National Science Foundation under NSF Award No. 1763108.

    <title>Spaces for Creativity: Unconventional Workspaces and Divergent Thinking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies are adopting unconventional workspaces—often characterized by bright or oddly colored walls, unique light fixtures, unusual office furniture, vibrant artwork, the display of atypical non–work-related objects, and casual and playful atmospheres—to foster creativity. Yet empirical evidence on the causal effect of such unconventional workspaces on creativity has been lacking. Across four experiments involving a total sample of 1,133 participants, we tested the effect of unconventional workspaces on individuals’ divergent thinking: the process of generating many and distinct ideas to solve a given task. Contrary to our initial expectations, we found that unconventional workspaces did not always boost divergent thinking and even hindered it. Specifically, unconventional workspaces were harmful when solutions for a divergent task could be readily inspired by the workspace’s features because of cognitive anchoring. Hence, the positive effect of unconventional workspaces was significant only when the potential solutions for the divergent-thinking task were unrelated to features of the workspace. These findings provide important evidence of the causal effects of unconventional workspaces on the process of creativity and highlight crucial boundary conditions for such effects.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This research was supported by the Heinrich and Esther Baumann–Steiner Fund for Creativity and Business at INSEAD and the Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation, and Knowledge at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02052 .</content>

    <title>Discrete Choice via Sequential Search</title>
    <updated>2026-02-21T14:04:39+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Essentially every choice involves an information collection or search phase prior to a decision-making phase that culminates in a choice. To study the information collection phase within an important class of search problems and understand how it influences the final choice, we embed an analytically tractable discrete choice model in a classical model of sequential search with perfect recall. Although significant progress has been made in the theory literature in analyzing consumers’ discrete choice behavior using random utility models, discrete choice through a sequential search process has not received enough attention at least in part because of analytical intractability issues. We build on the seminal Pandora’s Problem as a model of sequential search with perfect recall and on Exponomial Choice as a model of discrete choice (with each choice specified by a deterministic or observable utility component minus a random or unobservable utility component following an exponential distribution). We derive the search path and final choice probabilities in closed form, develop all the analytical tools to optimize prices for a given assortment of products, and show that the optimal assortment must contain some number of highest-value products at optimal prices. These results enable joint optimization of assortment and prices efficiently. The structure of the solution features a distinct group of products that are priced just so they remain on the search path with higher probability. Through simulation studies, allowing us to control the ground truth, we also show that our model is competitive against the state of the art in empirical modeling of sequential search and that ignoring sequential search distorts both optimal variety and pricing decisions in an upward direction.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01552 .</content>

    <title>Credible Cheap-Talk Communication of Private Demand Information on Both the Forecast Average and Accuracy</title>
    <updated>2026-02-21T14:04:39+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A canonical setting in supply chain research is one in which a retailer sources a product, under a wholesale price contract, from a manufacturer that invests in capacity in advance of the retailer’s order. When the retailer possesses private information about demand, it is well understood that credible cheap-talk communication is not possible absent considerations of trust or the reactive setting of the wholesale price. This understanding is based on the practice of demand information being shared as a point forecast. Motivated by the fact that some firms are now sharing information on forecast uncertainty along with the mean, we revisit the canonical setting but allow the retailer to communicate its average demand and its forecast accuracy and allow the manufacturer to have multiple sources of capacity. We establish that credible and informative communication emerges in equilibrium under very general conditions. Moreover, when the manufacturer has multiple sources of capacity that differ in reservation and execution costs, the communication can be influential, strictly improve the manufacturer’s expected profit, and result in a Pareto improvement of supply chain profits. Our results suggest that both the forecast average and accuracy should be communicated in a supply chain not only because upstream firms benefit from a quantification of uncertainty but because communicating information about forecast accuracy (in addition to average demand) enhances the credibility of communication. We establish that improvements to the manufacturer’s capacity portfolio (e.g., expansion or cost reduction) can hurt the manufacturer because of an associated reduction in information revelation. This negative effect can occur if the improvement alters or impacts the resource that, in isolation, provides the highest optimal service level.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02726 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of Uncertainty About Future Accounting Standards on Financial Reporting Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial statement preparers frequently trade off the benefit of reporting biased estimates with potential penalties for misreporting. In making this trade-off, preparers often face uncertainty about potential changes to accounting standards (“standard-setting uncertainty”) that could affect the future benefits of biased reporting. Our experiment documents two novel behavioral effects of standard-setting uncertainty on preparers’ estimates. First, standard-setting uncertainty causes preparers to make less biased estimates, even though reduced bias conflicts with their financial incentives in our setting. Second, standard-setting uncertainty increases preparers’ sensitivity to measurement imprecision, which is important for high-quality financial reporting. Although standard-setting uncertainty is often criticized, our theory and results suggest that increased financial reporting quality can be an unanticipated benefit of the uncertainty that naturally arises from a measured and deliberative standard-setting process.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Research funding was provided by The University of Arizona, The University of Texas at Austin, and Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01469 .</content>

    <title>Price Informativeness and Corporate Investment: A Model of Costly Manipulation and Share Repurchases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize how managers can curb manipulation by signaling information via stock repurchases in an environment with costly short selling and feedback effects from trading to firms’ access to capital. Without repurchases, manipulation coexists with informed trading at low shorting costs, reducing price informativeness and firm investment. Manipulation becomes less profitable as shorting costs increase, making prices more informative and boosting investment if speculators are less informed. Incentives to manipulate cease to exist at moderate short selling costs, but making shorting more costly reduces price informativeness and firm investment. Our model shows how contracts that precommit funding and condition future investment on stock prices can induce managers to eliminate manipulation through stock repurchases, facilitating optimal investment policies. An important policy implication is that when stock repurchases are allowed and shorting costs are low, short selling bans will typically reduce investment efficiency.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.</content>

    <title>The Strategic Value of Data Sharing in Interdependent Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large, generalist, technology firms—so-called “big-tech” firms—powerful in their primary market, routinely enter secondary markets consisting of specialist firms. Naturally, one might expect a specialist firm to be fiercely protective of its data as a way to maintain its market position in the secondary market. Counter to this intuition, we demonstrate that a specialist firm willingly shares its market data with an intruding generalist. We do so by developing a model of cross-market competition in which the data collected via consumer usage in one market can improve product quality in another. We show that a specialist firm shares its data to strategically create codependence between the two firms, thereby softening competition and transforming the generalist firm from a traditional competitor into a coopetitor. For the generalist intruder, data from the specialist firm substitute for its own investments in product quality in the secondary market. As such, the act of sharing data makes the generalist a stakeholder in the data collected by the specialist, and consequently in the specialist’s continued success. Moreover, although the firms benefit from data sharing, consumers can be worse off from weakened price competition and lower investments in innovation. Our results have managerial and policy implications, notably on account of backlash against data collection and the market power of big-tech firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between the distribution of investor beliefs, the breadth of ownership, and expected returns in a model where stocks differ in the intensity of disagreement and in the extent to which beliefs are polarized, as measured by the number of optimists and pessimists relative to moderates. Polarization explains the size-dependent relationship between breadth and expected returns that we find empirically: positive for large stocks and negative for small stocks. We also find empirical support for the underlying mechanism: polarized stocks earn lower expected returns and are held more broadly if small and less broadly if large.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Comunidad de Madrid [Programa Excelencia para el Profesorado Universitario, Convenio con Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, V Plan Regional de Investigacion Cientifica e Innovacion Tecnologica], the LSE Paul Woolley Centre, and the Spanish National Research Council [Grant PID2019-111358GB-I00].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02027 .</content>

    <title>The Politics of Product Safety: Top Management Team Political Ideology and Serious Medical Product Recalls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing research exploring the influence of executives’ political ideologies on firm strategy, but little is known about how these ideologies influence product quality. Leveraging research that suggests liberal firm leaders prioritize customer safety, whereas conservative firm leaders emphasize firm financial returns, we theorize that a firm’s top management team’s (TMT’s) political ideology influences the number of serious medical product recalls that a firm initiates and how quickly the firm initiates them. Analyzing political donations recorded by the Federal Election Committee from top executives of 88 firms that had 4,072 serious medical product recalls from 2002 through 2015, we find that as firms’ TMTs are more liberal, they issue fewer recalls, but as firms’ TMTs are more conservative, they initiate recalls faster. Results suggest that firms with TMTs one standard deviation more liberal than the mean issue 1.10 fewer recalls per year, but take 22 days longer to initiate them. Findings from a post hoc analysis lend support to our theorizing, as we find that product quality-related adverse events act as a mechanism explaining the relationship between TMT political ideology and recalls. Firms with more liberal TMTs experience fewer product quality-related adverse events, and this reduction in adverse events acts as a mediator to partially explain the reduction in the number of recalls that more liberal firms initiate. Post hoc analyses provide support for an important firm implication; firms with more politically diverse TMTs have fewer recalls, similar to more liberal TMTs, and faster recalls, similar to more conservative TMTs.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03045 .</content>

    <title>Frequent Reporting and Short-Termism: An Experimental Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial market regulators have long debated the appropriate frequency of mandatory corporate financial disclosures. Whereas frequent disclosures may help deter overinvestment, they may also encourage short-termism. This paper reports an experiment that examines the effects of varying reporting frequencies on managerial investment decisions. Experimental results indicate that frequent reporting modestly induces short-termism, but it fails to reduce the overinvestment observed in the infrequent reporting regime. Nonbinding communication of intended investment plans does reduce overinvestment, but only in the infrequent reporting regime.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SES 1949112].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01955 .</content>

    <title>The Strength of Weak Commitments: A Theory of Price Preannouncements</title>
    <updated>2026-02-21T14:04:39+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manufacturers often preannounce reference prices for products that have not yet been produced or even developed. These prices are rarely binding, meaning that the manufacturers can make price adjustments in the future, possibly at a cost. In this paper, we argue that price preannouncements can serve as a weak price commitment that, we find, helps the manufacturers secure better deals from their suppliers, thereby lowering their procurement costs and improving their profit. Surprisingly, even an extremely weak price commitment can substantially improve a manufacturer’s profit. On the other hand, when the price commitment is credible enough, the manufacturer forgoes the price preannouncement. Collectively, these results underscore the strategic effects that price preannouncements can have on firms’ marketing decisions.This paper was accepted by Dmitry Kuksov, marketing.Funding: Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72422007] and the Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee [Grants 11502221 and 16501523] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02020 .</content>

    <title>The Performance Effects of Giving Front-Line Employees Direct Access to Performance Data and Thereby Limiting the Supervisor’s Feedback-Intermediation Role: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how giving front-line employees direct access to their performance data affects performance. To explore that impact, we conducted a field experiment at a service organization that made employees’ daily time-use analytics—previously available only to supervisors—simultaneously available to the employees themselves. We find, compared with the preintervention mean value, a significant treatment effect (an 11% decrease) in nonproductive time relative to the control group. That time, however, flows not strictly to productive (revenue-generating) activities but largely to the most convenient outlets, suggesting—as supported by our qualitative evidence—that data transparency on average shifted behavior more toward avoiding nonproductive activities than toward approaching productive activities. (As one participant observed, it led people to “conform, not excel.”) We examine three relational factors we believed, based on prior feedback research, could moderate the performance effect: perceived supervisor support, social comparison orientation, and work motivation type. Performance improvements are greater for employees who perceived their supervisors as less supportive and for those with low intrinsic motivation or high extrinsic motivation; we fail to find a moderating effect of social comparison orientation. Therefore, although we identify the avoidance (although not approach) value of transparent performance data, our results also tell a nuanced story about the supervisor’s optimal role in delivering feedback: The ability to shift people away from “bad” and toward other uses of time depends on the employee’s perception of supervisor quality and the employee’s motivation type.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, organizations.Funding: We are grateful to the Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School and the USC Marshall School of Business for funding this research.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02395 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information about the number of applicants to a job vacancy might simultaneously signal the degree of competition and vacancy quality. We study how this information affects job search. To do so, we conduct three experiments on a large online job platform in which the treatment varies what information is shown to job seekers. Information about the number of prior applicants to a vacancy increases the number of applications and redirects them to vacancies with few prior applications. Information about vacancy age increases application rates, especially to new vacancies. To further investigate the causal mechanisms, we conduct and analyze a survey choice experiment. We conclude that job seekers prefer to avoid competition rather than use the popularity of a vacancy as a signal of quality.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This research was facilitated through a research consulting agreement between A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a structural, nominal, life-cycle portfolio choice model with exogenous housing tenure and use shopping costs to generate money demand. Homeowners (renters) with negative (positive) net bond positions react differently to changing inflation risks. The correlation between real bond and real stock returns emerges as the strongest inflation risk quantitatively and generates large increases in stock market demand for homeowners in a 1970s counterfactual. Higher expected inflation encourages stock market participation but affects negatively poorer households without access to that adjustment. A more negative inflation-bond return correlation pushes homeowners more into the stock market, whereas poorer renters move into money.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02007 .</content>

    <title>How the Design of Ranking Systems and Ability Affect Physician Effort</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although relative performance feedback in the form of rankings appears to be effective in improving health outcomes, it may have either motivating or demotivating effects for individual physicians. Potential factors influencing such effects include a physician’s ability and the design of the ranking system itself; however, there is limited understanding of these factors. Using a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment with practicing and future physicians as subjects ([Formula: see text]), we systematically analyze effort within small teams under different ranking systems. Exogenously varying the number and position of the thresholds defining the ranking system, we observe that the addition of a threshold to create a new rank is motivating—that is, increases effort—only among individuals capable of exceeding that threshold; the effort of other individuals may remain unchanged or even decrease. In particular, a highly granular ranking system with ranks spanning the entire range of possible outcomes maximizes overall physician effort; high thresholds serve to motivate high-ability individuals, whereas moderate and low thresholds provide opportunities for improvement to lower-ability individuals who cannot reach the high thresholds. Our results suggest that, to motivate their teams effectively, clinical leaders should provide rank feedback using a system under which physicians of all ability types can improve their rank through increased effort.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by C-SEB Center for Social and Economic Behavior at the University of Cologne (Junior Startup Grant No: Rd04-2016-JSUG-Huesmann) and the School of Business and Economics at the University of Münster (Junior Researcher Promotion Fund).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the use of a prevalent but rarely studied form of intellectual property protection: trade secrecy. Building on existing survey evidence of firm-level, cross-sectional use of secrecy, we document the effect of stronger legal protections for trade secrets on the project-level use of such secrets. Our setting is the U.S. oil and gas hydraulic fracturing industry, from 2014 to 2018, in states where firms are required to disclose fracturing fluid ingredients to regulators except for substantiated claims of trade secrets. We examine how the enactment of the federal 2016 Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) affects well-level trade secret use across states with varying levels of pre-DTSA protection. We find substantial increases in the use and novelty of trade secrets. Further, wells with trade secret ingredients are, on average, more productive. However, the DTSA exerts limited additional effect on trade secret–related productivity. Supplementary tests address alternative explanations, show no evidence of intellectual property substitution, and provide additional support that we are capturing policy effects. Our results provide rare empirical evidence on actual trade secret use and enhance our understanding of how appropriability shapes use of trade secrets and associated inventive activity.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01138 .</content>

    <title>Reimbursement Policy and Drug Shortages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generic drug shortages have posed significant challenges to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and the government for two decades, causing severe consequences and drawing widespread attention. Substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying the causes, with some linking shortages to Medicare’s adoption of the average sales price (ASP) policy for hospital drug reimbursement. However, little research has captured the connections among reimbursement policies, shortages, and the influence of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which play a key role in representing hospitals to set prices with manufacturers. Recognizing that the reimbursement policy influences shortages through affecting supply chain parties’ decisions, we analyze a drug supply model that captures the essential elements and tradeoffs in drug wholesale price decisions. We find that under the ASP policy, the interplay of two opposing effects, the free-ride effect and the aligning effect, guides wholesale pricing decisions and affects shortage outcomes. We capture key factors influencing these effects and show that the ASP policy actually possesses resistance to shortages of drugs that have experienced shortages. Overcoming the challenges of limited data transparency, especially on GPOs, we further conduct numerical analysis incorporating various data sources (with the aid of machine learning) to gain additional insights. In addition to confirming ASP’s resistance to shortages, the numerical analysis quantitatively investigates the impact of policy and GPO-related parameters. We provide a thorough discussion of policy implications based on our theoretical and numerical findings. Notably, compared with the previously adopted fixed-price reimbursement policy, which we model as a benchmark in our analysis, ASP represents a market-data-driven policy. This distinction underscores the importance of a deep understanding of such policies for future policy evaluation and shortage mitigation.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02223 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy shocks that increase the costs of public goods should simultaneously reduce voter support for them. We study the extent to which this creates a corresponding voter-induced municipal credit risk. We exploit changes to state and local tax (SALT) deductions from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act as a policy shock to the costs of local public goods. In a difference-in-differences framework with repeated bond trades, we find that jurisdictions with a higher share of residents who ceased deducting SALT (and therefore, face a higher marginal cost of local public goods) experienced a significant increase in municipal bond yields, with an average treatment effect of 8.3 basis points or 3.0% of the unconditional average yield spread. This effect is concentrated in areas where residents have a direct impact on municipal financing decisions via ballot initiatives. This study thus demonstrates the importance of voters in the pricing of public debt and extends the discussion of political and policy uncertainty and therefore, coordination and agency problems to the municipal context.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06072 .</content>

    <title>Learning More Than You Can Know: Introductory Education Produces Overly Expansive Self-Assessments of Knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Education is a primary engine for gaining knowledge, yet it is unclear if introductory education helps learners gain meta-knowledge, that is, an accurate awareness of the scope and limits of their knowledge. We found that after taking an introductory finance class, relative to a control class, students overclaimed more knowledge they did not have, that is, endorsed more familiarity with bogus finance terms and expressed more confidence under incentives in their ability to answer questions about these terms. This finding was replicated in a Psychology and Law class, compared with a control class, with overclaiming still elevated two years later. In two follow-up experiments, participants in a hypothetical consulting context were randomly assigned to introductory training on GPS or a control topic. Participants in the GPS condition overclaimed more knowledge of bogus GPS terms and were more confident in their knowledge of real material never covered in the training, controlling for test performance. These effects were explained by introductory education both increasing self-perceived expertise in the education domain and creating basic schematic understanding that accommodates plausible but incorrect interpretations of unknown content. Introductory education, then, does not necessarily improve learners’ skills at identifying lack of knowledge. Rather, it can lead to an illusion of knowledge for unknown material, causing learners to overestimate their “circle of competence.”This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported in part by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, awarded to S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovation contests incentivize the participants’ to exert effort toward combining (recombining) their existing knowledge to create solutions. In the current work, we consider the case of serial contests, where effort to create solutions for earlier contests can also expand the participant’s knowledge, which can then be valuable in future contests. We develop a novel framework that explicitly includes the generation and utilization of knowledge by participants in knowledge-driven serial innovation contests, and we analyze the implications of this framework for optimal incentive design. Analysis of our model reveals that the efforts expended by participants in a contest can depend on future rewards, especially when learning emerges as a “side effect” of execution effort (i.e., learning while doing). In fact, participants will exert effort in an earlier contest even when its associated reward is zero. In contrast, when explicit knowledge generation effort is feasible (i.e., learning before doing), the contest designer should increase the reward for the earlier contest to prevent participants from postponing their learning. Our model demonstrates that whether one should assign higher reward to the earlier or later contest depends on the mode of learning, the participant pool’s ex ante knowledge, and the transferability of learning from one contest to the next.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03369 .</content>

    <title>The Asymmetric Effects of Posting an Online Review on Future Spending and the Dark Side of Solicitations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the prevalence of online review creation and solicitation, this paper examines whether posting an online review impacts the reviewer’s future spending on the reviewed brand. Identifying the causal effects of posting an online review is challenging because reviewers self-select into posting, making it an endogenous decision. I overcome this challenge by using randomized online review solicitations as an instrument for the endogenous treatment variable of posting an online review and establish that doing so decreases the average future spending by the reviewers on the reviewed brand. Additionally, I show that soliciting customers to post increases their propensity to write a review and thus in turn reduces their average future spending on the solicited brand. From a managerial standpoint, this finding suggests that online review solicitations can backfire, decreasing the average future spending by solicited customers. I therefore investigate whether the impact of posting (and hence soliciting) is heterogeneous with respect to customer satisfaction and loyalty. At the highest satisfaction level, posting does not change future spending regardless of customer loyalty. However, posting has a detrimental impact on future spending by dissatisfied reviewers. These adverse effects of posting emerge in the most loyal customers as soon as their satisfaction deviates from a perfect score (despite writing a positive review) and carry over to their future spending, even on nonreviewed brands of the company. Based on my findings, I present a set of guidelines for managers to follow when soliciting online reviews and responding to reviewers.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 grant [Grant C207MSS20B006].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01951 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk taking. This is known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion, indicating that MLA’s applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters [Gneezy U, Potters J (1997) An experiment on risk taking and evaluation periods. Quart. J. Econom. 112(2):631–645] to include five key adjustments. These involved downscaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results, which are highly robust to analytical heterogeneity, consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.This paper was accepted by John Beshears, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05720 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether investors’ personal experience with climate change affects their voting behavior on climate change–related proposals. We find that fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are significantly more likely to support climate proposals. We further show that the effect is persistent. We observe significant heterogeneity in the effect of hot temperatures, depending on firm-level climate risk, the quality of the proposals, fund investment strategy, and prior awareness of climate change. Fund managers’ personal experience with climate change matters for the outcome of climate proposals as it affects the aggregate support they receive. Fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are also more likely to divest from stocks with greater exposure to climate change.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: R.

    <title>Behind the Curtain of Workforce Diversity: Evidence from EEO-1 Reports</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the 2023 court-ordered Freedom of Information Act release of standardized Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) reports to examine the workforce diversity of federal contractors. Using the released data for a sample of more than 19,000 publicly traded and private firms, we provide descriptive evidence on the variation in gender and racial diversity of these companies’ workforce. We also document the existence of a racial gap between managers and lower-level employees. A substantial portion of that gap cannot be explained by industry or geographic factors, reflecting the influence of firm-level characteristics. Then, focusing on a sample of more than 800 publicly traded federal contractors, we find robust evidence that the racial managerial gap is associated with firms’ decision to withhold the voluntary disclosure of their EEO-1 forms. Although our findings are subject to several caveats, we provide important evidence on workforce diversity and highlight the importance of using granular, firm-level data to study diversity topics.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07432 .</content>

    <title>The Need for Speed: The Impact of Capital Constraints on Strategic Misconduct</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing literature suggests that firms engage in misconduct in response to financial pressure. However, the extent and severity of misconduct have been challenging to determine given the lack of granular data. This limitation is particularly true for smaller firms in emerging markets whose profitability and survival depend on misconduct. This study analyzes the impact of reducing capital constraints on misconduct using high-frequency global positioning system and financing data from the minibus taxi industry in South Africa. I find that lower interest rates, a proxy for lower capital constraints, decrease the most severe forms of misconduct measured by the propensity to speed and crash yet leave more modest forms of misconduct unchanged. Qualitative interviews and survey data suggest that these results are attributable to firms’ efforts to avoid default. These findings contribute to understanding misconduct as a firm strategy when facing financial pressure and suggest that lower capital constraints might improve firm survival and public safety.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01957 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many operations management problems, we need to make decisions sequentially to minimize the cost, satisfying certain constraints. One modeling approach to such problems is the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In this work, we develop a data-driven primal-dual algorithm to solve CMDPs. Our approach alternatively applies regularized policy iteration to improve the policy and subgradient ascent to maintain the constraints. Under mild regularity conditions, we show that the algorithm converges at rate [Formula: see text], where T is the number of iterations, for both the discounted and long-run average cost formulations. Our algorithm can be easily combined with advanced deep learning techniques to deal with complex large-scale problems with the additional benefit of straightforward convergence analysis. When the CMDP has a weakly coupled structure, our approach can further reduce the computational complexity through an embedded decomposition. We apply the algorithm to two operations management problems: multiclass queue scheduling and multiproduct inventory management. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm, when combined with appropriate value function approximations, generates policies that achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art heuristics.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: Y.

    <title>Integrated Fleet and Demand Control for On-Demand Meal Delivery Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show how integrated fleet and demand control can be effectively used to benefit all stakeholders in on-demand restaurant meal delivery. Fleet control—that is, the assignment of orders to couriers—is the main control mechanism to steer delivery operations. Another, mostly overlooked, control mechanism is demand control via display optimization—that is, the ordering of restaurants’ display positions on the meal delivery platform. Based on historical customer interactions with a meal delivery platform, we reveal that display positions have a major effect on customers’ restaurant choices. We then leverage this effect by proposing an integrated, scalable reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously optimizes fleet and demand control. We employ our solution method on simulations of large-scale on-demand meal delivery operations with endogenous customer behavior to derive managerial insights on the value of integrated fleet and demand control. Our results demonstrate that integrated fleet and demand control reduces delays experienced by customers, allows for more services per driver, decreases total travel time per driver, guarantees fresher meals, and provides equal opportunities for all participating restaurants. Our results further highlight that selling display positions may cause operational inflexibility and, therefore, may cause significant delays in the fulfillment process. Finally, we show that careful display optimization not only improves service quality, but also platform revenue.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) [Project 510629371] is gratefully acknowledged.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how collaborator loss affects the individual productivity of knowledge workers in corporate research and development (R&amp;D). Specifically, we argue that the effect of such loss depends on whether the lost collaborator was internal or external to the organization, which may have compensatory measures in place to maintain the continuity of R&amp;D efforts. To empirically investigate the effect of internal and external collaborator loss, we leverage 845 unexpected deaths of active inventors. We find a substantial negative effect on inventive productivity for the loss of external collaborators, particularly when the collaborator was of presumably high relevance to the remaining inventor. In contrast, the effect for the loss of internal collaborators is virtually zero. We show that the organization’s knowledge management and hiring capabilities are instrumental in explaining the muted effect of internal collaborator loss.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grant 329144242 and Collaborative Research Center TRR 190] and the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [Grants CEX2019-000915-S and RYC2022-038012-I].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03045 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field study of boards’ emerging responsibility to oversee cybersecurity risk, a setting in which few directors have expertise. We find that, although nonexpert directors may genuinely seek to provide diligent oversight, without expertise their efforts lack substance and therefore are mostly symbolic, even when they perform the same oversight activities as expert directors. We also explore why boards do not prioritize the appointment of cybersecurity experts and show that nonexpert directors do not perceive that their efforts are symbolic and insufficient. In contrast, expert directors perceive keenly the deficiency of their nonexpert counterparts and argue for the need for more cybersecurity experts on boards, and this viewpoint is shared by cybersecurity executives and consultants who support the board. Thus, we contribute to our understanding of when boards are likely to provide substantive versus symbolic oversight and inform the debate on the merits of board-level cybersecurity expertise.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by a Security, Privacy, &amp; Trust grant from the Pamplin College of Business and the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative of Virginia.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04147 .</content>

    <title>Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When launching a new product, historical sales data are often not available, leaving price as a crucial experimental instrument for sellers to gauge market response. When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk that, if not controlled, may lead to significant financial losses. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal effect estimation and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design, which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal effect estimation and tail risk control. Moreover, we establish an always-valid confidence sequence and a central limit theorem for the inference of the causal effect. Finally, we extend our results and the design to a misspecified setting, where the structural model is not necessarily linear but the seller still runs our design for linear structural models. The results demonstrate the robustness of our design and the wide existence of the relationships among the three objectives.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: The authors thank the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-IBM partnership in Artificial Intelligence and the MIT Data Science Laboratory for support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03209 .</content>

    <title>Disclosing Low Product Availability: An Online Platform’s Strategy for Mitigating Stockout Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring product availability and successful order fulfillment are critical priorities for any retail company. In this paper, we explore how sharing information about low-availability items (LAIs) can influence customer purchase decisions both in preventing stockouts and mitigating their negative effects. The net impact of sharing information on LAIs is difficult to predict ex ante because multiple effects may act in opposite directions. On the one hand, sharing information could discourage LAI purchases from customers who are averse to stockouts. On the other hand, such information might increase the demand for LAIs because of cognitive biases that make scarce items seem more appealing. In a field experiment with more than 840,000 Instacart customers, we first find that customers are 25% less likely to purchase LAIs when item availability information is disclosed. This effect is not uniform; it is more pronounced when customers shop at new stores, when they have previously encountered lower found rates on the platform, and when they have less experience using the platform. Importantly, LAI disclosure has a positive impact on the platform’s performance in both the short and long term. Specifically, this innovative and extremely low-cost policy results in a 5.8% increase in customer spending and a 5.7% increase in order frequency over the long term. Our analysis suggests that this positive effect is driven by several factors: the improved service quality experienced by customers, as evidenced by a 3.7% reduction in refunds, a 2.9% decrease in product replacements, and a 7.5% reduction in poor product replacement ratings when replacements do occur; increased customer exploration of different stores; and higher spending per order because of fewer refunds and the exploration of potentially more expensive product substitutes. In the context of online retail, a policy of disclosing LAIs can improve customer decision-making by providing stock information, reduce stockouts, enhance satisfaction by managing expectations and transparency, and promote exploration of more platform options.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01808 .</content>

    <title>Uncertain Search with Knowledge Transfer</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a sequential search over a group of similar alternatives. The individual value of an alternative contains two components: an observable utility and an idiosyncratic value. Observable utilities share an unknown population distribution, which captures the similarity across the alternatives and allows for knowledge transfer within the group. Once a decision maker encounters an alternative, its utility is revealed immediately, whereas the idiosyncratic value is unobservable and needs to be learned by sampling. The goal is to select an alternative with the highest individual value, accounting for the sampling and search costs. A novel feature of this problem is the combination of the individual and population levels of learning. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian dynamic program and characterize the optimal policy by a threshold structure. We show that it depends on the difference between the mean estimates of the current alternative and the population. It is optimal to continue sampling if the difference is between a threshold pair; otherwise, accept the current alternative if it exceeds the upper threshold, and switch to a new one if it is below the lower threshold. Other structural properties are also derived to shed light on the effects of the two levels of learning. A key insight is that more uncertainty is preferable at the individual level, but less uncertainty is preferable at the population level. Various practical variants of the problem are also considered.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: W. T.

    <title>Monitoring, Performance Reviews, and Retaliation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effects of retaliation on optimal contracts in a hierarchy consisting of a principal, a monitor, and an agent. With probability m, the monitor observes a signal about the agent’s effort and decides what to report to the principal. With probability [Formula: see text], the monitor only observes an uninformative default signal realization. The agent retaliates against the monitor and the principal whenever the monitor’s report reduces the agent’s payment from an endogenously determined default level. We show that the principal’s optimal contracting problem can be divided into two steps: First is an information acquisition stage. The principal chooses how much retaliation to tolerate, and more retaliation generates more informative signals (in the Blackwell sense) about the agent’s effort. Second, given the information acquired, the principal designs the optimal payment schemes, which pool moderately (potentially all) bad agent performances with the uninformative signal realization. The empirical literature documents that supervisors are reluctant to provide poor ratings and that performance reports are often inflated and compressed. We show that such a pattern in performance appraisals can arise as firms’ optimal responses to retaliation concerns.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01226 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The short-selling of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) creates “phantom” ETF shares, trading at market prices, with cash flow rights but no associated voting rights. Unlike regular ETF shares backed by underlying securities, which are voted as directed by the ETF sponsor, phantom ETF shares are typically hedged by the underlying basket as part of market-making activities and result in a significant number of sidelined votes of underlying securities. We find that increases in phantom shares for the corresponding underlying securities are associated with decreases in the number of proxy votes cast and increases in broker nonvotes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01567 .</content>

    <title>How Borrowers Respond to Dynamic Incentives? An Exploration of Repayment Decisions on Digital Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how borrowers in digital credit markets respond to dynamic incentives. To this end, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in progressive lending policies to identify causal effects on repayment behavior. Our empirical strategy uncovers systematic heterogeneity in borrower responses across different stages of the borrower–lender relationship. We find that first-time borrowers who receive exogenously larger initial loans are significantly more likely to default—consistent with elevated moral hazard and increased repayment burden effects. In contrast, repeat borrowers who receive larger loan increments relative to their prior borrowing cycle exhibit substantially lower default rates. These contrasting patterns are consistent with a theoretical framework where experienced borrowers interpret loan size increases as credible signals of future credit expansion, thereby reinforcing their incentive to maintain repayment discipline. Supporting this mechanism, we document robust evidence of strategic repayment behavior, particularly among borrowers who advance rapidly through successive loan cycles. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of relationship dynamics in shaping borrower behavior and underscore the importance of tailoring progressive lending policies to a borrower’s experience level in order to enhance repayment outcomes across a diverse client base.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02016 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity in the context of taxi drivers. The AI we study assists drivers with finding customers by suggesting routes along which the demand is predicted to be high. We find that AI improves drivers’ productivity by shortening the cruising time, and this gain is accrued only to low-skilled drivers, narrowing the productivity gap between high- and low-skilled drivers by 13.4%. This case study provides evidence that AI and skill are indeed substitutes, offering direct support for the underlying assumption of recent projection exercises regarding job displacement by AI.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [Grants 23K25495, 23H00828, 22H00847, 22H05009, and 22H00057], JST RISTEX [Grant JPMJRX18H3], and JST ERATO [Grant JPMJER2301].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01631 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider platform competition when platforms can (1) commercialize users’ data and in return offer their services for free (data-based business model); (2) protect users’ privacy and charge users for participation (subscription-based model); or (3) offer both options (the hybrid model). We find that competition does not always motivate the incumbent platform to protect users’ privacy. When network effects are intermediate, competition can motivate the incumbent to shift from the subscription-based model to the hybrid model, thereby increasing data commercialization. Yet, the opposite case occurs when network effects are weak. Moreover, allowing the incumbent to adopt the hybrid model is welfare enhancing when network effects are strong and welfare reducing (or neutral) otherwise.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Henry Crown Institute, the Eli Hurvitz Institute on Strategic Management, the NET Institute, and the Coller Foundation [Grant 0612017311].Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07744 .</content>

    <title>Last-Iterate Convergence in No-Regret Learning: Games with Reference Effects Under Logit Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work examines the behaviors of the online projected gradient ascent (OPGA) algorithm and its variant in a repeated oligopoly price competition under reference effects. In particular, we consider that multiple firms engage in a multiperiod price competition, where consecutive periods are linked by the reference price update and each firm has access only to its own first-order feedback. Consumers assess their willingness to pay by comparing the current price against the memory-based reference price, and their choices follow the multinomial logit (MNL) model. We use the notion of stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE), defined as the fixed point of the equilibrium pricing policy, to simultaneously capture the long-run equilibrium and stability. We first study the loss-neutral reference effects and show that if the firms employ the OPGA algorithm—adjusting the price using the first-order derivatives of their log-revenues—the price and reference price paths attain last-iterate convergence to the unique SNE, thereby guaranteeing the no-regret learning and market stability. Moreover, with appropriate step-sizes, we prove that this algorithm exhibits a convergence rate of [Formula: see text] in terms of the squared distance and achieves a constant dynamic regret. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, its convergence analysis is challenging due to the model lacking typical properties such as strong monotonicity and variational stability that are ordinarily used for the convergence analysis of online games. The inherent asymmetry nature of reference effects motivates the exploration beyond loss-neutrality. When loss-averse reference effects are introduced, we propose a variant of the original algorithm named the conservative-OPGA (C-OPGA) to handle the nonsmooth revenue functions and show that the price and reference price achieve last-iterate convergence to the set of SNEs with the rate of [Formula: see text]. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality and robustness of OPGA and C-OPGA by theoretically showing that these algorithms can also adapt to firm-differentiated step-sizes and inexact gradients.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of COVID-19 on market volatility in an equilibrium framework. The model combines beliefs-dependent preferences for economic dynamics and a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) model with unpredictable birth/vaccine events and mitigating policies for disease propagation. The estimated model explains the realized trajectories of the S&amp;P 500 volatility and number of new cases and identifies the source and composition of the volatility spike while providing a good match for 25 unconditional moments of economic series. Beliefs dependence, in conjunction with real effects due to the short-term decline of the effective workforce early in the pandemic, is critical for this comprehensive explanation of short- and long-run properties. A model comparison study is performed. Out-of-sample volatility prediction exercises document that the good in-sample model fit for volatility and cases is not due to over-parametrization. The effects of alternative mitigation policies such as changes in contamination rate, shelter-in-place duration, and shelter-in-place compliance rate are examined. They document the tradeoff in number of cases and stock volatility during the pandemic, and the dominant role of unemployment news volatility.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04352 .</content>

    <title>The Impact of Bank Financing on Borrowers’ Voluntary Disclosures and Real Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how an increase in bank lending affects firms’ investment disclosures and policies. Exploiting the unconventional liquidity injections by the European Central Bank in 2011–2012, we find that U.S. borrowers of European Union (EU) banks receive greater bank financing and issue more management capital expenditure (capex) forecasts following the liquidity injections. In contrast, we find no evidence of changes in bond financing or issuance of management earnings forecasts. We also find that EU banks’ U.S. borrowers on average receive negative market reactions to their capex forecasts and make no change in investment following the liquidity injection. Further, relative to firms with positive feedback, firms with negative feedback have a lower increase in investment but a higher increase in financial assets. Additionally, we find that the effect of increased bank lending on management capex forecasts is more pronounced among banks with weaker financial conditions and among borrowers with greater financial constraints, higher growth volatility, and more informed trading. These findings highlight the important role of capex forecasts in seeking market feedback following increased bank lending and suggest that market feedback helps explain why the transmission of bank credit to corporate investment did not occur following the liquidity injections.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00528 .</content>

    <title>Content Provision on UGC Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers visiting platforms that host user-generated content (UGC) not only consume content but also generate content by investing time and effort. This paper seeks to examine a UGC platform’s content provision strategy: how a UGC platform can motivate consumers to generate UGC and how it can manage the balance between UGC and the platform’s own content. As UGC and the platform’s own content perform the same function, one may be inclined to think that the two types of content are substitutes. Our analysis shows that they could function as strategic complements. This is because increasing the platform’s own content provision raises the quality of content on the platform, motivates more consumers to join the platform, and increases the total UGC provision on the platform. The public good characteristics of UGC could prompt us to think that UGC provision on the platform will be less than the socially optimal level. Our analysis identifies conditions when the total provision of UGC can be more than the social optimum. One may wonder whether it is profitable for a UGC platform to completely dispense with its own content. We find that it is always profitable for the UGC platform to offer some of its own content. This is because when consumers spend more time consuming the content, the platform can monetize their attention and earn higher ad revenue. Additionally, we find that an increase in ad space on the platform may motivate greater provision of UGC. Finally, we extend the model in several different directions and find that our results are robust.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: W.

    <title>Privacy and Polarization: An Inference-Based Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in behavioral targeting allow media firms to better monetize based on advertising. However, behavioral ad targeting requires consumer tracking, which has heightened privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. We examine how stricter privacy regulations that ban consumer tracking affect media firms’ content strategies and ideological positioning. We consider a model where media firms choose their ideological positioning and advertising, whereas ideologically heterogeneous consumers select their preferred content based on both their ideology and idiosyncratic taste shocks. We compare two salient informational environments: (1) behavioral ad targeting, where perfect inference about consumers is allowed, and (2) contextual ad targeting, where consumer tracking is banned due to privacy regulations, and media firms can only infer consumer types based on their media choice. We show that privacy regulations that ban behavioral ad targeting incentivize media firms to shift toward more extreme and polarizing positioning in order to draw better inferences about consumer types, even though the shift to more extreme ideological positions can hurt both demand and consumer welfare from content consumption. Compared with the monopoly case, competition increases firms’ inference motives and leads to more polarized content over a wider range of parameters due to an inferential complementarity effect arising from consumer self-selection. Our research uncovers a previously unexplored relationship between privacy and polarization, shedding light on the potential unintended consequences of privacy regulations in media markets.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the NET Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06054 .</content>

    <title>“I Hold On”: How Country Music Songwriters Cope With the Precarity of Craft Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We find that the key to coping with precarity lies in achieving supportive patterns of social embeddedness by investing in primary craft skills, advancing higher-order vocational skills, and navigating the core-periphery structure of the creative craft production system. As apprentice songwriters practice their craft and learn how to organize their songwriting routines, they become increasingly vested in the system. Once they become master songwriters, they broaden their networks by liaising more with other industry stakeholders and engage with the system more reflexively to ensure their continued relevance. Peripheral workers engage in allyship and develop ties with workers positioned at the system’s core. We incorporate these social strategies in a grounded theoretical model capturing how songwriters cope with precarity. We conjecture that elements of the model generalize theoretically towards other corporatized creative craft production systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An investor receives utility bursts from realizing gains and losses at the individual stock level and dynamically allocates his mental budget between risky and risk‐free assets at the trading account level. Using savings, he reduces his stockholdings and is more willing to realize losses. Using leverage, he increases his stockholdings beyond his mental budget and is more reluctant to realize losses. While leverage strengthens the disposition effect, introducing leverage constraints mitigates it. Our model predicts that investors with stocks in deep losses sell them either immediately or after stocks rebound a little.</content>

    <title>Scaling With Bias? The Role of Founders'
                    &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt;
                    Knowledge and Experience in Hiring and Managerial Appointments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job positions and appointing females to managerial positions. However, the founder's HR education mitigates these negative effects on both female hiring and managerial appointments, while the founder's HR experience only mitigates the negative effects on female hiring decisions. We also tease out the invoked mechanisms, conduct post hoc tests, and run an extensive number of robustness tests.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Supply Function Choice and Aggregate Supply</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)</content>

    <title>Take the Goods and Run: Contracting Frictions and Market Power in Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the efficiency of self-enforced relational agreements, a common solution to contracting frictions, when sellers have market power and contracts cannot be externally enforced. To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers——that is, same-day facilities——we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency. (JEL D82, D91, G51, I11, I18, L84)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess whether men and women are treated differently when presenting their economics research. We collected data across thousands of seminars, job market talks, and conference presentations, leveraging human judgment and audio-processing algorithms to measure the number, tone, and type of interruptions. Within a seminar series, women are interrupted more than men. This holds when controlling for characteristics of the presenter, paper, and audience. Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect. (JEL A11, C45, J16, J44)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show remote work led to large drops in lease revenues, occupancy, and market rents in the commercial office sector. We revalue New York City office buildings, taking into account both the cash flow and discount rate implications of these shocks, and find a 46 percent decline in long-run value. For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction. Higher-quality buildings were buffered against these trends due to a flight to quality, while lower-quality offices are at risk of becoming a stranded asset. These valuation changes have repercussions for financial stability and local public finances. (JEL E31, E32, G12, J22, M51, R33)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that subjective assessments of employee “potential” contribute to gender gaps in promotion and pay. Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women’s lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping. (JEL J16, J31, J71, L81, M12, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level. (JEL D12, D31, E12, E21, E32, E52, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of intensifying competition for contracts in the context of US Defense procurement. Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the effects of improving public transit infrastructure on city structure and welfare. It develops a quantitative urban model with multiple worker groups and transit modes, and derives a special case yielding sufficient statistics for aggregate welfare in a broad class of models. The paper estimates reduced-form elasticities to implement the approach using data spanning construction of the world’s largest Bus Rapid Transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains. Accounting for reallocation and general equilibrium effects, distributional impacts are modest. (JEL H76, L92, L98, O18, R42, R53)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly. (JEL F13, F14, G21, L22, L61, L62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Armed conflicts, terrorism, and political instability disrupt the implementation of thousands of prosocial projects in the developing world. In this unstable, fast-paced environment, managers may need to change course and adapt projects to new circumstances. Couldadaptive managementbe a solution? Leveraging a groundbreaking pilot run by the World Bank, we evaluate the performance of all 429 adaptive projects implemented between 1998 and 2013, when the Bank launched the “adaptable program loan.” Our study—covering 91 countries, 25 development sectors, and approximately $55 billion in funding resources—examines how armed conflict and adaptability influence project performance. We find that adaptability, reinforced by experience and learning, counteracts conflict’s negative effect on project performance. However, this moderating effect diminishes as project complexity increases and reverses in non-conflict areas as costs escalate and outcomes fall below expectations.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Substitution or Emergency Order? Averting O-Negative Blood Shortages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blood type substitution is an effective policy for improving the blood supply chain resilience in responding to shortages at hospitals. However, while compatibility of certain blood types provides an opportunity to better manage volatility in supply (donation) and demand (transfusion), in practice, it remains challenging to decide whether to use a compatible blood unit from the on-hand inventory (substitution) or to place an urgent or emergency order. Available evidence indicates that, in Australia, current practices for deciding on blood type substitution over emergency orders result in a significant imbalance in supply and demand for the most widely compatible units: O-negative blood units. This challenge is particularly critical in blood inventory management and represents a significant research opportunity for the operations management (OM) community. It can be addressed using state-of-the-art methodologies in data-driven decision making and perishable inventory under stochastic supply and demand. This study proposes a stochastic optimization model based on sample-average approximation (SAA) to aid the blood-type substitution decisions at hospitals. We take into account the historical demand data, the type and age of blood units in the inventory, as well as the shelf-life variability of the units arriving at hospitals. We compare the SAA results with several policies, including a single-period myopic model, no-substitution, over-order practice, and an empirical guideline. Results indicate that the proposed SAA model outperforms all the above policies. It thus creates significant opportunities for improvement in the management of blood units, as it reduces the imbalance in the supply and demand of O-negative blood units, allowing practitioners to benefit from substitution while avoiding the over-ordering of O-negative units.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Exploring the Divide between Retail Apps and Light Apps—Insights and Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of mobile commerce channels has fundamentally reshaped retail ecosystems, particularly in digital markets like China where smartphone adoption approaches saturation among internet users. While extant literature has extensively examined the impact of new channel introductions (e.g., online, offline, mobile) on firm performance, less attention has been paid to consumer behavioral nuances within established digital interfaces. Addressing this gap, our study pioneers a comparative analysis of purchasing dynamics across two dominant yet technologically distinct channels: native apps versus light-app channels (e.g., WeChat mini-programs). While both channels share core mobile attributes (e.g., small screen sizes, on-the-go accessibility), their divergent technological architectures (Swift, Kotlin, and Java vs. HTML, CSS, WXML, and WXSS) create systematically differentiated consumer experiences. Through econometric analysis of 185,437 transaction records from a multichannel B2C platform, we reveal that consumers tend to spend more, purchase more items, and exhibit a lower likelihood of product returns when shopping through the light-app channel compared to native apps. More importantly, these behavioral divergences are moderated by product categories, price levels, and discount depths. Our findings contribute to the multichannel retailing literature by providing new insights into consumers’ behavioral differences between the two popular, yet distinct, mobile channels. Based on these insights, we suggest that multichannel retailers should prioritize channel convenience and accessibility and reconsider their investments in mobile native apps. Additionally, retailers should tailor assortments, pricing, and discount strategies to each channel to effectively engage consumers and stimulate purchases. Our research also emphasizes the importance of aligning marketing, operations, and finance strategies in multichannel retailing.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Equity-Driven Workload Allocation for Crowdsourced Last-Mile Delivery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdshipping, a rapidly growing approach in Last-Mile Delivery (LMD), relies on independent crowdworkers to fulfill delivery orders. Building a sustainable network of crowdshippers is crucial for the long-term success of such systems, as participation is primarily driven by fair compensation. This is especially important for workers who rely on crowdwork as their main source of income, making equitable pay not just a matter of fairness but of financial well-being. In this study, we address several key questions that gig-economy platforms concerned with fair pay may ask: How can equity be measured? What are the associated cost implications? And how can potential drawbacks be managed? Our main contribution is the development of a practical, equity-oriented framework tailored to crowdshipping within an LMD environment. Inspired by the real-world operations of several crowdshipping platforms, the framework operates in real time and is built around a bi-objective optimization model that balances equity and cost. This allows us to systematically explore trade-offs and identify the equity measures that most effectively capture this balance. We demonstrate that even a modest reduction in cost efficiency (e.g., 2.5%) can lead to substantial improvements in equity; potentially up to 65%. Our results provide actionable insights for practitioners, including guidance on selecting appropriate equity measures. We also find that the best equity outcomes occur when the crowdshipper pool is kept relatively small. Furthermore, we quantify the performance loss of high- and low-performing crowdshippers as the pool size increases, offering valuable insights for workforce planning and management. Along similar lines, we demonstrate that our framework remains effective in managing vehicle shortages in dynamic environments while achieving comparable levels of equity improvement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Discrete to Continuum: Risk Preference Heterogeneity in Traffic EquilibriumHow do travelers with heterogeneous risk preferences choose routes in congested networks with uncertain travel times? Conventional models characterize risk preference heterogeneity using a small number of discrete user classes. In “Mean-Risk Traffic Assignment Under the Continuously Distributed Risk-Aversion Factor,” Xu, Li, Xie, Chen, and Liu develop a new traffic equilibrium framework that directly accommodates a continuous distribution of risk aversion. The resulting model generalizes the classical Wardrop equilibrium to settings with both stochastic travel times and continuous preference heterogeneity, providing a more refined representation of real-world routing behavior. This study demonstrates that the continuous approach outperforms the discrete approach by not only eliminating the inherent discretization bias—that can mislead infrastructure investment decisions—but also delivers superior computational performance, requiring less run time and memory. More broadly, the framework could be potentially applied to a wide range of biobjective congestion routing games where user preferences are continuously distributed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Operationalizing Semipersonalized PricingHow can modern firms leverage feature information to set prices in way that is both profitable and practical? A new study in Operations Research addresses this question by analyzing feature-based market segmentation and pricing (FBMSP), a semipersonalized approach to pricing where firms use customer characteristics to group buyers and set segment-specific prices. Although businesses often rely on heuristic “segment-then-price” methods, in their article the authors show that under realistic statistical assumptions, the jointly optimal segmentation and pricing policy can be computed efficiently. Further, using structural results about the optimal FBMSP, the authors prove that semipersonalized pricing quickly converges to the performance of fully personalized pricing, motivating its use in practice. Finally, in a case study on U.S. home mortgage data, they apply their method and show it significantly outperforms traditional heuristics, achieving near-maximal revenue with only a few segments. This research offers both practical tools and theoretical insights for firms navigating the balance between personalization and implementability in pricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the epistemic, interactional, and institutional foundations of contemporary organizations, yet management and organization studies are only beginning to theorise the implications of this shift. Existing research often treats “AI” as a singular construct, despite the fact that predictive, generative, agentic, and embodied systems rely on different logics and produce distinct organizational outcomes. This article interrogates the limits of this conceptual flattening and argues that cumulative theorising requires more precise specification of the technological systems under study. Drawing on developments across the field, we demonstrate how different modes of AI reshape core organizational constructs, including expertise, judgement, coordination, authority, and institutional adaptation. We advance a heuristic framework that differentiates among contemporary AI systems and clarifies their distinct affordances. The article concludes by outlining a research agenda that focusses on the shifting loci of agency, new decision architectures, and the normative and institutional challenges introduced by increasingly powerful AI systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Under Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, firms can sell private placement securities to the public via general solicitation (GS) or privately (non-GS). We find that equity offerings under GS tend to be riskier than under non-GS. After accounting for selection, GS issuers are less likely to succeed in i) raising capital, ii) getting venture capital (VC) funding, and iii) exiting via IPO or mergers and acquisitions, and incur substantial brokerage costs for advertising and verifying investor accreditation. However, GS appears to help new entrants and offerings that use registered brokers. The success of Form D financing improves future VC financing and exit outcomes.</content>

    <title>Analyzing Consumer Footprints on E-Commerce Platforms: A Multichannel Sequential Search Model with Reference Price</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Accompanied by the popularity of mini-programs, consumers can easily browse products across both the e-commerce native app channel and the mini-program channel, leaving behind extensive click-through and purchase records across various channels. These multichannel footprints contain rich information about consumers’ search preferences, which offer great potential for optimizing platforms’ multichannel management. However, prior studies predominantly focus on single-channel contexts, which may not directly apply to analyzing consumers’ multichannel footprints. This research develops a multichannel sequential search (MSS) model to characterize consumers’ multichannel footprints as a threefold search process consisting of cross-channel, cross-product, and cross-page search, where consumers dynamically update their cross-channel reference prices as they navigate their search journeys. The estimation results of the MSS model reveal that consumers exhibit significant heterogeneity in channel preferences, cross-channel costs, and sensitivity to cross-channel reference prices, contributing to their diverse multichannel footprints. Drawing on a comprehensive understanding of the MSS process, our optimal policy recommends that the platform implement a promotion gap with an average discount percentage of 32% between the app and mini-program channels. The channel-specific promotion strategy fosters a strong cross-channel reference price effect, which uses a smaller promotion to achieve a significant profit improvement over the state-of-the-art model.</content>

    <title>Conform or Workaround? A Multilevel Analysis of the Effect of Group Cultural Tightness on Enterprise System Use</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Enterprise systems (ESs) embed industrial best practices into adopting organizations through their system features, but employees frequently “work around” the system to get work done—sometimes in helpful ways, sometimes in risky ones. Our research shows that group cultural tightness (strongly enforced norms within a team) is a powerful lever for ES governance: tighter groups reliably increase conforming use while reducing both internal and external workarounds, and this pattern holds across Chinese and U.S. contexts and multiple organizational settings. Importantly, not all workarounds are equal. Evidence from multisourced, longitudinal field data indicates that conforming use and internal workarounds can improve job performance, whereas external workarounds harm performance—likely by creating fragmented processes, data gaps, and compliance and security exposure. For practice and policy, the message is clear: organizations should strengthen team-level norms and accountability to curb harmful “outside-the-system” behaviors, while simultaneously creating safe, sanctioned channels to surface, evaluate, and integrate beneficial internal workarounds (e.g., controlled extensions, approved templates, and rapid governance reviews). This balanced approach supports performance, compliance, and continuous improvement without shutting down frontline problem-solving.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research has produced mixed evidence on the success of green crowdfunding campaigns. We investigate whether country-level environmental institutions help explain these inconsistencies by moderating backers’ responses. While such institutions may enhance campaign legitimacy, they can also reduce the perceived urgency to contribute by offering alternative support channels. Analyzing a large Kickstarter dataset with machine learning, we find that green campaigns are less likely to succeed, particularly in countries with stronger environmental institutions. Post-hoc analyses point to a crowding-out effect of institutional support, which dampens individual backing, and suggest that omitted variable bias may partly account for prior conflicting results.</content>

    <title>Mapping the landscape of research findings: Generalization across contexts in strategic management research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge accumulation requires that we understand whether and when relationships identified in any research setting generalize to others—that is, suggesting domains where results hold (or not). Strategy scholars carefully identify how theoretical mechanisms operate in their chosen research contexts, but attend less to whether their findings apply in other contexts. Accordingly, we recommend reframing empirical contexts, typically described in terms ofnominalcategories (e.g., industries, countries, or time periods), by highlightingcontextual attributesof the nominal settings (e.g., industry concentration or technological modularity), which in turn reflect more abstractconceptualcategories (e.g., uncertainty, interdependence, and variance) across potential research contexts. This approach can help integrate prior findings and suggest future study contexts to better enhance our understanding of the research landscape.Managerial SummaryAcademic research in strategic management tends to derive findings in very specific nominal settings—particular industries, years, and regions. Since strategy practitioners operate across a wide variety of industries and regions, they need to assess whether available research findings are applicable in their own settings. We suggest that understanding whether and when research findings apply to unstudied settings can be facilitated by categorizing research settings using more abstract conceptual constructs (such as environment uncertainty, variance across firms, or interdependence between firms), rather than by the traditional emphasis on nominal settings. We discuss a variety of research setting attributes (such as industry concentration and technological modularity) that can aid the translation of extant research findings to settings where practitioners are operating.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a system of disaggregated economic accounts. The system breaks down national accounting positions into bilateral flows between consistently defined groups of consumers (“consumer cells”), groups of producers (“producer cells”), the government, and the rest of the world. We disaggregate the full circular flow of money, including consumer spending, labor compensation, firm profits, trade in intermediates, foreign trade, and government transactions, while satisfying all national accounting identities. We implement the disaggregated system for small region-by-industry cells in Denmark and present stylized facts, including variation in domestic spending shares, local and urban bias in consumer spending, and a pattern of “triangular flows” across regions. Cell-level measures of “spending intensity” capture how much spending by a cell contributes to the income of cells experiencing unemployment after a shock. Using a general equilibrium model, we show that fiscal transfers are more effective in stimulating aggregate GDP when they target cells with high spending intensity on unemployed cells. Knowledge of the disaggregated economic accounts helps governments select more effective policies.</content>

One of their major results is that the venture is funded with positive probability in all trembling-hand perfect Nash equilibria.

    <title>Is Multicloud the Future? Desirability of Compatibility in Cloud Computing Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leading online service providers, as major customers of cloud computing services, are increasingly adopting a multicloud strategy to enhance service delivery across different locations. However, compatibility issues among various cloud platforms complicate the implementation of this strategy. To address this challenge, cloud providers can offer a multicloud management platform that acts as a bridge between distinct cloud environments. Although such a platform can enhance customers’ multicloud experience, it also entails additional costs for the cloud providers. Our paper examines cloud providers’ compatibility decisions and the impact of compatibility on competing cloud providers and their customers. Our findings reveal that, when compatibility is established in equilibrium, cloud providers consistently set higher prices for their resources than when compatibility is absent. Additionally, we find that a cloud provider with greater market dominance always attracts more demand, whereas the rival with smaller market dominance may experience a demand decrease. Interestingly, when a cloud provider establishes compatibility in equilibrium, the competitor’s profit always increases, although customer welfare can decline under compatibility. These insights, along with other findings presented in the paper, can support cloud providers in deciding when to establish compatibility and how to price their resources effectively. Furthermore, we provide guidelines for policymakers on when compatibility could enhance customer welfare, supporting effective implementation of compatibility strategies.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although employee diversity can contribute to team creativity, extant research has shown that, when diverse employees form strong demographic faultlines, subgroup identity separation and intensified relationship conflicts may be harmful to team creativity. Therefore, effective remedies in managing relationships and bridging identities between subgroups are urgently needed in these teams. Building on brokering research, we introduce team iungens practice (TIP) – so named from a Latin phrase meaning ‘joins or unites’ – as a new team process that team members or leaders can engage to forge and strengthen connections or facilitate new coordination among team members. We propose that teams can effectively utilize this behavioural strategy to bridge structural (faultline) and process (conflict) divides rooted in subgroup identity separation, thereby mitigating their negative impacts on team creativity. In Study 1, we developed and validated a scale to measure TIP. In Study 2, we found that TIPs effectively mitigated the positive effect of demographic faultline strength on relationship conflict and attenuated the negative impact of relationship conflict on team creativity from a multisource and multistage survey study. We demonstrate the value of TIPs as a behavioural strategy for managing demographic faultlines and relationship conflicts in teams.</content>

    <title>Privacy trade-offs in international markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even as data privacy regulations expand globally, their strategic implications for international business remain underexplored. Prior research mostly treats data privacy regulation as a compliance issue, overlooking how firms strategically manage cross-border variations and respond to stakeholder pressures. Drawing on institutional economics and stakeholder theory, this article conceptualizes two trade-offs generated by data privacy regulations: (1) a regulatory, cost–benefit trade-off between privacy compliance costs and customer privacy empowerment and (2) a firm performance, temporal trade-off in which early compliance costs undermine short-term outcomes, before longer-term, trust-based benefits emerge. An international event study of ten regulations across 24 countries affirms that data privacy regulations impose short-term financial setbacks but generate long-term gains. These effects vary across contexts: At regulation, industry, and firm levels, conditions in which internal pressures to minimize risk dominate (intense privacy regulation, strong data dependence, limited resources) intensify early losses. At national levels, environments dominated by external pressures for credible compliance (high formal and informal institutional effectiveness) offset short-term losses and magnify long-term benefits. For international business theory, this study reframes data privacy regulation as a strategic opportunity and highlights how internal versus external legitimacy pressures shape trade-offs that firms must balance to navigate cross-border compliance demands.</content>

    <title>Financial Climate‐Risk Measurement, Impact Funds, and Green Transitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulators are contemplating or mandating precise measurement of financial climate‐risk exposure to promote sustainable investments. We show that such mandates can be counterproductive in the presence of social funds that catalyze change by subsidizing the adoption of cleaner production technologies. Firms can exploit a social fund's impact motive by measuring their climate‐risk exposure imprecisely. This strategic imprecision prevents the fund from distinguishing between firms that require subsidies and those that would switch to clean technologies for financial reasons alone, thereby increasing the ex ante subsidies firms can extract. A by‐product of this rent‐seeking behavior is that firms adopt clean technologies more frequently than would be jointly efficient under precise measurement. Our analysis suggests that the regulatory push for precise climate‐risk measurement can reduce social funds' impact and the frequency of green transitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how the COVID‐19 pandemic, as a disruptive external shock, has reshaped organizational practices, with particular emphasis on changes in work design and compensation strategies. Drawing on a unique dataset of over 1.8 million online job postings from Chinese publicly listed firms, we employed a large language model to systematically quantify work design characteristics. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach, we found that the pandemic significantly enhanced skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback, and work‐from‐home feasibility. Notably, these effects varied by occupational nonroutineness: occupations with high nonroutineness exhibited larger increases in task significance but smaller increases in other work design characteristics. Moreover, work design characteristics mediated the relationship between the pandemic and salaries, though these indirect effects were attenuated for nonroutine occupations. Additionally, we observed post‐pandemic adjustments in firms' compensation, including notable declines in performance‐related pay and insurance benefits, accompanied by increases in subsidies. These findings provide new insights into how organizations redesign work and adjust compensation strategies in response to large‐scale external shocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) is inherently complex. It involves systems of principles, practices, and activities operating at individual, group, organizational, and macro levels, which are interlinked through complex processes. Yet, empirical research has not kept pace with this conceptual richness. We hope to inspire HRM scholars to address complexity. We draw on theoretical frameworks that explicitly conceptualizesystems as systems,processes as processesandsystems as processescomplemented by empirical examples (mainly from adjacent fields) to illustrate how these modes of thinking have helped solve complex problems and how this could be applied to HRM. Embracing complexity in HRM is not about making research harder for its own sake but about seeing the field as it truly is dynamic, interconnected, and evolving. We need to shift our attention from isolated variables toward patterns, processes, and interdependencies across time. This requires richer data, deeper collaboration, and methodological boldness, and opens new possibilities for understanding the patterns and dynamics that shape people and organizations. Complexity in HRM invites us to see connections rather than fragments, to uncover the dynamics beneath the surface, and to design insights that matter. Perhaps the future of HRM research lies not in simplifying complexity, but in embracing it.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of conflict-induced displacement on human capital and occupational shifts, focusing on the Mozambican civil war (1977 - 1992), during which millions of civilians were forced to flee to the countryside, cities, and neighboring countries. Reconstructing the wartime mobility histories of the surviving population, we examine the consequences of multiple displacement trajectories within a unified framework. First, we characterize the education and sectoral employment of the universe of (non-)displaced. Second, we exploit differences in relocation trajectories among extended kin members during their schooling years. Displacement is associated with significant gains in education. Third, employing a “movers design,” we show that minors displaced earlier to better districts experienced an increase in educational attainment. Focusing on moves during the intensification of the war and when comparing members of the same household, regional childhood exposure effects remain strong, whereas spatial sorting becomes negligible. Fourth, we jointly estimate place-based, spatial sorting, and uprootedness effects, showing that all forces are at play. Fifth, a small survey in Mozambique’s largest northern city reveals long-term effects: internally displaced report higher education than their siblings who stayed behind, but lower social capital and worse mental health relative to locals. Our findings demonstrate that displacement shocks can foster human capital accumulation, even in very low-income settings, albeit at the cost of enduring social and psychological traumas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Labeling to Detect Hidden Human Trafficking RisksHuman trafficking investigators face the immense challenge of sifting through vast amounts of online data to uncover illicit activities. In their article, Reducing Manual Labeling Effort in Imbalanced Data Sets: Active Learning for Detecting Illicit Massage Business Reviews, Tobey, Mayorga, Bosisto, and Özaltın present a novel framework that uses reinforcement learning–based active learning to reduce the burden of manual data labeling, improving detection of illicit massage business reviews on Yelp. By strategically selecting the most informative reviews for expert annotation, the approach achieves strong performance despite limited and imbalanced data sets, easing the emotional and time costs of reviewing disturbing content. The study demonstrates that their method outperforms benchmark active learning strategies, remains effective even with large query batches, and generalizes across regions. Beyond combating human trafficking, the framework offers a scalable solution for other domains with scarce, sensitive, or costly-to-label data.</content>

    <title>Online Demand Fulfillment Problem with Initial Inventory Placement: A Regret Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studying How Inventory Placement Shapes Online Fulfillment PerformanceA growing share of e-commerce operations involves deciding not only how to fulfill incoming orders, but also where to position inventory beforehand. In “Online Demand Fulfillment Problem with Initial Inventory Placement: A Regret Analysis,” Arlotto, Keskin, and Wei examine how these two decisions interact. The authors introduce a joint regret framework that evaluates the performance of a fulfillment policy together with the initial allocation of inventory across warehouses. Their analysis shows that probabilistic fulfillment inevitably accumulates regret that grows with the length of the planning horizon, regardless of how inventory is initially placed. By contrast, when combined with an appropriate offline inventory placement, the score-based approach achieves a regret bound that remains stable over time and scales only with the size of the system. The study offers insight into the role of initial placement in shaping fulfillment policy performance.</content>

    <title>Tail-Driven Nonparametric Estimation for State Price Densities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes and implements a novel nonparametric method for estimating the state price density (SPD) over the entire state space, including the tails. This SPD estimator achieves shape consistency properties in theory, particularly at the tails. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method. In particular, our estimator accurately captures the risk-neutral tail distribution, which is often underestimated by existing alternative methods. In an empirical analysis based on Standard and Poor’s 500 options data, we evaluate the out-of-sample performance of our SPD estimation method and demonstrate that the estimates can serve as effective indicators for market conditions and exhibit predictive power for asset returns. Combining these perspectives, we suggest that our SPD estimator renders a valuable tool for risk management and asset pricing.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: The research of C.

    <title>Expectations Matter: When (Not) to Use Machine Learning Earnings Forecasts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We comprehensively examine the usefulness of machine learning technology to predict a firm’s earnings and offer three main findings. First, although prior literature suggests machine learning can offer better earnings forecasts than analysts, we show that this result is highly sensitive to machine learning model specification choices (i.e., 80% of evaluated machine forecasts fail to beat analysts). Second, we examine why the most accurate machine learning forecast consistently beats analysts, finding that they correct for predictable analyst biases that are both linear and nonlinear and largely relate to analysts’ prior forecast errors, forecasted earnings levels, and the firm’s stock price. Finally, we find that investors’ earnings expectations, as revealed through stock prices, largely—but do not fully—correct for these predictable analyst biases, with delayed price realization up to nine months. In additional analysis, we find that optimal machine learning specification choices remain stable over time and that, although the machine’s outperformance narrows in recent periods, it remains substantial among small-cap stocks. Overall, our study moves beyond the question of whether machine forecasts are superior to human forecasts and instead focuses on which machine forecast specifications matter, as well as when and why machine forecasts are most superior. In so doing, we provide code and estimates for the most accurate machine forecast specification and demonstrate that investors’ expectations appear to largely (but not fully) align with them.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05808 .</content>

    <title>Supply Chain Guardianship: Why Some Firms Intervene When Other Firms Commit Fraud</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In supply chains, firms often become aware of illegal actions committed by their partners, prompting the critical question: when and why do those who know become those who act? Drawing on industry examples of supply chain fraud, we introduce the concept of supply chain guardianship to study how firms respond to potential fraud committed by their supply chain partners. We identify key influences on supply chain guardianship and refine these insights into hypotheses, which we test across four behavioral experiments (n= 1000). Study A finds that the tone at the top of an organization can promote supply chain guardianship and that state moral disengagement is negatively correlated with it. Study B manipulates process moral disengagement and finds that it reduces guardianship behavior. Although the network position of the supply chain guardian emerges as important in industry examples, we do not find a significant effect in the experiments. We replicate and validate these findings in Studies C and D. This study offers an initial foundation for a behavioral theory of interfirm fraud responses in supply chains and offers practical insights into how firms can increase supply chain guardianship across macro‐, meso‐, and microlevels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Secondary stakeholder demands represent increasingly important strategic issues for firms. However, the principal drivers of firm response remain poorly understood. We extend research on firm responsiveness to secondary stakeholders by introducing a new theoretical perspective to detail the cognitive processes through which key CEO attributes—namely, personal values and passion—shape the trajectories of firm responsiveness. We first outline key aspects of secondary stakeholder demands to explain why CEO values and passion are important determinants of a firm’s response to secondary stakeholder demands. We then explain how a CEO’s values and passion influence the process of firm responsiveness. Finally, we extend our arguments to illustrate how values and passion-infused responses may influence social (dis)approval among key organizational stakeholders. By focusing on the cognitive processes of CEOs, we offer novel theoretical contributions to stakeholder theory, strategic leadership research, and the literature on firm social evaluations.</content>

    <title>How Do Different Remote Work Arrangements Impact Employee Job Satisfaction and Retention?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how working remotely impacts employee job satisfaction and retention using unique data on the remote work arrangements of nearly 165,000 employees. Our findings show that the positive association between working remotely more frequently and job satisfaction diminishes substantially after controlling for employee compensation, occupation, demographics, and workplace characteristics (e.g., feeling appreciated at work). Moreover, remote work is associated with a higher intention to leave the firm after considering these other factors. This suggests that workplace characteristics beyond remote work have a more consequential association with job satisfaction and retention than remote work itself. Using variation in job tasks and worker–manager relationships, we find that working remotely more frequently confers higher job satisfaction for employees in low-coordination roles or those who perceive their direct supervisors unfavorably. The findings suggest that remote work plays a more limited role in shaping job satisfaction and retention relative to broader workplace characteristics, and that its value depends on how well work arrangements are matched to employees’ strengths, coordination requirements, and managerial context.This paper was accepted by Shiva Rajgopal, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07017 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Common wisdom suggests that the “curse of knowledge” (COK), whereby better-informed individuals are unable to ignore their private information when forecasting others’ beliefs, reduces the quality of communication. We study how this bias affects costly information provision by a founder who wants to raise financing from an outside investor. When the founder exhibits COK about the content of her communication, there is less information provision and payoffs tend to be lower for both players. However, we show that when the founder exhibits COK about the context of her message, the bias can lead to more information production and better investment decisions. Moreover, this can exacerbate the conflict of interest between the founder and the outsider.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01839 .</content>

    <title>The politics of impact: How political ideology shapes perceptions of the environmental impact of individual actions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although consumers who engage in the same sustainable behaviors objectively have the same environmental impact, this research finds that people's perceptions of that impact are subjective and systematically shaped by political ideology. Seven studies demonstrate that conservatives tend to perceive their sustainable actions to have less of a positive impact on the environment than liberals do, which predicts conservatives' lower engagement in sustainable behaviors. This effect occurs not just because of their own climate change beliefs, but also because of the lower observed prevalence of sustainable behaviors in their in‐group. Consistent with this mechanism, when (a) the behavior is presented in a domain where it is seen as more prevalent among conservatives' ingroup members (i.e., health vs. sustainability), (b) the message emphasizes the prevalence of sustainable actions within the ingroup, or (c) impact is explicitly communicated, conservatives' perceptions of impact and their willingness to engage in sustainable behaviors increase. This work contributes to the literature on political ideology, highlighting effective ways to promote sustainable behavior across the political spectrum.</content>

    <title>Strategic positioning and accelerating regulatory clearance for new ventures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do new ventures strategically position their products to accelerate regulatory clearance? We investigate this question in the medical device industry, where regulatory clearance is a prerequisite for market entry. We examine 239 new firms' 510(k) device clearances by the FDA between 2001 and 2019. Our approach combines quantitative analysis of firms' claims of similarity with extensive field research. We find that strategic positioning significantly impacts time to clearance, and that effective strategies evolve over time. For first products, firms accelerate clearance by citing fewer reference products while strategically positioning relative to same‐category products and to category exemplars; for second products, firms accelerate clearance by referencing their own products. These findings extend positioning theory into regulatory contexts and reveal how a firm's optimal strategic positioning changes across successive products.Managerial SummaryWe study how new medical device startups can speed up regulatory approval by strategically positioning their products for the FDA. Analyzing 239 firms' 510(k) clearances from 2001 to 2019, we find that the way companies frame their products for regulators plays a key role in how quickly they are cleared. For their first products, firms benefit from referencing fewer existing devices and aligning with well‐known or similar products.

We highlight how the most effective strategy changes as a company grows, offering practical guidance for leaders bringing new medical technologies to market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a present-value identity relating a firm’s market value to expected future markups, output growth, discount rates, and investments. Distinguishing current from expected markups reveals five empirical facts: (1) Expected markups account for half the rise in U.S. firm values since 1980. (2) The rise in aggregate expected markups reflects market-share reallocation toward high-expected-markup firms and within-firm increases. (3) Expected markups are linked to intangible investments. (4) They relate negatively to discount rates over time but (5) positively to abnormal returns across firms. Finally, variation in long-term expected markups is primarily associated with asset prices rather than current markups.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing Limited Capacity under Consumer Deliberation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The pricing of limited capacity is a pivotal issue in many business contexts such as event ticket sales and online flash sales. Prior studies overlook consumer deliberation behavior in the presence of supply limits, leading to ineffective pricing decisions. This motivates investigation of consumer deliberation behavior under supply limits, and the capacity-constrained firm’s pricing and operational strategies. We first show that severe supply limits inhibit consumers’ costly deliberation, while moderate supply limits enhance consumer deliberation as the availability enhancement effect of deliberation reaches its highest potency. Accordingly, the firm with intermediate capacity tends to adopt a normal pricing strategy, i.e., pricing as in the market of informed consumers. However, when the capacity is relatively low (sufficiently high), the firm can charge a relatively high (low) price to induce (deter) consumer deliberation, i.e., transgressive (regressive) pricing; when the capacity is sufficiently low, the firm should adopt a prior value pricing strategy because consumers never deliberate. Second, on the supply side, it is not always necessary to fully utilize the limited capacity in supplying products, and for firms with high capacity, a low-quality strategy may be preferable even if quality improvement is costless. Finally, extensions to imperfect learning and heterogeneous deliberation costs show the robustness of our baseline model and offer new insights. Interestingly, the presence of demand uncertainty may benefit firms. Our study sheds light on the pricing of limited capacity and elucidates several strategic decisions when considering consumer deliberation behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A genealogical training process, in which senior (advisor) scientists mentor and train junior (advisee) scientists is one of the core organizational features of modern science. In this paper, we examine a key question faced by all junior scientists during their training: What impact does an advisee’s research agenda overlap with his or her advisor have on the advisee’s career-relevant performance outcomes? To answer this question, we constructed a novel, bibliometric-record-based data set on 11,289 U.S. biomedical scientists (advisees) who were trained in 5,632 principal investigator advisors’ labs between 1985 and 2009. We examined the relationship between advisor–advisee research overlap and an array of performance outcomes for emerging scientists, revealing a consistently positive relationship between high advisor–advisee research overlap and the junior scientist’s early-career funding outcomes. We further provide evidence that this positive relationship rests upon enhanced tacit knowledge transfer, as well as providing suggestive evidence for the boundary conditions of an intellectual independence imperative and potential competition between advisors and advisees. Taken together, these findings provide a more complete understanding of how advisor–advisee relationships shape new scientists’ performance during their early careers.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17601 .</content>

    <title>Lending Leniency: The Relationship Between High-Status Affiliations and Consumer Acceptance of Products in Contested Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Markets are often sites of ongoing contestation regarding the acceptability of various product features and production practices. Although prior research has explored how producers resolve moral controversies, less attention has been paid to how they convince consumers of their products’ moral acceptability when consensus remains elusive. This study addresses this gap by examining a prominent tactic: producers’ strategic affiliations with high-status moral advisors. We theorize that such affiliations reassure consumers, making them more likely to accept reduced financial returns for products bearing a strong stamp of moral approval. We test and find support for this argument using data on 1,540 Shariah-compliant bonds, or sukuk, where there has been ongoing debate over what product features are allowed according to Islam. We find that sukuk endorsed by high-status Shariah scholars (sheikhs) have significantly lower coupon rates, indicating consumers’ willingness to accept reduced financial returns in exchange for moral reassurance. Additionally, the impact of high-status endorsements weakens as sukuk adhere more closely to strict moral interpretations, highlighting a compensatory relationship between status signals and substantive product features. Supplementary analyses reveal that issuers are more likely to seek endorsements from high-status moral advisors when their products are complex or opaque. Overall, this research helps to build a more comprehensive picture of the tactics producers use to overcome the challenges of contested moral markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic portfolio model incorporating capital gains tax (CGT), transaction costs, and year-end taxation. We find that even tiny transaction costs can lead to significant deferral of large losses and that transaction costs affect loss deferrals much more than gain deferrals. Our model can thus help explain the puzzle that even when investors face equal long-term/short-term CGT rates, they may still defer realizing large capital losses for an extended period of time, displaying the disposition effect. In addition, we find that misestimating transaction costs is costly. We also provide several unique, empirically testable predictions and shed light on recently proposed tax policy changes.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: M.

    <title>Simple and (Approximately) Optimal Mechanism in Efficiency and Equality Tradeoff</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many large cities have adopted a policy of restricting the number of new vehicle licenses in order to address the challenges of traffic and air pollution problems. An important question that then arises is how to allocate these limited new license quotas among a large set of demanders while taking both social efficiency and equality into consideration. Inspired by this practical problem, we study the problem of designing simple and optimal mechanisms to tradeoff between efficiency and equality in a similar public goods allocation problem. We first propose a truthful two-group mechanism framework that is both general and simple and then use it to compute the optimal solution that maximizes social efficiency while guaranteeing a certain level of equality. Interestingly and surprisingly, under some natural conditions regarding the players’ private values, we show that the optimal mechanisms within the proposed framework are always the mechanisms that first run an auction and then run a lottery (ATL for short). In addition, beyond the framework and those conditions, we prove that the ATL mechanism can always guarantee at least [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] is the minimum equality level) of the optimal solution efficiency. This approximation ratio can in practice be further improved to near-optimal when resources are scarce and the natural conditions hold. We further establish a theoretical connection between these natural conditions and common value distributions, demonstrating that these conditions are widely satisfied in practice. Finally, we implement several experiments to verify the ATL mechanism’s optimality and robustness.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72401252, 72192830, 72192832, 62472428, 72192804, 72301235, 72394360 and 72394363]; the Public Computing Cloud, Renmin University of China, the fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) of Renmin University of China; the Beijing Natural Science Foundation [Grant Z220001].Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02785 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large body of research shows that even when information is accessible, consumers often fail to attend to it. To what extent and under what conditions can firms profit from such consumer inattention? We study this question theoretically and empirically in the used car market, focusing on the widely documented left-digit bias. Theoretically, firms can profit from targeting the most inattentive consumers even when there is an active decentralized market for used goods trading. Leveraging a detailed dataset of millions of automobile transactions from a seven-year period, we find that consumers exhibit inattention in the form of left-digit bias to the odometer, and such inattention is estimated to be significantly more for consumers who buy from firms. Compared to private sellers, car dealerships transact with ex-post significantly more left-digit-biased consumers. Dealerships sell more vehicles with odometer readings below round numbers, sell them faster, and extract higher margins from these vehicles. Our results imply that intermediaries can “skim” consumers with specific behavioral biases and extract meaningful surplus from selling to them.</content>

    <title>Joining Decision‐Making, Moral Thinking, and Collective Action: Grand Challenges as a Phenomenology of Deliberation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This conceptual article argues that the mutual relevance ofgrand challengesand organization and management studies is best approached phenomenologically. Rather than constituting objects to be theorized or denoting special empirical contexts, grand challenges structure researchers’ attention and shape their interpretations of the processes and systems of deliberation through which collective action is coordinated. From this perspective, grand challenges require researchers to innovate their understandings of deliberation and to ensure that newly generated knowledge is redirected towards management and policymaking. The article integrates the Carnegie School theory of organization with French pragmatic sociology’s theory of justification, oreconomies of worth, to develop a phenomenological model of situated deliberation that links decision‐making with moral reasoning. This model highlights deliberation’s articulated, evaluative, contestable, and trans‐institutional character, as well as its grounding in the cognitive capacities and sociality of actors and observers – regardless of the scale, scope, or stratification of the underlying coordination problems. Building on this framework, the article advocates that grand challenge researchers adopt the standpoint ofentrepreneurial observers: actors anchored by socio‐economic and scientific commitments who envision the integration of previously disjointed social systems of deliberation to orient collective action.</content>

    <title>How Gender Diversity and Equality in R&amp;amp;D Departments Jointly Affect Firm-Level Innovation Through Innovation Capabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovation research has long shown that firms depend on their R&amp;D personnel to strengthen their innovation capabilities, sparking scholarly interest in how to best staff R&amp;D departments for competitive advantage, with a focus on gender diversity. However, left unexamined are the mechanisms linking gender diversity in R&amp;D departments and firm-level innovation. Further, despite growing interest in the conditions under which diversity may enhance innovation, researchers have not adequately addressed how department-level gender rank inequality—the disproportionate concentration of men and women at various hierarchical ranks—interacts with numerical diversity to affect innovation outcomes. We address both limitations by integrating insights from the information/decision-making perspective on diversity and research on inequality with research on innovation capabilities. Specifically, we develop and test a model explaining how R&amp;D department gender diversity and gender rank equality jointly affect three firm-level innovation capabilities: breadth of external knowledge search, use of external knowledge, and quality of the innovation implementation process. We also examine the indirect effects of gender diversity on firm-level innovation, conditional on gender rank equality, via these capabilities. Our analyses of 552 corporate R&amp;D departments over 12 years show how gender diversity and gender rank equality in R&amp;D departments jointly relate to higher levels of all three firm-level innovation capabilities and, indirectly, to greater firm-level innovation. Our findings suggest that improving a firm’s innovation capabilities and performance requires both increased representation of women in R&amp;D departments and proportional representation of men and women at all ranks of R&amp;D departments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on insights from the knowledge-based view of the firm, we introduce a path that links founders’ founding experience to organizational design choices in tech-based ventures that instill absorptive capacity, which, in turn, allows them to produce innovation output at scale. We hypothesize that founders’ recognition of the importance of knowledge management, and their acquisition of skills to implement knowledge management systems effectively, underlie this venture-building path. We also suggest that this path is stronger when experienced founders have been exposed to venture capital investors in their prior ventures. We test our theoretical predictions with a longitudinal sample of 1,560 U.S. tech-based ventures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the yield curve dynamics in a general equilibrium model with financial intermediaries facing financing constraints. When constraints bind, intermediaries reallocate their portfolios, causing deadweight losses in aggregate consumption, thus affecting savers’ marginal utility. Because the yield curve is a forecast of marginal utility, intermediaries’ constraints show up, via general equilibrium forces, in long-term yields. I show that the mechanism connecting intermediaries’ constraints and long-term yields produces highly nonlinear interest rate dynamics and a positive real term premium in equilibrium. I extend the analysis to the nominal yield curve using a simple Taylor rule.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study “Algorithmic Market Makers” (AMs) that use Q-learning algorithms to set prices for a risky asset. We find that while AMs successfully adapt to adverse selection, they struggle to learn competitive pricing strategies. This failure is driven by limited experimentation and noisy feedback regarding the profitability of undercutting a competitor. Consequently, an increase in AMs’ profit volatility tends to result in less competitive market outcomes. These features leave identifiable patterns: for example, AMs earn higher rents in the absence of adverse selection, and their bid-ask spreads respond asymmetrically to symmetric shocks to their costs.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of underquoting, the practice of setting listing prices below sellers’ reservation values, on housing auctions. Laws introduced in Australia to deter underquoting lead to higher listing prices, but also to declines in sales prices and sales probabilities. We develop a quantitative model to formalize predictions under different assumptions about bidders’ information and rationality. The effects of the laws are matched by a version of the model in which participating bidders overbid. While both behavioral biases arising during the auction and switching costs can explain overbidding, empirical and survey evidence points to behavioral biases as the main mechanism.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We apply classical statistical decision theory to a large class of treatment choice problems with partial identification. We show that, in a general class of problems with Gaussian likelihood, all decision rules are admissible; it is maximin-welfare optimal to ignore all data; and, for severe enough partial identification, there are infinitely many minimax-regret optimal decision rules, all of which sometimes randomize the policy recommendation. We uniquely characterize the minimax-regret optimal rule that least frequently randomizes, and show that, in some cases, it can outperform other minimax-regret optimal rules in terms of what we term profiled regret. We analyze the implications of our results in the aggregation of experimental estimates for policy adoption, extrapolation of Local Average Treatment Effects, and policy making in the presence of omitted variable bias.</content>

    <title>Survey of Data-driven Newsvendor: Unified Analysis and Spectrum of Achievable Regrets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unifying the Regret Spectrum in Data-Driven NewsvendorThe data-driven newsvendor problem seeks to optimize inventory decisions using samples from an unknown demand distribution. Although this problem has attracted significant attention, previous studies have typically analyzed specific distribution classes or regret definitions in isolation. In “Survey of the Data-Driven Newsvendor Problem: Unified Analysis and Spectrum of Achievable Regrets,” Chen and Ma present a unified analysis that synthesizes these settings and simplifies existing proofs. The study utilizes a notion of clustered distributions defined via the cumulative distribution function (CDF). This approach demonstrates that the achievable regret covers the entire spectrum of convergence rates between $1/\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$. Beyond the theoretical unification, the authors show through simulations that this CDF-based notion accurately predicts the empirical regret and captures how the difficulty of the problem evolves with sample size. This work provides insights into understanding the value of data in the newsvendor problem and, more broadly, decision making under uncertainty.</content>

    <title>The Need for Fees at a DEX: How Increases in Fees Can Increase DEX Trading Volume</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model endogenous trading and liquidity provision at a decentralized exchange (DEX) and demonstrate that increasing DEX trading fees can increase DEX trading volume. DEXs employ a mechanical pricing rule whereby price impacts decrease with inventory that DEXs acquire by offering fee revenues to investors. Consequently, higher DEX fees can incentivize higher inventory, thereby reducing price impacts. Moreover, the reduction of price impact can offset the increase in fees so that the marginal cost of DEX trading declines despite charging a higher trading fee. In turn, lower DEX marginal trading costs lead to an increase in DEX trading volume.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Integration decisions are not isolated, as they are embedded in an organizational context. Using a multi‐country sample (Nordics, German speaking Europe, and China) of small‐ and medium‐sized acquirers, we explore the influence of firm strategic orientations on how managers conceptualize acquisitions, make integration decisions, and impact acquisition performance. Both market‐ and entrepreneurial‐oriented firms coordinate activities following an acquisition, but they do so differently. Entrepreneurial‐oriented acquirers use human integration to align target managers with common goals and reinforce their decision‐making autonomy. In contrast, market‐oriented acquirers strive for functional integration and use human integration to reduce target firm managers' decision‐making autonomy. Thus, achieving coordination after an acquisition can follow different paths that are closely aligned with the strategic orientation of the acquirer. In other words, different strategic orientations guide managers' decisions, resulting in different paths to acquisition success.</content>

    <title>Accounting Rules and the Labor Market for Accountants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, I explore how accounting rules—in particular the restrictiveness of GAAP—have impacted the labor market for accountants. I find that when the rules become more restrictive, there are fewer students majoring in accounting and fewer accountants and auditors overall. The overall number of accounting positions that firms recruit for does not decrease when the rules become more restrictive; however, the nature of accountants' work changes. There is less focus on tasks such as applying judgment, thinking creatively, and thinking critically and more focus on determining compliance. Despite the decrease in accountants, earnings for accountants do not increase, and the wage distribution becomes more compressed. I supplement these analyses with a survey‐based field experiment and find that the salience of restrictiveness heightens students' views of accounting as a profession where they are unable to use creative and critical thinking. Overall, the findings suggest that restrictive regulation can shift the task content of occupations and reduce the pool of individuals interested in the profession.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Institutional alignment comprises the integration of sanctioned organizational models and standardized managerial roles, thus reconstructing traditional organizations as contemporary actors with homogenous global identities. We adopt this perspective to illuminate the processes by which a business family homogenizes to conform to the global world order, through extensive use of advisors and management consultants. To do so, we narrate the experience of a third-generation Israeli-based multinational enterprise. We find that the cumulative adoption of standardized corporate organizational models periodically shifts the family’s decision-making reference points, enabling it to expand its product and geographic scope and act as a global player.</content>

    <title>The Double-Edged Sword of Entrepreneurial Orientation: Product Recalls and the Role of COO Power</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) influences firms’ likelihood of product recalls. Integrating EO and upper echelons theory, we first argue that EO’s bold, variance-enhancing actions increase a firm’s product recall risk by diverting managerial attention away from quality control. Using 23 years of data on U.S. public firms, we find that EO increases recall likelihood. Second, we argue that this relationship is moderated by chief operating officer (COO) power, and the effectiveness of COO power is contingent on the firm’s product life cycle context. Empirical analyses support our theory and offer new insights about EO’s potential downsides.</content>

    <title>Collision in the boardroom: Director skill
                    &lt;scp&gt;interdependence&lt;/scp&gt;

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Board human capital theory posits that directors' skills shape firm behavior. Most studies, however, examine one skill type at a time, assuming that each director contributes independently of the other skills represented on the board. We introduce the concept ofdirector skill interdependence, theorizing that a director's influence depends on the skills of fellow directors and their committee assignments. Focusing on entrepreneurial directors in technology‐intensive firms, we find that they increase resource allocation toward corporate entrepreneurship (CE); however, this effect diminishes as the number of finance‐skilled directors increases, whether on the board or on its corporate development committee. These findings challenge the view of directors' skills as isolated inputs. Instead, the effects of directors' skills are contingent on the board's skill composition and committee structure.Managerial SummaryIn technology‐intensive firms, directors with entrepreneurial skills are often expected to stimulate corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Our findings suggest this relationship is less straightforward. While entrepreneurial directors do increase investment in CE, their impact weakens when directors with finance skills are prevalent on the board or its corporate development committee. These results underscore the importance ofdirector skill interdependence—the idea that a director's influence depends on the skills and roles of fellow directors. Boards should therefore consider not only who is appointed, but also how directors' skills align with one another and how those skills are deployed through committee assignments. Preventing the dominance of conflicting skill sets may enhance the board's ability to support innovation, venturing, and long‐term strategic renewal.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the unconditional distribution of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) using clustering regression applied to the 2008 economic stimulus payments. By deviating from the standard approach of estimating MPC heterogeneity using interactions with observables, we can recover the full distribution of MPCs. We find households spent between 4 and 133% of the rebate within a quarter, and individual households used rebates for different goods. While many observable characteristics correlate individually with our estimated MPCs, most of these relationships disappear when tested jointly. Notable exceptions are income and the average propensity to consume, which correlate positively with the MPC. Household observable characteristics explain only 8% of MPC variation, highlighting the role of latent heterogeneity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies have shown that the standard law of belief updating—Bayes' rule—is descriptively invalid in various settings. In this paper, I introduce and analyze a generalization of Bayes' rule—Coarse Bayesian updating—accommodating much of the empirical evidence. I characterize the model axiomatically, show how it generates several well-known biases, and derive its main implications in static and dynamic settings. Each axiom expresses a property of Bayes' rule but, conditional on the others, stops just short of making the agent fully Bayesian. The model employs standard primitives, making it suitable for applications; I demonstrate this by applying it to a standard setting of decision under risk, leading to a close relationship with the Blackwell information ordering and comparative measures of cognitive sophistication and bias.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study narratives about the macroeconomy—the stories people tell to explain macroeconomic phenomena—in the context of a historic surge in inflation. In our empirical analysis, we field surveys with more than 10,000 US households and 100 academic experts, measure economic narratives in open-ended questions, and represent them as Directed Acyclic Graphs. Households’ narratives are strongly heterogeneous, coarser than experts’ narratives, focus more on the supply than the demand side, and often feature politically charged explanations. Moreover, narratives shape how households form inflation expectations and interpret new information, which we demonstrate in a series of experiments. Informed by these findings, our theoretical analysis incorporates narratives into an otherwise conventional New Keynesian model and demonstrates their importance for aggregate outcomes through their effect on agents’ expectations.</content>

    <title>Knowing Enough to Be Dangerous: The Problem of “Artificial Certainty” for Expert Authority When Using AI for Decision Making and Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how experts who use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that generate highly detailed and realistic representations can create what we term “artificial certainty,” which we define as the illusion that complex future outcomes are definitively knowable, even though they are inherently uncertain. Through a comparative study of two urban planning organizations using the same AI simulation tool, we show how this artificial certainty emerges from the ways process experts create and deploy AI-generated representations. The findings reveal three interconnected representational practices that shape how laypeople perceive the certainty of a representation: controlling the level of detail, shaping stakeholder engagement, and constructing the model’s meaning. We find that when process experts emphasize enhancement—amplifying technological capabilities within these practices—stakeholders mistake representations for reality, undermining expert authority. Conversely, when process experts engage in modulation—tempering how AI outputs are presented and integrated into decision making—they preserve the authority necessary to keep uncertainty alive. These findings reconceptualize process expertise as a distinct form of interpretive work that helps maintain useful levels of uncertainty in the face of growing pressures toward artificial certainty. Based on these insights, we develop a critical distinction between representations of the future versus representations for the future, offering new ways to theorize decision making under uncertainty as organizations increasingly deploy sophisticated AI systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grants SES-1057148 and SES-2051896].</content>

    <title>Online Learning and Optimization for Queues with Unknown Arrival Rate and Service Distribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;End-to-End Optimization for Queues Beyond PTOMost queueing optimization methods rely on a predict-then-optimize (PTO) paradigm, which first estimates key model primitives (e.g., demand rates and service-time distributions) and then optimizes system decisions using these estimates as if they were exact. In practice, however, queueing performance formulas are often highly sensitive to estimation errors, especially under congestion, making such approaches fragile and potentially misleading. In “Online Learning and Optimization for Queues with Unknown Arrival Rate and Service Distribution,” X. Chen, G. Hong, and Y. Liu develop a new end-to-end online learning framework for jointly optimizing pricing and capacity decisions in service systems, called LiQUAR (learning in queue with unknown arrival rate). LiQUAR is specialized to queueing systems by explicitly leveraging workload dynamics and transient behavior, allowing it to learn directly from arrival and service data without requiring prior knowledge of the demand function or the service-time distribution. Designing online learning algorithms for queues poses unique challenges: Data are temporally correlated, system dynamics are disrupted by policy updates, and performance is highly sensitive to congestion. LiQUAR addresses these challenges through queue-aware algorithm design and analysis, establishing regret bounds that capture the effect of traffic intensity and demonstrating superior performance to PTO and gradient-based reinforcement learning methods, particularly in heavily loaded systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of gender in corporate debt renegotiation. Using in-court reorganizations from Brazil, we find that male-led creditors are more likely to reject plans put forward by female-led debtors. Although we cannot definitively identify the underlying mechanism driving this pattern, our findings align more consistently with gender-based discrimination compared with alternative explanations. This behavior may be costly: Female-led debtors deliver higher recoveries under reorganization than under liquidation, implying that rejections potentially create deadweight losses. Supporting a miscalibrated-beliefs explanation, we observe that the gender-based rejection gap narrows when male creditors have prior exposure to successful female-led businesses, pointing to a potential path for mitigation.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05802 .</content>

    <title>The Impacts of “Baby-Friendly” Hospital Designations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study considers a voluntary hospital certification program and how it shapes patient health outcomes. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative designates participating hospitals as “Baby-Friendly” if they adhere to various practices thought to promote breastfeeding. We estimate the effect of being born in a Baby-Friendly hospital on breastfeeding initiation and infant health. Identification relies on a within-mother analysis that compares siblings who were born in the same hospital: one when the hospital was not certified and another when the hospital was certified. Data come from South Carolina birth certificates from 2010 to 2019 linked to subsequent emergency department records, hospital records, and death certificates. The results indicate that Baby-Friendly accreditation has no widespread effects on breastfeeding initiation. It does, however, increase breastfeeding rates among a subset of Black mothers with a history of bottle-feeding. Infants exposed to the designation are more likely to leave the hospital in under two days, and there is also some evidence of subsequent reductions in healthcare utilization in the next year. We do not find precise changes in all-cause one-year mortality, although we do observe a marginally significant reduction in deaths caused by “extreme immaturity.”This paper was accepted by Anita Carson, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06422 .</content>

    <title>Eliciting Supplier Cooperation for Value Chain Decarbonization: A Field Experiment with Smallholder Farmers in India</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms are pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across their value chains. However, this requires their suppliers to also adopt more climate-friendly practices for decarbonization. This can involve addressing gaps in not only the suppliers’ ability but also, their willingness to adopt such practices, which can be challenging if the suppliers perceive the practices as risky or potentially detrimental to their economic well-being. We examine the effectiveness of relational investments to help mitigate this challenge, arguing that such investments can serve as a signal of the firm’s commitment toward joint value creation. In a field experiment conducted with supplier farmers in a multinational firm’s agricultural supply chain in India, we examine the impact of two kinds of relational investments in providing the farmers with customized agricultural services that they valued. In the first intervention, the firm’s field officers offered the farmers support specific to the crop that the firm sourced from them. The second intervention additionally involved bringing in expert agronomists to also provide the farmers with support on broader agricultural matters of interest to them. Relative to a control condition in which the farmers only received training on the relevant climate-friendly practices, both interventions improved the farmers’ adoption of the recommended practices. The second intervention was more impactful than the first in improving the farmers’ practice adoption as well as their retention with the firm. Exploratory mediation analysis and post-experiment field interviews suggest that these findings are partly driven by the farmers’ positive perception of the firm’s relational investments.This paper was accepted by Anita McGahan, business strategy.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from INSEAD [Kurt Björklund Research Fund].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05744 .</content>

    <title>Nudging Green-but-Slow Shipping Choices in Online Retail</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Faster e-commerce fulfillment often comes at a cost to the environment because of energy-intensive transportation modes and more frequent, less consolidated last-mile deliveries. Despite these environmental implications, most retailers feel pressure to provide fast fulfillment to remain competitive. But what if consumers could be nudged to voluntarily choose green-but-slow shipping? In practice, a variety of information strategies are used to nudge such decisions, but it is unclear which strategy is best and why. This study examines these questions in two logistical contexts, each involving a different type of process change to support green-but-slow shipping: shipping mode and order consolidation. We first introduce a conceptual framework for selecting information strategies based on their influence on customer perceptions related to key stakeholders in each context: delivery convenience (self), environmental impact (society), and sustainability intention (retailer). Then, drawing on behavioral research and industry practices, we identify and test the effect of a comprehensive set of information strategies (i.e., Process, Green Label, Green Process, and Green Outcome) through controlled experiments involving 3,800 participants. Experimental results suggest that different logistical contexts require distinct nudging strategies, aligning with our conceptual framework. We find that including a green label is particularly effective for the shipping mode context, especially when combined with outcome information. In contrast, process information is more promising in the order consolidation context. Also, adding financial incentives can enhance the effectiveness of information strategies without a clear environmental signal, whereas pairing them with a simple green label may be effective for low eco-conscious individuals.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota [MF-0009-23].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00239 .</content>

    <title>Can Autonomous Vehicles Solve the Commuter Parking Problem?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how autonomous vehicles (AVs) may reshape morning commute travel patterns and impact parking in a central business district (CBD). We develop a continuous-time game-theoretic traffic model that takes into account key economic deterrents to driving, such as parking fees and traffic congestion, and characterize the departure time and parking location (inside or outside the CBD parking area) patterns of commuters in equilibrium. Our analysis shows that all AV commuters may choose to park outside the CBD in equilibrium, increasing both vehicle hours and vehicle miles traveled as compared with the case with all human-driven vehicles. This change increases the total system cost and suggests a potential for CBD land use changes (e.g., repurposing CBD parking spots as commercial and residential areas) after the mass adoption of AVs. To reduce the total system cost, an urban planner may regulate commuters’ decisions by adjusting parking fees and/or imposing congestion tolls as a short-term measure, or adjusting infrastructure, for example, converting CBD parking spaces to drop-off spots for AVs. Our results indicate that these measures can reduce the total system cost substantially (e.g., up to [Formula: see text] when calibrating our model to data from Pittsburgh).This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01213 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have long and effectively used qualitative-inductive methodologies to understand the heterogeneous responses of established organizations—so-called incumbents—to emerging discontinuous technologies. However, after nearly 30 years of nuanced, contextualized qualitative research in this area, there is a unique opportunity—and essentially a need—for its distillation, integration, and critical reflection. In particular, while qualitative studies on heterogeneous incumbent responses aspire to develop “theories of the middle range,” and, thus, to acknowledge boundary conditions and contextual nuances, in practice, they rarely discuss a given theory’s range systematically. This disconnect limits the comparability, generalizability, and integration of findings. To address this instability, we inductively and critically review 127 qualitative studies on incumbents’ responses to discontinuous technologies published between 1998 and 2024. The central outcome of our review is an integrative framework of core contextual dimensions of incumbent responses to emerging discontinuous technologies, organized along six attributes related to the overarching domains of technology, market, and organization and institutions. Our distilled framework provides a taxonomic map for systematically comparing different empirical contexts of incumbent adaptation to discontinuous technologies and critically considering the boundary conditions of qualitatively induced theorizing in this regard. Our framework also enables us to present an encompassing program for future qualitative research on incumbent heterogeneity, one of the core phenomena underlying the overall process of creative destruction.</content>

    <title>From Shield to Sword: How Data Privacy Can Undermine Data Security</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the point in hacking computer systems when organizations voluntarily disclose personal data to anyone who asks convincingly? We show that the European GDPR is paradoxically exploitable for identity theft despite being designed to protect personal data. Subject access requests (SARs) according to its “right of access” (Article 15) can be weaponized by impersonating a victim and submitting fraudulent SARs in their name. We task attackers with stealing the personal data of three volunteers (highly privacy aware person, average user, and semipublic figure) in a real-world setting. These attacks could be replicated by just about anyone. Yet, they obtained sensitive personal data, including addresses, phone numbers, national ID and bank account information, and insurance data. Based on 718 submitted SARs and 21 interviews with data protection officers, we tell a frightening, yet fascinating story of how these identity thefts unfold, expose flaws in how organizations process SARs, and uncover a systemic weakness in the GDPR. We analyze the underlying factors enabling such attacks, assess their real-world impact, and explore mitigation options for individuals, organizations, and lawmakers. Our insights have important implications for how data privacy and data security interrelate and how we manage and regulate them.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting (QQ) has emerged as a prominent topic in both popular press and academic research, reflecting shifts in employees' engagement, effort allocation, and responses to contemporary work pressures. This review synthesizes findings from 11 papers published in a recent Special Issue onThe Disquiet of Quiet Quitting. We integrate conceptual, empirical, and methodological insights from these papers and other recent literature to clarify what QQ is and what it is not. We highlight the multidimensional nature of QQ, distinguishing deliberate and passive forms, reactive versus value‐driven motivations, and variations in scope and behavioral expression. We then propose a 2 × 2 typology of quiet quitters (Protesters, Faders, Boundary Setters, and Indifferent Drifters) constructed along two key dimensions, intentionality and motivational basis, to capture the heterogeneity of behaviors and underlying motives. Finally, we discuss implications for theory, measurement, and practice, emphasizing how QQ signals broader dynamics in employment relationships, including fairness, well‐being, and sustainable engagement, and we identify directions for future research, including longitudinal, multi‐level, and cross‐cultural investigations.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global Versus Local Temperature</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates that the macroeconomic damages from climate change are an order of magnitude larger than previously thought. Exploiting natural global temperature variability, we find that 1○C warming reduces world GDP by over 20% in the long run. Global temperature correlates strongly with extreme climatic events, unlike country-level temperature used in previous work, explaining our larger estimate. We use this evidence to estimate damage functions in a neoclassical growth model. Business-as-usual warming implies a present welfare loss of more than 30%, and a Social Cost of Carbon in excess of $1,200 per ton. These impacts suggest that unilateral decarbonization policy is cost-effective for large countries such as the United States.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that the degree of extrapolative weighting in investors’ beliefs (DOX) has strong predictive power for a broad set of overreaction-related anomalies in the stock market. The average return spread of these anomalies is about [Formula: see text] per month following high DOX periods and [Formula: see text] per month following low DOX periods. In sharp contrast, DOX has opposite, but weaker, predictive power for underreaction-related anomalies. In addition, the predictive power of DOX is robust after controlling for a broad set of economic forces. Moreover, most of the DOX effect on long-short anomaly returns derives from the short legs of these overreaction-related anomalies, suggesting that time variation in DOX leads to more time variation in overpricing than in underpricing, probably because of short-sale impediments.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Z.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a unique data set of individual housing transaction histories from Norway and a novel shift-share design to show that temporary changes in the transaction sequencing decisions of moving homeowners—whether to buy first and then sell or vice versa—cause temporary local increases in house prices and seller liquidity. Our findings are consistent with a simple theory of how transaction sequencing decisions impact house prices in a frictional housing market. We also provide the first causal estimate of the elasticity of house prices to market tightness, which is around 0.1. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of trading frictions and supply-demand imbalances for housing market dynamics.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Norges Forskningsråd [Grant 274678: Frictions in the Housing Market].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08149 .</content>

    <title>In Search of Shares: Benchmarked Ownership, Short Covering, and Price Efficiency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether ownership by benchmarked investors constrains short sellers’ ability to quickly cover their positions following positive earnings news and thereby exacerbates price pressure from short covering. We find that high benchmarked ownership is related to greater price overshooting in highly shorted stocks at positive earnings announcements. This effect is driven by benchmarked ownership amplifying both price and volume impacts of short covering. Exploring shocks from Russell index reconstitutions and examining other settings such as management guidance and analyst recommendation revisions yield similar inferences. Overall, our findings highlight a novel mechanism that benchmarked ownership can constrain short-selling activities.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial assistance from their respective schools.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07231 .</content>

    <title>Bond Risk Characteristics and Factor Risk Premia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Assuming no arbitrage and that a polynomial in the time to maturity approximates spot-rate increments, we develop a consistent approach to estimate factor risk premia in the bond market. This approach is attractive, as the underlying risk factors are the time-varying coefficients of the polynomial specification, and the factor loadings correspond to familiar bond risk characteristics, such as duration and convexity. Our two-factor model—with a positive (negative) duration-factor (convexity-factor) risk premium—is easy to estimate and provides straightforward economic intuition for the concave term structure of bond risk premia and the downward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. Our model decomposes the conditional factor risk premia into a “status quo” component—the expected factors’ realizations when expected spot-rate increments are zero—and the factors’ forecasts. The status quo factor risk premia provide measures of the state of fixed income markets that both outperform alternative measures and are easily estimated in real time; moreover, the underlying risk factors and their loadings are familiar to and readily interpreted by investors and traders.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00212 .</content>

    <title>High-investment human resource practices and firm performance in the context of national education systems and labor markets: A cross-national meta-analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations—especially multinational corporations (MNCs)—do not always realize comparable performance gains from investing in people across national borders. Prior research has attempted to explain such variation in the effects of high-investment human resource practices (HIHRPs) by emphasizing their fit with national cultural values, yet empirical support for this cultural fit perspective has been limited. To address this gap, we focus on national institutional factors that more directly shape how HIHRPs influence performance. Drawing on human capital resources (HCR) theory and institutional perspectives in International Business (IB), we identify two institutional conditions—national education quality and labor market flexibility—that moderate HIHRP effectiveness. We theorize that high-quality education systems enhance the HIHRPs–performance relationship by supplying workers with strong general human capital and that this effect is amplified in flexible labor markets where employees are motivated to contribute. A meta-analysis of 1,285 effect sizes from 170,938 organizations across 29 countries offers nuanced evidence: HIHRPs were more effective when national education quality and labor market flexibility were both highorboth low than when they were mismatched. These findings advance comparative and strategic HRM research and guide organizations about how comprehensively or selectively to invest in managing people in what institutional contexts.</content>

    <title>NFT Disruption in Platform Competition: Evidence from Trading Card Collectibles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of blockchain-based platforms is reshaping how digital and physical products interact, with important consequences for platform strategy and market regulation. Evidence from the introduction of NBA Top Shot shows that digital collectibles can directly reduce prices, sales volume, and market value in adjacent physical markets, indicating a clear cannibalization effect. However, the impact is highly uneven: Physical products with close digital substitutes and low digital scarcity become especially vulnerable, whereas low-cost items in certain segments can experience market expansion as new collectors enter through digital channels. These patterns demonstrate that digital transformation alters competition not only between platforms but also across product categories, making strategic decisions around scarcity, product design, and release timing critical for firms managing multiformat ecosystems. For practice, the findings highlight the need for companies to anticipate cross-market spillovers when launching digital offerings and to manage physical and digital product lines in an integrated way. For policy, the results underscore the importance of establishing transparent standards for digital collectibles and providing clear consumer guidance, while recognizing that many NFTs function as collectible goods rather than financial securities and may warrant distinct regulatory treatment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hybrid entrepreneurship—pursuing a venture while maintaining paid employment—can enhance or undermine well-being. Based on a longitudinal, qualitative study, we identify two distinct trajectories shaped by envisioned future selves: delayed entrepreneurial gratification with cumulative strains on well-being, and present gratification with supportive effects on well-being. Drawing on role identity theory, we theorize how role internalization and identity centrality relate to the well-being experiences of hybrid entrepreneurs and introduce gratification and rationalization as ways to handle strains on well-being. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the divergent well-being experiences in hybrid entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Interpreting Violence: How Community Context Shapes Corporate Responses to Street Protests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Violence that erupts in communities invites complex interpretations that can create a dilemma for business leaders about how to respond. Investigating how organizations respond to violence in protests, we build on the community embeddedness literature and propose that business leaders’ responses to protest violence depend on their perceptions of whether the violence is justified. Leaders may view reported protest violence as evidence of either social disorder or a valid grievance in the community where the violence occurs and where their companies are headquartered. We theorize that business leaders’ interpretations of violence are influenced by their community’s recent history: A history of protest violence unrelated to the social cause underlying the current protest weakens the managerial perception that the social issue is relevant to the community, while a history of grievance-validating events strengthens this perception. Using hand-collected data on corporate announcements following the 2020 Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, we find that firms are less likely to announce diversity actions in response to reported protest violence in communities marked by persistent violence in previous non-BLM protests, but they are more likely to do so in communities with records of more police shootings. These same community conditions also shape the effect of violence on whether firms decide to publicly endorse the movement when they announce their corporate actions. Demonstrating that violence reshapes the ways that organizations respond to protests, we discuss the implications of our findings for research on violence, social movements, and corporate activism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reference-dependent preferences can explain several puzzling observations about organizational change. We introduce a dynamic model in which a firm bargains with loss-averse workers about organizational change and wages. We show that change is often stagnant or slow for many periods, followed by a sudden boost in productivity triggered by a crisis. In a crisis, workers concede to organizational change but resist nominal wage reductions. In addition, the model explains why different firms in the same industry often have significant productivity differences. Finally, the model demonstrates the importance of expectations management even if all parties have rational expectations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide quasi-experimental evidence of how an innovative market-based solution using remote-sensing technology can mitigate drought-induced conflict. Droughts are a major driver of conflict in Africa, particularly between transhumant pastoralists and sedentary farmers. Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) piloted in Kenya provides automated, preemptive payouts to pastoralists affected by droughts. Combining variation in rainfall and the staggered rollout of IBLI in Kenya over the 2000-2020 period, we find that IBLI strongly reduces drought-induced conflict. Key mechanisms include a reduction in herd sizes, as well as income smoothing and asset-price stabilization, contributing to an overall reduced migratory pressure for pastoralists. Our study suggests that market-based solutions are a scalable, cost-effective pathway to mitigate conflict, complementing political solutions such as power-sharing agreements and institutional reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and this results in a higher industry profit but lower consumer surplus. Compared with their absence, loyalty programs decrease both industry profit and consumer welfare, leading to a lose–lose outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that, when the firms are heterogeneous in terms of their network sizes, those with larger networks tend to offer lower rewards yet achieve greater consumer loyalty in contrast to the firms with smaller networks, which compensate with higher rewards.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: T.T.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research reports and earnings conference calls. They also display distinct cognitive and linguistic patterns when discussing E&amp;S issues. Furthermore, female analysts are more likely to issue lower stock recommendations and target prices (lower stock recommendations) following negative E&amp;S discussions in their reports (E&amp;S incidents) than male analysts. Finally, investors respond more strongly to female analysts’ negative tones when discussing E&amp;S issues. Overall, our findings suggest that gender diversity among analysts plays a significant role in shaping corporate E&amp;S practices and provide new insights into the origins of gender differences in skills within the equity analyst profession.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: We acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2022-0285] and the Sauder Exploratory Research Grants Program.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Option wholesalers specialize in purchasing and executing against retail option order flow. Orders are internalized via auctions (which provide price improvement) and the limit order book. Designated market makers (DMMs) have a key advantage in internalizing limit order book trades: they obtain the first five contracts of any order they bring to an exchange where they are a DMM. We exploit variation in DMM assignments and allocation rules to highlight how these rules create a barrier to entry in option wholesaling that does not exist for equity wholesaling, protecting wholesaler profits and high option PFOF.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formalize a research design to uncover the mechanisms underlying long-term reductions in energy consumption caused by a widely implemented nudge. We consider two channels: technology adoption and habit formation. Using data from 38 natural field experiments, we isolate the role of technology adoption by comparing treatment and control homes after the initial resident moves, which discontinues the treatment for a home. We find that fully half of energy reductions persist in the home after treatment ends and show this persistence is consonant with a technology adoption channel. The role of technology in creating persistent behaviour change has important implications for designing behavioural interventions and evaluating their long-term social impacts.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Effects of Peer Voting and Followers on User Contribution to Online Knowledge Sharing Platforms: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online knowledge-sharing platforms such as Quora and Zhihu (a leading knowledge-sharing platform in China) often use both peer voting and followers to encourage user knowledge contributions. However, these platforms diverge in whether they highlight followers, upvotes, or both as reputation symbols. To better understand the consequences of these platform design choices, we conduct a field experiment with 1,696 focal users on Zhihu where we exogenously increase upvotes or/and followers for treated users over a 53-day intervention period. We monitor focal users’ activities for 303 days, covering both pre- and post-intervention periods. We further use a large language model to gauge the quality of 12,998 answers contributed by these users during this time. We find that increasing upvotes significantly boosts users’ answer contributions (in volume, total length, and quality), while increasing followers has mostly no overall effect on contributions. Additionally, increasing upvotes can encourage contribution for up to 100 days, particularly among lower-reputation (i.e., with fewer upvotes or followers), less active, female users, and those answering soft topic questions. In contrast, increasing followers only reduces contribution volume (not length or quality) for higher-reputation, more active, and male users. Moreover, while peer voting primarily only affects answer contributions, the follower treatment leads to negative spillovers, reducing users’ upvoting on fellow users’ answers, following fellow users, or purchasing Zhihu Lives hosted by fellow users. Our research suggests the possibility that users on knowledge-sharing platforms may associate peer voting with contributions, treating it as peer recognition that offers intrinsic motivation. In contrast, users may interpret additional followers as a symbol of status enhancement, which could, in some cases, dampen their motivation to contribute. Overall, our study suggests that platforms aiming to foster active, high-quality contributions should highlight upvotes rather than followers as a reputation symbol. To our knowledge, this study is among the first field experiments to identify and compare the causal effects of peer voting and followers on user contribution to knowledge-sharing platforms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Raise the Expectation Bar and Lower the Tolerance? Effects of Being Listed in a Restaurant Guide on Customers’ Online Rating Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creating curated guides or lists (e.g., Top 100 Places to Eat) is a common operational strategy employed by platforms as part of their reputation systems to assist customers in decision-making. Prior research has largely highlighted the effects of such guides on customer word-of-mouth (WOM) volume and valence. Moving beyond these aggregate WOM metrics, we extend this stream to examine how being listed in a guide (BLG) influences customers’ likelihood of providing ratings and rating composition across valence types (compliments, complaints, and neutral ratings), drawing on the zone of tolerance (ZOT) framework. Using large-scale empirical data, we find that BLG increases customers’ likelihood of rating but reduces overall valence, with a higher proportion of complaints and neutral ratings and a lower proportion of compliments. The effect is particularly pronounced among merchants with additional high-quality signals (e.g., higher prices, greater popularity, and superior prior ratings). Evidence from both observational data and a randomized experiment further reveals the underlying mechanisms, showing that BLG increases customer involvement and raises desired expectations more dramatically than adequate ones. These triangulated findings contribute to the literature by providing in-depth insights into how and why BLG affects customer rating behaviors and thus, merchants’ WOM. Our findings underscore the importance of strategic operations management for platforms when designing and managing their reputation systems, with significant implications for technology management.</content>

    <title>Fair Fares for Vehicle Sharing Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vehicle sharing systems—such as bike, scooter, and car sharing—play a key role in urban transportation, yet algorithmic pricing can lead to inequalities across locations. This paper studies how platforms can incorporate fairness into pricing decisions and the resulting outcomes. We propose two notions of fairness: price fairness, which limits price differences across locations, and access fairness, which equalizes the proportion of demand at each location that has access to the system, determined by affordability and availability. Using a stylized two-location model, the paper analyzes how fairness constraints affect platform revenue, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Although price fairness can sometimes increase consumer surplus at both locations, access fairness always reduces consumer surplus at both locations. A convex relaxation approach is developed for larger networks, and a case study using New York City data illustrates the tradeoffs between fairness and efficiency in practice.</content>

    <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Providers’ Compensation Contracts in Improving Participant Retention for Clinical Studies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this work, we aim to analyze a clinical study sponsor’s decisions regarding monetary payments to participants and compensation for providers (investigators and coordinators) for their efforts to improve participant retention in the study. To this end, we first consider a centralized model where the sponsor decides the monetary payments to participants and the providers’ efforts. We then identify the optimal contracts for the providers under the two decentralized team structures: the sponsor-investigator (SI) model and the outsourcing (OM) model. We further analyze three widely adopted compensation contracts for the providers: fixed (FC), linear (LC), and conditional linear (CLC) given a decentralized structure. Our theoretical analysis shows that the expected retention cost with optimal contracts under decentralized structures is at most 40% higher than that under the centralized model. However, in practical instances, this cost increase is, at the most, 8% on average. A comparison of the FC, LC, and CLC contracts reveals that it is sufficient for the sponsor to choose between the FC and the LC contracts under the SI model, whereas under the OM model, there exist cases where the sponsor is better off adopting the CLC contract. Furthermore, the sponsor’s expected retention cost when choosing the best of the three contracts is at most 6% (10%) higher on average relative to that for the optimal compensation contract under the SI (OM) model. Given a decentralized structure, we also identify cases where the optimal contract offers significant benefit over the three contracts observed in practice.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02973 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study addresses the problem of handling constraints in innovative projects. Using a qualitative research design on base of the pyramid (BOP) innovation projects, we examine how creativity emerges from constraints. By investigating responses to experienced constraints from 60 BOP innovation projects, we identify specific micro‐processes used to deal with constraints, which we introduce as constraint‐handling practices. Moreover, we investigate the interplay between these constraint‐handling practices and the nature of the constraints in the resultant sequence of such micro‐processes, distinguishing between goal and task constraints. Drawing from theory on effectuation and causation, we explain how different constraint‐handling practices are implemented in innovation projects in response to these constraints. We demonstrate that instead of relying on an either/or mode of effectuation versus causation, actors in constrained BOP innovation projects exhibit repeated cycles of both effectuation‐ and causation‐based constraint‐handling practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of cybercrime legislation globally in shaping the stability of the banking system. We compile a novel dataset covering the enactment of cybercrime legislation in 132 developed and developing countries to test this research question empirically. We find that the enactment of cybercrime laws enhances the stability of the banking sector. This key finding holds across a comprehensive suite of robustness tests, including alternative measures of bank stability and model specifications. We document significant cross-sectional heterogeneity, with the effect being more pronounced in countries with heavier penalties for illegal cyber activities and legal frameworks that hold banks accountable for their cybersecurity practices. Moreover, the positive impact is stronger in jurisdictions with greater international legal cooperation and effective enforcement mechanisms. We further investigate two channels (i.e., funding liquidity and operational risk) through which cybercrime laws may influence bank stability. Our results indicate that these laws can significantly bolster bank stability by enhancing funding liquidity and mitigating operational risk. Overall, our study provides evidence of the crucial role of cybercrime legislation in fostering a secure and resilient banking environment. It offers new insights into how these laws contribute to bank stability on both individual and systemic levels.</content>

    <title>AI Governance and the Decentralization of Technology Production: An Investigation of AI-Based IPA Bots</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit the centralization–decentralization tension in the context of decentralized technology production at the AI frontier, focusing on Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) bots as a salient manifestation of the democratization of AI. IPA bots combine robotic process automation with AI technologies and process mining based on deep, mindful domain expertise. We collaborate with a Fortune 200 multinational to study how IPA projects yield successful governance outcomes of utilization and repeatability. Our research reveals that traditional centralized mandates, when paired with the unique learning and adaptive capabilities of AI systems, can actively suppress utilization and stifle organizational reuse of the bots. Conversely, democratization is no panacea. While empowerment of business users through decentralization usually leads to successful outcomes for the deployed bots, when certain boundary conditions are crossed, these same decentralized efforts can produce fragmentation in the form of one-off solutions. Our research challenges core tenets of the IT governance canon, demonstrating that centralization–decentralization logic at the AI frontier must expand to account for the evolution of governance, process, and technological characteristics to realize effective AI governance.</content>

    <title>How Signals of Silence Sustain Sexual Harassment and What to Do About It</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sexual harassment has persisted for decades as an open secret within organizations, creating an ongoing challenge for Human Resource practitioners. Many employees experience or witness harassment yet say nothing. When they contemplate complaining, they are discouraged from doing so. Some still muster the courage to speak out about these abuses, but find their complaints ignored, downplayed, or dismissed by those in charge. Building on prior research, we propose that these practices add up to signals of silence, which we conceptualize and empirically operationalize. Drawing on social information processing theory, we explicate how these signals help sustain and perpetuate sexual harassment. We further argue that supervisors can counteract these harmful signals of silence by modeling ethical leadership. We investigated these ideas with two sets of studies comprising seven independent samples. In Study 1 (Ntotal= 2649 participants), Phases 1 through 5, we developed and validated a higher‐order aggregate measure of harassment signals of silence (Harassment SOS scale) comprising three interrelated elements: being silent, silencing others, and not listening. In Study 2 (Ntotal= 1111 participants), we used field samples collected from two North American police departments to test the relationship between signals of silence and experiences of harassment, along with the role of ethical supervision in mitigating the harmful effects of silence. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice, including the implementation of relevant HR policies and practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores the role of investors’ counterfactual thinking regarding errors of commission and omission and how these relate to willingness to invest in new ventures. Drawing from behavioral economics and psychology, we focus on the salience of prospective counterfactuals at the screening stage. Our experimental findings demonstrate that increasing the salience of commission-related counterfactuals, particularly social counterfactuals, significantly reduces investors’ willingness to invest. This effect underscores the influence of anticipated regret, social comparison, and emotional responses in shaping investment behavior. By contrast, omission-related counterfactuals show no measurable impact, suggesting a prevailing not-investing norm and limited effect of potential fear of missing out among new-venture investors. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how investors navigate the tension between avoiding missed opportunities and minimizing losses, emphasizing the salience of situational triggers as opposed to stable traits or market-wide factors. These insights highlight the importance of counterfactual thinking as a theoretical lens for studying decision-making in the high-risk, high-reward context of new-venture investing.</content>

    <title>Managerial actions using historical values for tackling hyper‐competitive environments: The case of Toyota</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides a causal explanation concerning how managerial actions using historical values contribute to dynamic capabilities, or sustaining competitive advantage in changing environments. Based on historical methods that consist mainly of hermeneutics, contextualization, and source criticism, it analyzes sources and data on how Toyota strategically responded to the competitive dynamics of the automotive industry centered around modularization. This resulted in the identification of three types of managerial action using historical values—filtering,integrating, andmodifying—which have a rhetorical influence on the processes of strategic diagnosis, choice, and action respectively in ways that strengthen the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. This enables the firm to adapt to hyper‐competitive environments while maintaining the idiosyncrasies of its core capabilities.Managerial SummaryToyota has sustained its competitive advantage for decades by consistently relying on its core capabilities, especially the Toyota Production System and its longstanding supplier relations. How has Toyota been able to do so while facing rapidly changing environments? This paper seeks to explore this question by comparing Toyota's and Nissan's strategies in response to modularization in the automotive industry in the 1990s and 2000s. It uncovers how a firm's managers can utilize historical values in ways that influence the processes of strategy formation and implementation. This allows the firm to incorporate key elements of new strategies that its rivals introduce in the marketplace alongside the firm's strategies based on its core capabilities, thereby adapting to hyper‐competitive environments while sustaining its idiosyncrasies and competitive advantage.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multiproduct Dynamic Pricing with Popularity Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Popularity bias, reflects the positive impact of popularity information on consumer choices. There are two common display formats for popularity information on online retail platforms: the total-based cumulative sales format, where the total sales of a product are displayed since its launch, and the period-based cumulative sales format, where only sales within a specific recent period are shown. Both types of popularity information are continuously updated. This paper focuses on the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem with popularity bias. We employ the widely used multinomial logit model (MNL) to investigate the impact of popularity bias on consumer choices. In particular, we examine how popularity bias affects marginal revenue, pricing decisions, and market shares. Moreover, we highlight that ignoring popularity bias can lead to a suboptimal outcome. As the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we propose a semi-myopic pricing policy, which is computationally tractable, and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality under both formats. Our numerical simulations further indicate that ignoring popularity bias can result in substantial revenue losses, while the semi-myopic pricing policy consistently outperforms other heuristics under both formats. Finally, empirical tests on real data provide a comprehensive procedure for identifying the most appropriate choice models, which offers practical insights for implementation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Revenue Management with Nonparametric Demand Learning and Product Returns</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product returns are prevalent in practice. Many retailers provide lenient free return policies but with specific return window within which customers are allowed to return products. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider a single-product online learning and pricing problem with stochastic product returns. A salient feature is that the demand function, depending on price and return window decisions, is initially unknown and must be learned on the fly. The retailer thus faces the classic exploration-exploitation trade-off. Moreover, we consider an inventory constraint, introducing an additional trade-off between earning revenue and managing inventory. We propose a modeling framework to integrate pricing and return window decisions, and develop a deterministic fluid model that serves as the full-information benchmark. To tackle the learning problem, we design a novel nonparametric learning algorithm that seamlessly integrates inverse stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods. Under mild assumptions on demand and revenue functions, we establish a regret upper bound for our learning algorithm asO(WTlogT), whereWdenotes the number of return window candidates andTdenotes the time horizon. This result aligns with lower bounds established in both online pricing and multi-armed bandit (MAB) literature. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm across various environments. From an operational standpoint, retailers can use our learning framework as a decision-support tool to identify the optimal price and return window.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Offline Learning and Optimization for Multi-product Inventory Management with Stockout-based Substitution</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We deal with a retailer’s multi-product inventory system where customers randomly seek acceptable substitutes if their initial requests are not satisfied. Unsuccessful quests for substitutes would result in lost sales. Motivated by a consulting project as well as other real practices, we also choose to deal with further challenges posed by initially unknown base demand distributions and substitution probabilities; moreover, we aim to develop an offline learning method that (i) takes advantage of given data derived from bygone decisions rather than of any learning-while-doing opportunity, (ii) makes inferences about base-demand distributions and pairwise substitution probabilities without knowing whether there have been demand arrivals after inventory depletions, and (iii) is unhindered by the lack of knowledge about the assortments faced by customers and their purchase-or-no-purchase decisions at their individual arrivals. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator that circumvents unrealistic data requirements. Our substitution probability estimates employ carefully designed weighting schemes to facilitate rigorous theoretical analysis through tools such as the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Both one-time substitution scenarios and more complex Markov-chain substitution patterns would be accommodated. Using large deviation tools, we establish provably optimal convergence rates of our estimates on top of consistency. The precision in parameter estimates would translate into accuracy in replenishment decisions. For inventory management, we take advantage of a submodularity property to obtain an exact algorithm for the two-product case and a good heuristic for the general multi-product problem. Computational studies based on simulated and actual data confirm the merits of our approach.</content>

    <title>Knowledge Behind Firewalls: How Rivalry Among Alliance Partners Constrains Innovation Inside Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations can gain substantial knowledge synergies from their alliance portfolios, and research suggests firms may benefit even more when their partners compete directly with each other. However, firms can only capture such synergies if their own inventors are allowed to freely exchange knowledge obtained from these partners to create novel combinations. We challenge this premise and argue that, because partners in such configurations are more concerned about the risks of knowledge leakage to their rivals, they will pressure the focal firm into imposing credible safeguards that restrict the access and handling of knowledge inside its organization. We predict that the constraints imposed by these safeguards will be reflected in a higher disconnectedness in the focal firm’s inventor collaboration network, with the extent of these constraints tied to the relative technological bargaining power the focal firm holds over its partners. Importantly, these safeguards are not costless, and we predict that the disconnectedness induced will affect the focal firm’s innovation performance by undermining its ability to create and appropriate inventive value. Using a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms, we find consistent support for these arguments. Our study contributes to research on interfirm alliances, intraorganizational networks, and innovation while offering practical insights for managers.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17230 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Loot Boxes to Better Design: Pricing Randomized ProductsRandomized rewards—often described as “mystery packs” or “blind-box” mechanics—are now a familiar feature in many video games. Yet choosing a loot box’s price and the odds of each possible drop is not just a design decision; it is a challenging optimization problem. In their accepted Operations Research paper, “Algorithms for loot box design” (Han, Ryan, and Tong, forthcoming), the authors develop an algorithmic framework for designing loot boxes by selecting a purchase price and item drop probabilities to maximize expected revenue under player choice behavior. They show that the general problem is computationally hard, but also identify economically motivated restrictions on player utilities that make the design problem tractable. When the number of items is fixed, the paper provides an exact polynomial-time algorithm under one class of utility structures and efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees under another. The analysis also links loot-box design to classic pricing ideas, offering guidance on how to translate item-level values and rarity into transparent, well-performing randomized reward systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using career history data from employees’ online profiles, we provide empirical evidence regarding how human resources systems can affect the gender gap in job tenure. Our results indicate that female workers experience shorter average job tenure than male workers. Our results further show that abandoning forced ranking systems helps to narrow this gender gap. We present experimental evidence indicating that in forced ranking environments, women experience shorter tenure than men and are more likely to exit their roles. This is true even when women are on equal footing with men. Finally, we present survey evidence that under forced ranking systems, more women resign as compared with men. In sum, our empirical, experimental, and survey results indicate that forced ranking systems may contribute to a gender gap in job tenure. Accordingly, abandoning such systems may help promote workplace gender equality.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72472068, 72422022, 72272055, 72321001, 72342009, 72325010, and 72172085], the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Chinese Ministry of Education [Grant 22JZD012], Shenzhen Natural Science Foundation [Grant JCYJ20250604144252069], and Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) Faculty Research Grant [Project No. FRG-25-013-MSB].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03264 .</content>

    <title>The Value of Flexibility from Opaque Selling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An opaque product refers to a subset of products that only differ in some secondary attribute (such as color or style). After a customer purchases an opaque product, one of the products in the subset is then allocated to the customer. Selling opaque products has become popular on e-commerce platforms, because it is a source of flexibility that reduces demand variability and hence inventory cost. In this paper, we seek to understand how the design of opaque product configurations and the fraction of customers choosing opaque products impact the value of flexibility arising from opaque selling. The key finding from our study is the following insight: A modest opaque selling strategy where (i) the opaque options contain small subsets and (ii) only a small fraction of customers buy opaque products achieves substantial cost savings (compared with nonopaque traditional selling). Moreover, the cost savings of this modest opaque strategy is on the same order as a fully flexible scenario where all customers buy an opaque product. Our analysis relies on exploring a novel connection of multiproduct inventory management to the balls-into-bins framework along with a simple balancing policy for opaque selling. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that the simple balancing policy is asymptotically optimal. For extensions outside of our theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that our core insights continue to hold.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 1944428].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2019.02983 .</content>

    <title>Joint Assortment and Inventory Planning Under the Markov Chain Choice Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We address the joint assortment and inventory optimization problem for an online retailer facing a set of N substitutable products. The retailer must determine both the assortment and inventories of these products before the start of the selling season to maximize the expected profit. We consider a setting with dynamic SOBS, where consumers’ choices follow the Markov chain choice model. This is a challenging problem, and even computing the expected profit for a given assortment and inventory solution requires solving an intractable dynamic program. We present a sample average approximation-based algorithm for the problem that achieves a regret of [Formula: see text] with respect to an linear program (LP) upper bound. Our algorithm first selects an assortment by balancing the expected revenue (from a single consumer) and the inventory cost. We do this by identifying a subset of products that can pool demand from the universe of substitutable products without significantly cannibalizing the revenue in the presence of dynamic substitution behavior of consumers. We then use a sample average approximation-based LP to decide on the inventory level for each item in the selected assortment. We numerically show that our algorithm considerably improves the performance over standard approaches from the literature on a wide range of instances of the Markov chain choice model and demonstrate that it carefully handles the inventory of products in the long tail (i.e., products with small mean total demand).This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by Amazon [Research Award (V.

    <title>Optimal Contests with Negative Prizes: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the optimal design of contests in the presence of negative prizes and establishes the optimality of a modified all-pay auction with entry fee and reserve. The entry fee always equals the contestants’ liability, and the reserve is weakly higher than in contests without negative prizes. The modification involves awarding all contestants a strictly positive prize if none meet the reserve. This optimal contest better incentivizes high-ability contestants by offering them a higher prize augmented by entry fees, while still ensuring full participation from low-ability contestants. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when contestants’ liability is sufficiently high, the same contest maximizes both the expected total effort and winner’s effort, with both measures increasing with liability. Numerical simulations show that even with low liability, predictions from the two optimal contests are closely aligned. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment comparing optimal contests across different liability levels, confirming the “killing-two-birds-with-one-stone” prediction.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UTS Business School Research Grant, UTS Behavioural Lab Grant and National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72192842, 72203099, 72422018].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03580 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of Online Cart Composition on Cart Abandonment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online shopping cart abandonment is widespread, causing major losses in potential revenues for e-commerce companies. We expand efforts to mitigate cart abandonment by investigating how the cart’s product composition affects abandonment and testing easy-to-implement interventions. We hypothesize that consumers are more likely to abandon carts containing a higher proportion of hedonic relative to utilitarian products. This cart composition effect arises because carts containing higher hedonic-to-utilitarian product ratios are perceived as more hedonic overall, increasing consumer guilt regarding cart purchase, and the likelihood of cart abandonment. Analyses of two large-scale field datasets and four controlled experiments provide converging evidence for the cart composition effect (Studies 1A-3) and the mediating role of perceived hedonism and consumer guilt (Studies 2, 4A, 4B). Substantively, we offer empirical support for a practical and easily implemented intervention: using e-commerce recommendation systems to reduce cart abandonment by suggesting utilitarian items (Studies 4A &amp; 4B). Our findings suggest that recommendation systems may serve as an effective tool for reducing cart abandonment and underscore the importance of incorporating hedonic value considerations into recommendation algorithms. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings for the development of more effective marketing strategies and improving online conversion rates.</content>

    <title>Partisan Cities: How State‐Local Political Alignment Shapes Credit Risk and Information Processing in the Municipal Bond Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how partisan alignment between city leaders and state governors shapes information processing and bond pricing in the municipal bond market. Using a novel data set on 1,045 U.S. cities from 2005 to 2019, we show that cities with the same political affiliation as the state governor face 9 basis points lower borrowing costs than misaligned cities. The effect is stronger for riskier bonds, in states where governors hold greater authority, and for fiscally dependent cities. Aligned cities also receive more aid during fiscal distress. Partisan alignment shapes how investors interpret and respond to financial information: Nondisclosure and adverse audit findings raise borrowing costs primarily for misaligned cities, while penalties for aligned cities are markedly smaller.</content>

    <title>Reactions by Actual Data Breach Victims over Time: Evidence from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica Breach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a data breach happens, both victims, whose data were breached, and nonvictims react negatively but not equally so. In this study, we used Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach to identify to what extent reactions of data breach victims go beyond those of nonvictims. Our findings reveal that victims initially lose more trust, feel more violated, feel more strongly that a psychological contract has been breached, feel less belonging on Facebook, and intend to continue using Facebook less. However, these effects are short-lived, disappearing within six months. Intuitively, one might assume that this is because people are locked in on Facebook and are forced to change their attitudes because they cannot change their behavior by leaving it. Surprisingly, a follow-up experiment shows that this is not the case as we found people who are less locked in to improve their attitudes more over time. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that consumers are unable to act when their data are breached and their privacy is violated and that regulation may be needed to better protect data. The short-lived nature of victims’ reactions we identified in this case also raises questions about the role of postbreach compensation in different contexts.</content>

    <title>The power of expressed humility: Early stage investors' reaction to humble entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how entrepreneur‐expressed humility affects early stage investors' willingness to fund new ventures. In pitching contexts where investors rely on relational cues and implicit prototypes of entrepreneurs, we theorize three distinct pathways through which expressed humility shapes funding decisions. First, building on research regarding interpersonal signals in early stage valuation, we propose that humility fosters perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, increasing investors' willingness to fund. Second, drawing on implicit leadership theories, we argue that humility may trigger negative perceptions regarding the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Across a videometric analysis of 140 real‐world pitches and a randomized experiment with French early stage investors, we show that expressed humility elicits both pathways, but investors prioritize positive attributions.Managerial SummaryAlthough humility is often regarded as a positive leadership trait, it contradicts implicit prototypes of successful entrepreneurs, who are typically seen as dominant and assertive. We examine how early stage investors perceive and respond to displays of humility during pitches. We propose that entrepreneur‐expressed humility produces ambiguous effects: It enhances perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, but raises doubts about the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Using a videometric analysis of 140 pitches from the French version ofShark Tankand a randomized experiment with venture capital investors, we find evidence for these competing pathways. Overall, investors prioritize the positive attributions of interpersonal skills, suggesting that entrepreneurs benefit from expressing humility when pitching.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper “Pre-hedging” studies a dealer that pre-hedges an anticipated potential trade and analyses how this affects the client’s overall execution outcome. It shows that pre-hedging can benefit both parties: Improved risk management over an extended horizon then enables the dealer to charge reduced spreads that more than offset any adverse impact the pre-hedging activity has on the execution price. However, when a dealer pre-hedges too aggressively, this can be detrimental to the client. Timing uncertainty of the potential trade is an effective control held by the client to mitigate any counterproductive pre-hedging. Our results are robust to a setting where competing dealers simultaneously pre-hedge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multiasset Optimal Execution via Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic ControlIn “Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic Optimal Control Without Explicit Solution,” Dupret and Hainaut introduce the generalized policy iteration physics-informed neural network, a novel deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems even when the optimal control does not admit explicit solution. The method combines physics-informed neural networks with an actor-critic structure based on generalized policy iteration and uses separate networks to approximate both the value function and the multidimensional optimal control. This approach provides a global approximation of the solution across time and space, enabling fast online evaluation. Theoretical guarantees on convergence and optimality are provided, whereas its accuracy and efficacy are empirically validated through two important numerical examples from operations research. Thereby, the authors generalize the Almgren–Chriss framework arising from optimal execution in finance by allowing both temporary and permanent price impacts to be fully nonlinear and by considering a multidimensional setting with multiple cointegrated assets.</content>

    <title>Trustworthiness in Computational Theory Construction: Dimensionalization and Category Surfacing1</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this methods article, we unpack how researchers can foster trustworthiness in dimensionalization and category surfacing (DCS), a key method family within the genre of computational theory construction (CTC). Information systems (IS), management, and organizational scholars are increasingly leveraging DCS tools such as topic modeling, word embeddings, and clustering to surface latent categories and dimensions from textual data for theory construction. Yet they struggle because evaluations of such research often default to transparency, operationalized as replicability and accountability, which obscures the analytical choices that actually make DCS research rigorous. In this study, we recast transparency as a means toward trustworthiness. We treat researchers’ analytical moves as the primary unit of methodological reasoning in how they design, conduct, and disclose their choices across research phases. We develop a framework that authors, reviewers, and editors can use to construct and evaluate DCS research. The framework specifies how trustworthiness arises from the interplay of two research design choices: primacy to theoretical versus practice lexicons, and whether the content of texts or the structure of the corpus carries the theoretical load. We articulate expectations for conduct and disclosure across these design choices, clarifying how proportionate reasoning anchors trustworthiness. We conclude with implications for advancing trustworthiness within the broader CTC community and across other computational approaches to research.</content>

    <title>Network‐Enabled Responses to Deglobalization: Examining How Firms Strategize During Eras of Global Disruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research has shown how cycles of globalization and deglobalization can disrupt firms and networks. Understanding this process requires a historical perspective on how firms and networks coordinate, strategize, and respond to the effects of deglobalization. This paper examines firm‐level, network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization by analysing a selection of key firms operating within the Liverpool (UK) and New York (USA) networks at the turn of the nineteenth century. The case study analyses firms within a broader network structure through network visualization, supplemented by various archival data sources. We explore the strategic responses of multiple firms and demonstrate how the network supported them, enabling them to address the challenges posed by deglobalization. We identify five categories of network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization: reinforcement, adaptation, shared risk, lobbying, and exit.</content>

    <title>Content Exclusivity on Advertising Revenue–Sharing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch rely on third-party providers and share advertising revenue to incentivize content production. Yet, as providers increasingly distribute content across multiple platforms, competition intensifies and platforms consider exclusive contracts to restrict providers’ multihoming behavior. Our research develops an analytical model to examine when exclusive contracts benefit or harm platforms, providers, consumers, and overall welfare. We find that exclusivity has two key forces: it limits the number of providers on each platform, reducing same-side crowding, but it also weakens the effectiveness of revenue sharing as a competitive tool for attracting providers. As a result, exclusivity benefits platforms only when consumers place low marginal value on content, leading platforms to offer lower sharing rates and earn higher profits. When consumer valuation is high, exclusivity can backfire, reducing platform profits. Importantly, exclusivity can increase provider surplus and even generate win–win outcomes for both platforms and providers at intermediate valuation levels. Although exclusivity reduces consumer surplus because of fewer providers, total social welfare may still increase because of reduced competition costs among providers. These findings suggest policymakers should take a nuanced stance toward regulating content exclusivity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the challenge of assortment planning in the context of quick commerce, a rapidly growing business model that aims to deliver time-sensitive products. In order to achieve quick delivery to satisfy the immediate demands of online customers in close proximity, personalized online assortments need to be included in brick-and-mortar store offerings. With the presence of this physical linkage requirement and distinct multinomial logit choice models for online consumer segments, the firm seeks to maximize overall revenue by selecting an optimal assortment of products for local stores and by tailoring a personalized assortment for each online consumer segment. We employ an integer programming approach to solve this NP-hard problem to global optimality. In particular, we derive convex hull results to represent the consumer choice of each online segment under a general class of operational constraints, and to characterize the relation between assortment decisions and choice probabilities of products. Our convex hull results, coupled with a modified choice probability–ordered separation algorithm, yield formulations that provide a significant computational advantage over existing methods. Finally, we illustrate how our convex hull results can be used to address other assortment optimization problems.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ad fraud is increasingly becoming a major concern in online advertising, with publishers being one of the key sources of fraudulent ad traffic. Although ad fraud deterrence is a critical problem from both technical and economic perspectives, past research has not considered their interplay. Our paper fills this critical gap by building a game-theoretic model wherein an ad network (an intermediary between publishers and advertisers) strategically leverages its technological tool (the configuration of a given fraud detection technology) and economic tool (the payment to publishers) to deter ad fraud and maximize profits effectively. Our analysis generates several interesting findings. For example, as the fraud detection technology and fraud generation techniques improve, we show that although the ad network needs to respond by making the technology configuration stricter to dampen fraud motives and admit less ad traffic, it may sometimes need to increase the payment. Furthermore, although many stakeholders advocate instituting strict legislation and policies to reduce malicious publishers, we show that this may sometimes fail to reduce fraud traffic and even hurt an ad network’s profit. In addition, our results provide other useful implications that present a new theoretical perspective on the incentive problems in ad fraud generation and detection. Our study also draws valuable insights for ad networks into implementing effective ad fraud deterrence policies and for advertisers to audit and monitor their ad campaign performance.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: S.

    <title>Matchmaking Strategies for Maximizing Player Engagement in Video Games</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing player engagement is vital to the online gaming industry, given that many games generate revenue through subscription models and microtransactions. We scrutinize engagement management in the prevalent category of competitive video games, where players are frequently matched against one another, and matchmaking systems substantially impact engagement. We propose a dynamic model to analyze player dynamics and optimize matchmaking policies for maximum engagement. Our model takes into account two essential factors in competitive games: heterogeneous skill levels and players’ aversion to losing. Additionally, the model enables us to consider pay-to-win strategies and AI-powered bots, which are contentious methods of influencing player engagement and endogenously affect the optimal matchmaking policy. To provide sharp insights, we analyze a specific case where there are two skill levels, and players churn only after experiencing a losing streak. The optimal matchmaking policy considers both short-term rewards by matching players myopically and long-term rewards by adjusting skill distribution. The pay-to-win system can positively impact player engagement when the majority of players are low-skilled, because adopting pay-to-win also affects skill distribution. This result challenges the conventional wisdom that typically regards pay-to-win as trading player experience for revenue. When incorporating AI-powered bots, we demonstrate that optimizing the matchmaking policy can significantly reduce the number of required bots. We then extend our model and conduct a case study with real data from an online chess platform. The optimal policy can improve engagement by 4%–6% or reduce the percentage of bots by 3% in comparison with skill-based matchmaking.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: A.

    <title>Multidimensional Signaling with Supplier Credit Guarantees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates credit guarantees in a supply chain setting involving a supplier, a capital-constrained buyer, and a bank. We find that under complete information, credit guarantees increase order quantities but paradoxically raise wholesale prices, overall rendering the credit guarantee not useful for improving the operational efficiency. However, under information asymmetry, either a partial or full guarantee emerges in equilibrium, with the wholesale price maintained at its optimal full-information level. This underscores the pivotal role of credit guarantees in effective signaling and delineates the distinct functions of the wholesale price and the guarantee—the former on operational efficiency and the latter on signaling efficacy. Further comparative analysis of the supplier and buyer performances under the two contract types reveals that credit guarantees do not always benefit both parties.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Antitrust laws mandate review of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) that exceed an asset size threshold based on accounting standards that exclude most intangible capital. We show that this exclusion leads to thousands of intangible‐intensive M&amp;As being nonreportable. Acquirers in nonreportable deals achieve higher equity values and price markups, especially when consolidating product markets. Furthermore, nonreportable pharmaceutical deals are three times more likely to involve overlapping drug projects, which are subsequently 40% more likely to be terminated. Our results suggest that the growth of intangible assets may exacerbate market power through nonreportable consolidation of the sectors most concerning for consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers struggle to match recommendations to why customers buy. We introduce a practical framework that distinguishes two core, actionable purchase motivations, stable preference and exploratory intent, and present STB, a data-efficient measure that infers which motivation drives each item purchase using only transaction sequences and item attributes. Building on STB, we develop UPSTAR, a motivation-aware recommender that separates users’ behavior into stable-preference and exploratory subsequences and fuses their signals for next-item prediction. Across three real-world e-commerce data sets, UPSTAR substantially improves accuracy and, importantly, advances the system’s ability to surface genuinely exploratory items that drive discovery and cross-category sales. For practitioners, our method enables more targeted marketing: promote reliable items to preference-driven buyers while exposing exploratory buyers to curated novelty, improving conversion and long-term engagement. For platform policy and operations, motivation-aware recommendations support inventory planning, personalized promotions, and responsible diversification of exposure without requiring surveys or extensive auxiliary data. Implementation requires only existing transaction logs and item metadata, making it immediately deployable for large-scale retail systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employee retention, motivation, performance, and well‐being remain enduring priorities in human resource management, yet existing constructs such as engagement, commitment, and satisfaction do not fully capture the depth of emotional attachment that some employees feel towards their jobs. We introduce Love of the Job (LOJ) as a higher‐order form of affective attachment to one's job that integrates passion for one's work, non‐romantic intimacy with coworkers, and commitment to organizational membership, grounded in Sternberg's triangular theory of love. Across a four‐stage, eight‐sample program of research (totalN= 1,801), we develop and validate a concise and reliable LOJ scale using diverse working‐adult samples and longitudinal designs. The measure demonstrates strong psychometric properties and discriminant validity from related constructs, establishing LOJ as a distinct form of work attachment, and shows incremental predictive validity for key outcomes, including discretionary performance, innovation, and job crafting, as well as retention and well‐being indicators such as turnover intentions, partial absenteeism, and work neglect. Together, these findings position LOJ as a novel, theoretically grounded construct with strategic relevance for HRM and provide scholars and practitioners with a robust tool to assess and better understand employees' deep emotional attachment to their work.</content>

    <title>Platform competition and strategic trade‐offs for complementors: Heterogeneous reactions to the entry of a new platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the entry of a rival platform affects the strategies of the incumbent's complementors. The latter face a trade‐off: While the entry threatens their benefits from indirect network effects, it also allows them to escape intense within‐platform competition. Studying Epic Games' entry into the PC video game market—until then dominated by Steam—we show that this trade‐off does not resolve uniformly, driving heterogeneity in strategic reactions. Complementors with weaker strategic resources (independent developers) were more likely to multihome and became less responsive to the incumbent's attempts to orchestrate collective action through platform‐wide sales promotions. In contrast, complementors more reliant on indirect network effects (multiplayer developers) were less likely to multihome and became more responsive to orchestration attempts.Managerial SummaryAs competition between digital platforms intensifies, complementors—firms that provide complementary products or services—must adjust how they engage with platform owners. The entry of a rival platform creates both opportunities and risks: it offers an alternative with less intense competition but also fragments the user base that underpins network benefits. We find that these opposing effects shape complementors' behavior differently. Those with fewer strategic resources are more likely to join the new platform and become less willing to follow the incumbent's coordinated initiatives. In contrast, complementors whose products rely strongly on network effects tend to remain with the incumbent and cooperate more closely with its orchestration efforts. For managers, this highlights that platform competition not only shifts market dynamics but also reshapes the motivations and strategies of heterogeneous complementors.</content>

    <title>When Overconfident CEOs Deliver Higher Returns: Evidence From Acquisition Waves</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfident CEOs are frequently criticized for making value-destroying corporate acquisitions in which they acquire excessively and overpay for their acquisitions. By contrast, we argue that overconfident CEOs can deliver higher returns in acquisition waves because the motivation and the requirement for action speed that occur in acquisition waves are different from other acquisition contexts. Specifically, we hypothesize and find that overconfident CEOs are more likely to capture preemption opportunities by acting earlier in acquisition waves, and such rapid moves enable overconfident CEOs to achieve higher acquisition returns. In addition, drawing upon organizational learning research, we hypothesize and find that in acquisition waves, pre-wave experience with large and related acquisitions facilitates overconfident CEOs to pursue acquisitions even more quickly during acquisition waves, which further enhances acquisition returns. Contributions to the acquisitions and CEO overconfidence literatures are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Green finance—including environmental, social, and governance investing and sustainable finance regulations—is widespread, but can it substitute for carbon pricing in fighting climate change? In a unified model, I show that (i) when carbon prices reflect the social cost of carbon, green finance should not be used; (ii) when carbon prices are too low, green finance can implement the social optimum if each firm's cost of capital can be set to itssustainable discount rate, which increases with the ratio of carbon emissions to firm value. I provide calibrations, analyze stranded assets, and present implementations through subsidies or preferential financing for green firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine Twitter discussion of sell-side analysts’ stock recommendation revisions. While many investors lack direct access to analyst research, we observe revision-related Twitter discussion associated with approximately 90 percent of the revisions in our sample, usually within three hours of their announcement. Revision-related Twitter discussion is greater for upgrades and for analysts from larger brokerages. Examining within-revision intraday price discovery, we observe increased price discovery during intraday windows with more revision-related tweets, especially for tweets that have more user engagement, are posted by more influential authors, or involve stocks with more intense retail trading volume. We find that revision-related retail trading is more intense and better predicts future returns for revisions with more revision-related Twitter discussion. We observe no such evidence for institutional investors who have direct access to sell-side research. Our results suggest that Twitter is an important channel in facilitating price discovery following analyst revisions, particularly among retail investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Big Data to Real-Time Decisions: Online Tensor InferenceModern digital platforms, from e-commerce and online advertising to mobile health, generate massive streams of high-dimensional data that must be analyzed in real time. In their paper “Online Tensor Inference,” Xin Wen, Will Wei Sun, and Yichen Zhang develop a new statistical framework that enables both efficient learning and rigorous inference for streaming tensor data. The authors propose an online low-rank tensor estimation method based on stochastic gradient descent that processes observations sequentially without storing historical data, overcoming the memory and scalability limitations of traditional offline approaches. Beyond estimation, the paper introduces a novel online debiasing technique that delivers valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests on the fly without data splitting. Theoretical results establish near-minimax-optimal convergence rates and asymptotic normality for general linear functionals of tensors. Together, these advances provide a principled foundation for real-time, statistically grounded decision making in fast-changing, data-rich environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of working from home (WFH) practices on the financial services industry, focusing on sell-side equity analysts. We find that analysts who previously benefited from access to in-person interactions with other informed parties experience a greater decline in earnings forecast accuracy following the COVID lockdown and the shift to WFH. Notably, the informational advantage associated with the in-person access disappears during the lockdown and returns once restrictions are lifted. Our results are stronger for all-star analysts and analysts with shorter coverage periods, suggesting that all-star analysts rely relatively more on access to in-person interactions prelockdown and that accumulated firm-specific knowledge mitigates the loss of in-person interactions. Our results remain robust across alternative analyst performance measures. We conclude that, despite recent advances in communications technology, AI, and machine learning, in-person interactions remain a unique and difficult to substitute information channel for sell-side research providers and that WFH impedes information flows between market participants in capital markets.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04637 .</content>

    <title>Calling It Quits: A Behavioral Perspective on Exploration and Exploitation in R&amp;amp;D Project Termination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not every R&amp;D project will succeed, necessitating a careful selection of which R&amp;D projects to pursue and which to terminate. Timely termination decisions free up scarce resources for more promising projects. Yet, prior research has yielded inconclusive results on how firms terminate exploratory versus exploitative R&amp;D projects. Given that early‐stage R&amp;D project termination is a decision made under high uncertainty, we adopt a behavioral perspective to reconcile the inconsistent findings. We propose that a firm's preference for terminating exploratory versus exploitative projects depends on three sources of contextual feedback: parallel projects, prior collaboration experience, and firm performance. We test our hypotheses using drug development projects from pharmaceutical firms over 11 years, finding that exploratory projects are less likely to be terminated relative to exploitative ones when the number of parallel projects is limited, when they are conducted with an existing partner, or when firm performance falls below aspiration.</content>

    <title>Human-Algorithm Collaboration in Gig Work: The Role of Experience, Skill Level, and Task Complexity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we contribute to recent studies on human-algorithm collaboration by examining how experience, skill level, workload, and task complexity shape the impact of an algorithm-enabled decision-support tool for gig workers. We leverage a large-scale randomized field experiment on the Instacart platform from June 2022 to September 2022. The algorithm-enabled technology aims to revolutionize item picking by helping shoppers locate and collect items more efficiently, reducing picking time while maintaining service quality, as reflected by refund rates. We find that the technology complements experience: rather than diminishing the value of experience, it yields larger improvements for more experienced shoppers. We also find that it substitutes for skill levels by helping lower-skilled workers bridge the performance gap with higher-skilled peers, but lower-skilled workers need experience to fully benefit from the tool. Finally, treatment effects vary with workload and task complexity, clarifying when algorithmic guidance is most valuable. For policymakers, our findings suggest a simple rule: give workers some baseline experience before introducing AI tools, using a staggered rollout with basic training. We also show that these tools can make service more consistent by closing the gap between high performers and lower performers, reducing performance dispersion, and helping standardize quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the increasing application of digital technology in management practices, its implications for employee involvement and high involvement work systems (HIWSs) remain largely unexplored. Based on an in‐depth qualitative case study of Tencent—one of China's largest information technology companies—this article explores whether and in what ways employee experience (EX)‐oriented digital HRM contributes to the development of HIWSs. Drawing on socio‐technical systems theory, we examine the goals, tasks, structures, actors, and technical elements of the digital HRM system in the case company, as well as the interactions among these elements. Our findings suggest that the EX‐oriented digital HRM system enhances two key dimensions of HIWSs: technological empowerment and organizational involvement. First, EX‐oriented digital HRM provides employees with digital tools that enable them to exercise some autonomy in various facets of their work life. This includes self‐management, team collaboration, and personalized learning and development opportunities. Second, EX‐oriented digital HRM arguably promotes employee involvement in both product development and some aspects of organizational management by leveraging user experience design. This study contributes to the theory of socio‐technical systems and the literature on HIWSs in the digital era.</content>
