    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Businesses across industries, such as food delivery apps and GPS navigation systems, routinely provide customers with time estimates in inherently uncertain contexts. How does the format of these time estimates affect customers’ satisfaction? In particular, should companies provide customers with a point estimate representing the best estimate, or should they communicate the inherent uncertainty in outcomes by providing a range estimate? In eight preregistered experiments (N = 5,323), participants observed time estimates provided by an app, and we manipulated whether the app presented the time estimates as a point estimate (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 45 minutes.”) or a range (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 40–50 minutes.”). After participants learned about the app’s prediction performance by sampling a set of past outcomes, we measured participants’ evaluation of the app. We find that participants judged the app more positively when it provided a range rather than a point estimate. These results held across different domains, different time durations, different underlying outcome distributions, and an incentive-compatible design. We also find that this preference is not simply due to people’s dislike of late outcomes, as participants also rated ranges more positively than conservative point estimates corresponding to the upper (i.e., later) bound of the range. These findings suggest that companies can increase customer satisfaction with realized time estimates by communicating the uncertainty inherent in these time estimates.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was supported by the Bakar Faculty Fellowship at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley and the Beatrice Foods Co.

    <title>Using Subsidies, Fines, and Restitution with Budget Balance to Combat Digital Piracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite utilizing technical prevention methods and enacting copyright protection legislation, digital piracy has remained a persistent problem. We examine policy remedies to digital piracy whereby the policymaker has to balance its budget between fines on detected pirates, subsidies for legal purchases, and restitution to the firm. In our model, users choose whether to subscribe, copy, or not use the good, a firm decides on subscription fee and quality, and a policymaker determines subsidies, fines, and restitution. We find that the firm’s subscription fee is always increasing in subsidies, fines, and restitution under a budget balance constraint. The impact of these policy instruments on the firm’s investment in quality depends on how user marginal utility is influenced by the quality of the good and how the policymaker redistributes fines back to society, if at all. Using two specific functional forms with additive and multiplicative utility, we explain how these factors come into play. With additive utility, fines increase the firm’s investment in quality. However, with multiplicative utility the firm’s investment in quality decreases with fines if fines are used alone or alongside subsidies. In contrast to prior research, findings of our general framework illustrate that imposing fines on detected pirates “can” be socially optimal when accounting for the policymaker’s budget balance. Our specific functional forms also serve as two instances where imposing fines is always welfare maximizing. Finally, we find that although the policymaker’s optimal intervention improves social welfare and mitigates digital piracy, it leads to a reduction in consumer surplus.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2016-0431].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03463 .</content>

    <title>Economies Before Scale: I.T. Strategy and Performance Dynamics of Young U.S. Businesses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how dimensions of information technology (IT) strategy affect the performance of young businesses, as well as dynamics as they age. Drawing from lifecycle theory and firm boundary research, we derive the relationship between age-based performance differences and IT sourcing decisions. We highlight the dynamic tension between outsourcing’s support for accessing frontier inputs in the short term and ownership’s advantages for developing organization-specific resources and capabilities over time. Leveraging a large panel of Census Bureau microdata from 2006 to 2014, we provide the first systematic evidence that young manufacturing establishments (both startups and new units of existing firms) disproportionately benefit from modern IT outsourcing (ITO). The young also enjoy productivity benefits from owned IT capital (ITK), despite high uncertainty, smaller operational scale, and less complementary organizational capital. Although these returns appear commensurate with those of older producers, they are conditional on survival, which is improved by ITO but harmed by ITK accumulation. Combining flexibility-related gains from ITK with vintage-related advantages in early ITK investment, the young are revealed to have significantly greater IT productivity than older incumbents. A large battery of tests supports a causal interpretation, as well as mechanisms rooted in mitigating the effects of uncertainty (as opposed to size- or cost-related reasons). These findings illuminate an often-overlooked pattern of young-business dynamism relevant to economic trends and management practices in an increasingly digital age.This paper was accepted by DJ Wu, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the Stanford Digital Economy Lab.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2019.03116 .</content>

    <title>Investor Perceptions of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how the level of detail in legal regulations impacts crowdfunding. We find that clear, explicit regulations significantly boost crowdfunding volumes in a global sample of digital finance. Using proxies to measure regulatory detail in three types of countries—countries that sometimes, always, or never had regulation—in a series of difference-in-difference regressions, we show a significant positive relation between regulatory clarity and the level of debt crowdfunding. There is little effect on the level of equity crowdfunding. Clear regulations appear to encourage the creation of new crowdfunding platforms rather than concentrating activity in existing ones.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01538 .</content>

    <title>Optimizing Initial Screening for Colorectal Cancer Detection with Adherence Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two-stage screening programs for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection typically involve a first-stage test that evaluates fecal-hemoglobin (f-Hb) concentration in stool samples, with positive results leading to a recommended second-stage diagnostic test (colonoscopy). We explore the design of the first-stage test—specifically the selection of f-Hb cutoffs to report test outcomes—to balance screening effectiveness (CRC and polyp detection) and efficiency (colonoscopy costs), considering that not all individuals follow up with a colonoscopy. We propose an information design model that integrates Bayesian persuasion with information avoidance to address this issue. The model is applied to the design of Singapore’s CRC screening program and calibrated using data from multiple sources, including a nationwide survey of 3,920 respondents in Singapore. Our findings indicate that under certain conditions, using a single cutoff maximizes follow-up adherence, whereas showing exact f-Hb readings optimizes detection effectiveness. Raising the cutoff to 39 [Formula: see text], as compared with the current practice, could detect 21% more CRC and polyp cases, reduce colonoscopies by 27%, and lower lifetime CRC risk by 11%. This adjustment would reduce public healthcare expenditure by S$20 million and individual spending by S$12 million on average in screening costs. Choosing appropriate cutoffs for the first-stage test can significantly enhance the screening effectiveness while efficiently managing colonoscopy demands. The prevalent practice of using lower cutoffs to achieve high sensitivity may lead to excessive unnecessary colonoscopies and reduced follow-up adherence.This paper was accepted by Scholtes Stefan, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Ministry of Education - Singapore [Grant 18-C207-SMU-011].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01319 .</content>

    <title>Segment Profit/Loss and the Limitations of a “Management Approach”</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;GAAP’s “Management Approach” to segment reporting (ASC 280) requires firms to report segment profit/loss as the measure managers use when allocating resources internally across segments under the assumption that investors benefit from viewing segment performance through the eyes of management. We examine how segment performance measurement aligns with the way that investors use segment profit/loss measures externally. We first survey professional investors and find that they primarily use segment profit/loss to assess firm value and therefore desire measures focused on persistent income items that help predict future performance. Next, for a sample of public multi-segment firms from 2003 to 2018, we hand-collect details on the construction of firms’ segment profit/loss measures and compare them to the same firms’ valuation-focused measures (i.e., non-GAAP earnings and non-GAAP segment profit/loss). Relative to non-GAAP measures, ASC 280 segment profit/loss is significantly more likely to include less persistent items (e.g., restructuring charges) and exclude more persistent items (e.g., interest expense). ASC 280 segment profit/loss is also less predictive of future performance and less value relevant than non-GAAP measures. These differences are attributable to ASC 280 yielding segment profit/loss measures that focus on the controllability of items by segment managers instead of items’ persistence. Overall, ASC 280’s segment profit/loss exhibits misalignment between its internal use by managers (i.e., internal resource allocation) and its primary external use by investors (i.e., valuation), which limits its usefulness for investors. Our study informs market participants and standard setters considering the usefulness of segment disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01224 .</content>

    <title>Subcoalition Cluster Analysis: A New Method for Modeling Conflict in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The renewed interest among managers and management researchers in stakeholder governance has also underscored the shortage of quantitative methods available for studying business firms as political systems. A critical problem for researchers applying coalition-based theories of organizational politics to observational data is that the units of analysis, coined “subcoalitions,” are often unobservable. This paper introduces subcoalition cluster analysis (SCA) as a new computational framework for analyzing intrafirm conflict that permits researchers to model groups of heterogeneous actors in terms of a smaller set of representative subcoalitions. The SCA approach to identifying latent fault-lines among groups of actors is based on widely held ideas in management research about the structure of intrafirm coalition politics, is computationally practicable in settings with many alternatives or actors, and can be straightforwardly applied to observational settings with incomplete data on actor preferences. We then apply SCA to two cases in which an organization characterized by multiple, partially inconsistent goals and stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences face a politically contested decision. In both cases, we first analyze preference data using SCA to identify the subcoalition structure that best characterizes the set of actors in the organization. We then use the SCA output as a dependent variable in an analysis of the predictors of subcoalition membership in the first case and as an independent variable in an analysis of the changing patterns of social influence in the second.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.00013 .</content>

    <title>The Crowdfunding Effects on Venture Capital Investment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of crowdfunding on venture capital (VC) investments in the presence of competition among VC firms. Our economic model comprises a startup, a crowdfunding platform, and two VC firms, each with its own perception of the startup’s potential. The startup seeks equity funding from the VC firms and decides on the size of its equity offer. If the VC firms decline to invest, the startup pivots to crowdfunding. Following the crowdfunding campaign, all firms update their beliefs about the startup’s likelihood of success based on the crowdfunding outcome, prompting the VC firms to revisit their investment decisions, now with a reduced equity offer if the crowdfunding outcome was positive. This study provides theoretical underpinnings at the firm level for the observed aggregate-level empirical relationships, both positive and negative, between crowdfunding and VC investments. Specifically, based on our model, the positive relationship, where increased crowdfunding activity leads to a rise in subsequent VC investments, is attributed to startups that fail to secure VC funding in the absence of a crowdfunding platform but succeed in attracting VC attention after a successful crowdfunding campaign. In contrast, the negative relationship is attributed to highly valued startups that could have secured VC funding without crowdfunding, but with crowdfunding, VC firms choose to defer their investment decision until after the crowdfunding campaign’s result is known; on the one hand, a successful crowdfunding outcome lowers their post-crowdfunding VC investment demand, and on the other hand, an unsuccessful outcome deters potential VC investors. Besides these relationships, we also identify another dynamic, where the option of accessing crowdfunding raises VC investment, even if the startup does not actually launch a crowdfunding campaign.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grants RGPIN-2015-06757 and RGPIN-2021-04295] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 71901135].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00994 .</content>

    <title>Diversification Quotients: Quantifying Diversification via Risk Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish the first axiomatic theory for diversification indices using six intuitive axioms: nonnegativity, location invariance, scale invariance, rationality, normalization, and continuity. The unique class of indices satisfying these axioms, called the diversification quotients (DQs), are defined based on a parametric family of risk measures. A further axiom of portfolio convexity pins down DQs based on coherent risk measures. The DQ has many attractive properties, and it can address several theoretical and practical limitations of existing indices. In particular, for the popular risk measures value at risk and expected shortfall, the corresponding DQ admits simple formulas, and it is efficient to optimize in portfolio selection. Moreover, it can properly capture tail heaviness and common shocks, which are neglected by traditional diversification indices. When illustrated with financial data, the DQ is intuitive to interpret, and its performance is competitive against other diversification indices.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a widely observed yet theoretically underexplored sales tactic: the limited time offer. By focusing on price-directed search markets, we offer a novel perspective on the application of limited time offers by firms and their implications for social welfare. We build a search model where firms advertise dynamic pricing to influence a consumer’s search order. Across various model settings, we demonstrate that limited time offers serve as the most effective pricing tool for firms to achieve search prominence or implement search discrimination, with their impact on social welfare varying depending on the market context. In particular, although existing literature suggests that limited time offers are anticompetitive in markets where prices are unobservable presearch, our findings show that, in markets with observable prices, limited time offers can enhance social efficiency in certain cases by facilitating a socially optimal search order.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: Z.

    <title>Tracking Truth with Liquid Democracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dynamics of random transitive delegations on a graph are of particular interest when viewed through the lens of an emerging voting paradigm: liquid democracy. This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations that they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing that they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of N = 168 participants, 62 delegation graphs, and over 11,000 votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, market design, platform, and demand analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Michael Hammer Fellowship, the Office of Naval Research [2016 Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, 2020 ONR Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and Grant N00014-20-1-2488], the Office of Secretary of Defense [Grants ARO MURI W911NF-19-0217 and ARO W911NF-17-1-0592], Simons [Investigator Award 622132], the Open Philanthropy Foundation, and the National Science Foundation [Grants IIS-178108, CCF-1733556, CCF-1918421, CCF-2007080, IIS-1703846, and IIS-2024287].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of the expansion of the U.S. Postal Service in the late 19th century on firm creation and performance. Utilizing newly digitized archival data on historic business establishments, post office locations, and road networks in California, our study identifies a positive relationship between the expansion of the Postal Service and the emergence of new firms. To address endogeneity concerns, we leverage an unexpected change in the Postal Service route network. Our findings suggest that the Postal Service played a significant role in facilitating firm entry by acting as a carrier of specialized knowledge rather than as a financial service or mass communication infrastructure. We further reveal that, although increased competition from new entrants generally exerted downward pressure on incumbent firms, those relying on specialized knowledge and public technology inputs significantly benefited from local Postal Service access. Taken together, our study underscores the critical role played by the Postal Service in knowledge diffusion and local economic development by enabling the sourcing of specialized knowledge and technologies from other geographies. Overall, our results contribute to a broader understanding of how communication and knowledge dissemination infrastructure can drive entrepreneurship and firm growth, carrying important implications for contemporary discussions on infrastructure development, its potential to stimulate entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and foster local economic communities.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03369 .</content>

    <title>Optimal Match Recommendations in Two-sided Marketplaces with Endogenous Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many two-sided marketplaces rely on match recommendations to help customers find suitable service providers at suitable prices. This paper develops a tractable methodology that a platform can use to optimize its match recommendation policy to maximize the total value generated by the platform while accounting for the endogeneity of transaction prices, which are set by the providers based on supply and demand and can depend on the platform’s match recommendation policy. Despite the complications of price endogeneity, an optimal match recommendation policy has a simple structure and can be computed efficiently. In particular, an optimal policy always recommends the providers who deliver the highest conversion rates. Moreover, an optimal policy can be encoded simply in terms of the frequency of recommending each provider to each customer segment, without the need to encode which subsets of providers are to be recommended together. On the other hand, if the platform were to optimize its match recommendations without accounting for price endogeneity, then the resultant policy would be more complex, and the market is likely to get stuck at a strictly suboptimal outcome, even if the platform were to continually reoptimize its match recommendations after prices re-equilibrate.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02691 .</content>

    <title>Timing Complex News to Target Attention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investors have limited and time-varying attention. These constraints are heterogeneous across investors, which can create asymmetric information and adverse selection problems. We show how firms take these constraints into account: They release harder-to-process news in periods when investor attention is higher. We use an institutional discontinuity within the U.S. corporate filing system to measure these effects. Filings before 5:30 p.m. become available immediately, whereas filings after 5:30 p.m. only become visible the next morning and attract less attention. Firms release longer and more complex news just before the cutoff, giving investors the longest possible period to absorb the information before markets open. Firms experience faster price convergence and more liquidity after precutoff news despite their complexity, which is consistent with the additional attention that they attract. We outline a framework in which the need for investors to spread their attention across different ideas induces firms to file their more complex filings at times when investor attention is higher. Our results are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors pay more attention to complex news and in which firms with complex news time them to target investor attention.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03722 .</content>

    <title>Relational Resonance and Content Creation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how tie formation shapes the production of user-generated content on social media, offering insights into enhancing user engagement and alleviating social media fatigue. We conceptualize tie formation as a relationship codevelopment process involving a tie initiator and a respondent. Drawing on social psychology literature, we propose a framework that traces how initiators’ social cognition evolves throughout this process—from proactively extending an inviting social tie to receiving a responsive one in return. Central to our framework is a perceptual mechanism we term relational resonance, which fosters intrinsic motivation and prompts initiators to adjust their content creation. Using data from YouTube, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify individual creators’ content adjustments, measured by changes in video volume and viewer engagement. Our results reveal that while initiators tend to reduce content production after receiving a responsive tie, the videos they create generate higher engagement, with “like” and “subscribe” rates increasing by 1.1 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. Remarkably, the receipt of a responsive tie leads to average weekly increases of 66 likes and 183 subscriptions even after accounting for the decrease in video volume, reinforcing the “quality over quantity” principle in content creation strategies. An online experiment further elucidates the mechanism underlying the observed adjustment behavior, providing robust validation for our proposed framework. Implications for research and practice are discussed.This paper was accepted by D.J. Wu, information systems.Funding: T.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variation in functional expertise is an important decision that managers face when designing teams tasked with being creative. We develop theory that predicts that functional diversity has countervailing effects on team creativity through its positive (negative) effect on the uniqueness (usefulness) of the proposals generated. We conduct an experiment where functionally homogeneous or heterogeneous two-person teams are tasked with proposing a creative use for an unused university space. We measure the uniqueness, usefulness, and overall creativity of team proposals. We also use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging technology to investigate the underlying team cognitive processes. Measured outcomes and fNIRS data support our predictions. Combining conventional experiment and advanced neuroimaging techniques, our study informs theory and practice by providing evidence of how functional diversity affects team creativity.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NA) [Grant 72172132] and CPA Ontario’s Centre for Sustainability Reporting and Performance Management (NA).Supplemental Material: The online supplemental appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02157 .</content>

    <title>ChatGPT for Textual Analysis? How to Use Generative LLMs in Accounting Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative large language models (GLLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, are emerging as powerful tools for textual analysis tasks in accounting research. GLLMs can solve any textual analysis task solvable using nongenerative methods as well as tasks previously only solvable using human coding. Whereas GLLMs are new and powerful, they also come with limitations and present new challenges that require care and due diligence. This paper highlights the applications of GLLMs for accounting research and compares them with existing methods. It also provides a framework on how to effectively use GLLMs by addressing key considerations, such as model selection, prompt engineering, and ensuring construct validity. In a case study, I demonstrate the capabilities of GLLMs by detecting nonanswers in earnings conference calls, a traditionally challenging task to automate. The new GPT method achieves an accuracy of 96% and reduces the nonanswer error rate by 70% relative to the existing Gow et al. (2021) method. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing bias, replicability, and data sharing concerns when using GLLMs. Taken together, this paper provides researchers, reviewers, and editors with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and evaluate GLLMs for academic research.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Supported by the Foster School of Business – University of Washington.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03253 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Lockups in Stock Mergers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document the frequent use of stock lockup agreements in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) paid in stock and examine the corporate determinants and consequences of the use and duration of lockups. Lockup agreements prohibit target shareholders from selling shares issued by the acquirer as a means of payment for a prespecified period. We find support for the hypothesis that target shareholders agree to lockups to precommit to hold on to the acquirer’s stock if they believe the merger’s long-term fundamentals are strong. Consistent with our hypothesis, lockups come with larger acquirer announcement returns, particularly when acquirer valuations are high; ex ante, lockup adoption likelihood increases with acquirers’ valuation. Lockups also come with higher deal completion likelihood, shorter merger negotiations, and higher long-term operating performance. We conclude the market interprets lockups as a signal of strong fundamentals, particularly when acquirers’ valuations are high.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00993 .</content>

    <title>Managerial Ability and Labor Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The capability of higher-ability managers to acquire and use resources more efficiently than lower-ability managers suggests a positive linear relation between labor investment efficiency (LIE) and managerial ability (MA). However, a puzzle emerges about how the best managers set themselves apart from their peers, calling into question the linearity of the relation between LIE and MA. We explore this puzzle by asking how the highest-ability managers achieve the highest performance levels. We then investigate this puzzle empirically by considering alternatives to a linear relation between LIE and MA. We begin with the distinction that managers achieve the highest performance when they combine efficient exploitation of existing products and services with successful exploration for innovations in products and services. This point is relevant to our puzzle because a firm’s labor needs for exploration are high and unpredictable. Thus, we expect the highest-ability managers to purposefully invest more than predicted by a model of optimal labor investment across firms. In contrast, we expect low-ability managers, who are less able to evaluate, forecast, and make efficient investments, to deviate more from predicted labor investment and vacillate between over- and underinvestment. We present evidence that supports our predictions of nonlinear relations between LIE and MA, with high-ability managers investing more than predicted and low-ability managers over- and underinvesting. We make and test related hypotheses about exploration (investment in research and development), and we probe further by relating future firm performance to over- and underinvestment in labor for different levels of MA.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the CPA Alberta Education Foundation.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01932 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is evidence that many people do not report their types truthfully in strategy-proof mechanisms. One of the leading explanations is mechanism complexity. We propose a novel way of describing any strategy-proof mechanism with the aim to reduce the ensuing cognitive load on players and, hence, to increase truthful reporting. The description highlights that a player is guaranteed to obtain a most preferred feasible allocation based on her reported type and that feasibility depends only on the other players’ reports. Optimality of truthful reporting should therefore become more “apparent.” We experimentally test this prediction using the top trading cycles mechanism for matching applicants to positions. The proposed description increases truth-telling. This increase positively interacts with subject numeracy.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02531 .</content>

    <title>Intertemporal Pricing with Resellers: An Empirical Study of Product Drops</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product drops occur when a retailer releases a limited-edition product line on a specific date for a short period of time. Due to limited inventory of the product and the short sales horizon, a resale market emerges where products may resell at higher prices once the firm stocks out. The firm faces a central tradeoff: pricing too high may lead to a longer stockout time and future markdowns; pricing too low may lead to transfer of profits to resellers. Any firm in this position may ask, “How do resellers impact my profit?” To answer this question, we build a dynamic structural model that captures customer decisions to consume or strategically resell, as well as the firm’s intertemporal pricing decision in the presence of resellers. We estimate our model using a unique data set from a retailer of baby clothing with weekly product drops, where customers engage in a resale marketplace through Facebook groups. We find resale data collection and analysis is valuable to incorporate into pricing as firm profit increases by 8.8%, and reseller presence reduces firm profit by 5.8% even if resale data are used in pricing. These impacts are magnified by resale market growth, demonstrating that managers need to take action as resale markets gain wider adoption.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04152 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a model in which a low monetary policy rate lowers the cost of corporate debt, potentially spurring productive investment; low interest rates, however, also induce firms to lever up so as to increase payouts to equity. Whereas such leveraged payouts privately benefit shareholders, leverage comes at the social cost of distorting their incentives, thereby lowering productivity and discouraging investment. If leverage is unregulated (for example, because of the presence of a shadow banking system), then the optimal monetary policy seeks to contain such socially costly leveraged payouts by stimulating investment in response to adverse shocks only up to a level below the first best. The optimal monetary policy may even consist of leaning against the wind, that is, not stimulating the economy at all, in order to fully contain leveraged payouts and maintain productive efficiency.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01440 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A critical governance challenge for on-demand digital platforms is to increase the participation of their service providers. In this research, we design novel incentive structures by taking the unique features of on-demand digital platforms into account. In 12 micro randomized trials conducted in partnership with a major on-demand digital platform, we examine how combining monetary with nonmonetary incentives and providing them within a loss-aversion framework could motivate service providers to increase their participation levels. We show that in on-demand platforms the nonmonetary incentives inhibit the impact of monetary incentives on service provider participation once they are offered together. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional work settings, offering incentives within a loss-aversion framework only increases the effectiveness of nonmonetary incentives. We provide theoretical explanations and empirical examinations for these counterintuitive results. The insights from this research could be used by on-demand digital platforms to effectively mobilize and sustain their service providers’ participation to meet real-time stochastic demand.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02603 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women are less financially literate than men, and it has been difficult to determine whether this gap reflects a lack of knowledge or, rather, a lack of confidence. To address this important research question, we designed two survey modules that enable us to calculate the extent to which confidence matters for both financial literacy and behavior. We developed and estimated a model that provides a new measure of financial literacy and disentangles confidence from knowledge. We find that confidence accounts for about 30% of the gender difference in financial literacy. Moreover, both financial knowledge and confidence are linked to stock market participation. We also provide researchers with a method to account for confidence in regressions.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the European Investment Bank Institute (n/a), which is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Multitask Learning and Bandits via Robust Statistics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decision makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real data sets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension d relative to commonly employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for “data-poor” instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance trade-off over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension d. Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real data sets.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>A Graphical Point Process Framework for Understanding Removal Effects in Multi-Touch Attribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers rely on various online advertising channels to reach customers and are increasingly interested in multi-touch attribution, which evaluates the contribution of each touchpoint to a conversion. However, as the numbers of marketing channels and touchpoints increase, the attribution challenge becomes more intricate because of the complex interplay among different touchpoints within and across channels. Utilizing customer path-to-purchase data, this article addresses this challenge by developing a novel graphical point process framework to investigate the relational structure among various touchpoints. Based on this framework, we propose graphical attribution methods that allocate attribution scores to individual touchpoints or corresponding channels for each customer’s path to purchase. These scores are calculated using a probabilistic definition of removal effects. We evaluate the proposed methods and compare their performance with commonly used attribution models through extensive simulation studies and a real-world attribution application.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Satellite images of the parking lots of U.S. retail firms provide information about the firms’ future earnings, and the limited access to these images produces information asymmetry between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors. We construct a cloud-based information risk (CIR) measure to capture this satellite information risk and investigate its asset pricing performance. We find that CIR positively predicts future stock returns of retail firms in the cross-section and that the predictability cannot be explained by weather reasons. We provide evidence that CIR indeed captures the information asymmetry among investors. The profitability of short selling is more pronounced on clear days. The return predictability of CIR is more pronounced in preannouncement periods. During cloudy days, parking lot traffic data from satellite images are harder to obtain, and the retail store sales estimated using parking lot data are noisier. We further show that high CIR is associated with low liquidity and that the decrease in liquidity purchases is greater than the decrease in liquidity sales. Our empirical analyses suggest that information asymmetry is priced and that CIR affects equity premiums through the liquidity channel, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions from a noisy rational expectations equilibrium model under imperfect competition.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Randomized experiments with treatment and control groups are an important tool to measure the impacts of interventions. However, in experimental settings with one-sided noncompliance extant empirical approaches may not produce the estimands a decision maker needs to solve the problem of interest. For example, these experimental designs are common in digital advertising settings but typical methods do not yield effects that inform the intensive margin: how many consumers should be reached or how much should be spent on a campaign. We propose a solution that combines a novel multicell experimental design with modern estimation techniques that enables decision makers to solve problems with an intensive margin. Our design is straightforward to implement and does not require additional budget. We illustrate our method through simulations calibrated using an advertising experiment at Facebook, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios and its advantage over direct optimization approaches.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dubé, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01185 .</content>

    <title>Planning Bike Lanes with Data: Ridership, Congestion, and Path Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Urban infrastructure is vital for sustainable cities. In recent years, municipal governments have invested heavily in the expansion of bike lane networks to meet growing demand, promote ridership, and reduce emissions. However, reallocating road capacity to cycling is often contentious because of the risk of amplifying traffic congestion. In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment—including the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest—with the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago’s bike lane network. We estimate that adding 25 miles of bike lanes as prescribed by our model can lift cycling ridership from 3.6% to 6.1%, with at most a 9.4% increase in driving times. We also find that three intuitive heuristics for bike lane planning can lead to lower ridership and worse congestion outcomes, highlighting the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to urban infrastructure planning.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: Funding: The authors acknowledge funding from the UCLA Anderson Easton Technology Management Center (Siddiq &amp; Zhang) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2022-04950] and TD-MDAL Research Grant from the Rotman School of Management (Liu).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00775 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bankruptcy reforms that improve lenders’ ability to recover claims from financially distressed borrowers can mitigate zombie lending. However, we show that after a 2016 bankruptcy reform in India, lenders are reluctant to recognize zombie credit as nonperforming, impeding reform efficacy. A subsequent complementary regulation targeting lender discretion in recognizing nonperforming assets improves zombie recognition fivefold. The lender disincentive to recognize zombies arises from undercapitalized banks’ reluctance to realize loan losses and political economy frictions at state-owned banks. Resolving zombie credit allows lenders to redirect credit to healthy borrowers, but effects are muted at banks more exposed to zombie borrowers.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: The authors are grateful for financial support provided by the NSE-NYU Stern Initiative on the Study of Indian Capital Markets.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01356 .</content>

    <title>Inference and Impact of Category Captaincy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies category captaincy, a vertical relationship where retailers delegate shelf placement and pricing decisions of an entire product category to one of the leading manufacturers within that category. These contracts involve preferential treatment given to certain brands within the retailer. However, they are confidential, and empirical analysis has been limited. To study the prevalence and welfare impact of these contracts, I develop a novel approach to infer the presence of captaincy contracts based on preferential treatment in shelf placement and pricing. I first classify retailers into different captaincy types based on a brand × retailer specific quality of shelf placement inferred from a demand model. I then conduct pricing tests and find that captains, in line with theoretical predictions and industry anecdotes, eliminate double markups from their own products but not from competitor products. Comparative statics show that captaincy relationships increase the market share of the captain, but they can also increase consumer welfare by about 5% due to the elimination of double markups on the captain’s products.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02039 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online advertising impressions are traded through a multitiered network of intermediaries. We model the revenue optimization of a publisher that auctions off advertising impressions to intermediary exchanges, which, in turn, run their own internal auctions among the advertisers they represent. We show that the resulting auction-of-auctions market arrangement suffers from a double marginalization problem: the multitier bid shading prompts the publisher to raise the reserve price above the level under the nonintermediated benchmark. The reserve distortion decreases channel efficiency as well as the profits of all channel members. Our findings also demonstrate that, in the auction of auctions, reserve price optimization is both more intricate and more important than in the direct mechanism: optimal reserves depend on the number of both exchanges and advertisers. Moreover, optimizing the reserve price given a fixed number of bidders may be more profitable than keeping the auction absolute and adding more bidders. Interestingly, we find that a simple scheme in which exchanges coordinate to charge their advertisers a fixed percentage commission perfectly coordinates the channel.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05233 .</content>

    <title>Online Algorithms for Matching Platforms with Multichannel Traffic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two-sided platforms rely on their recommendation algorithms to help visitors successfully find a match. However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch, which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits, a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit’s volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform’s recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this external traffic in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform’s problem as a special case of online matching, where (using VolunteerMatch terminology) volunteers arrive sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which has a finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform’s online algorithm selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating the performance of different algorithms, we refine the notion of competitive ratio by parameterizing it based on the amount of external traffic. After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly used algorithm that is optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm, adaptive capacity (AC), which accounts for matches differently based on whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower bound on AC’s competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external traffic and that is close to (and, in some regimes, exactly matches) the parameterized upper bound we establish on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical study motivated by VolunteerMatch data where we demonstrate the strong performance of AC relative to current practice and further our understanding of the difference between AC and other commonly used algorithms.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00910 .</content>

    <title>Impact of OM Content in Earnings Calls on a Firm’s Stock Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether and to what extent financial markets value and respond to operations management (OM)-related information in quarterly earnings calls directed toward financial market participants. We develop and use a novel construct called “stated OM focus” (SOMF) to mine the incidence of and emphasis on OM information in the quarterly earnings conference calls for a large cross-section of firms (S&amp;P 1500) over a time frame of 15 years. We empirically establish the value-relevance of OM information as well as summarize and capture both explanatory and predictive aspects of the OM function’s contribution to firm value. We show that OM-related information disclosed by firms systematically, significantly, positively, and persistently affects abnormal stock returns after controlling for known covariates and controls (financial metrics, standard OM metrics, firm and time effects, and lexical-structure related) and after accounting for earnings surprise. Furthermore, we find evidence that firms’ stated OM focus bears significant predictive power in the short term. Long-short portfolios, created using a sorting signal derived solely from stated OM-focus information, predict future abnormal returns consistently over one, two and three months forward from the earnings call event. We show that the OM information metric is reliable and bears internal, external, and predictive validity. These findings offer useful implications for firms, financial market participants, and OM function stakeholders.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02221 .</content>

    <title>Cyberattacks, Operational Disruption, and Investment in Resilience Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increased frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks, policymakers and the private sector search for ways to counter this threat. One of the main initiatives suggested to achieve this goal is sharing cybersecurity-related information. Although the general belief is that information sharing can increase both industry profit and social welfare, it is unclear whether firms would voluntarily share such information. In this paper, we examine the incentives of firms to share cybersecurity-related information, how information sharing impacts investments in cyber resilience, and the aggregate impact on welfare. We find that firms only voluntarily share information in less competitive markets when the impact of the disruption is high. In all other cases, firms elect not to share information, despite potential welfare benefits. To facilitate information sharing, we investigate an exclusionary policy (i.e., sharing must be mutual) and demonstrate market conditions under which this policy incentivizes information sharing. However, when competition is intense, even the exclusionary policy is ineffective because it reduces industry profit. To inform stronger interventions, we examine firms being mandated to disclose their private cyberthreat information. We demonstrate that an opportunity does exist for such disclosure, particularly when the cost of investing in cyber resilience is high. However, policymakers must use caution with such a policy because applying this intervention when investment costs are not high leads to a steep reduction in welfare.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Performance Attribution for Portfolio Constraints</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new performance attribution framework that decomposes a constrained portfolio’s holdings, expected returns, variance, expected utility, and realized returns into components attributable to (1) the unconstrained mean-variance optimal portfolio; (2) individual static constraints; and (3) information, if any, arising from those constraints. A key contribution of our framework is the recognition that constraints may contain information that is correlated with returns, in which case imposing such constraints can affect performance. We extend our framework to accommodate estimation risk in portfolio construction using Bayesian portfolio analysis, which allows one to select constraints that improve—or are least detrimental to—future performance. We provide simulations and empirical examples involving constraints on environmental, social, and governance portfolios. Under certain scenarios, constraints may improve portfolio performance relative to a passive benchmark that does not account for the information contained in these constraints.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: Research funding from the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant 2022YFA1007900], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12271013, 72342004], Peking University’s Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05365 .</content>

    <title>Intraday Market Return Predictability Culled from the Factor Zoo</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide strong empirical evidence for time-series predictability of the intraday return on the aggregate market portfolio by exploiting lagged high-frequency cross-sectional returns on the factor zoo. Our results rely on the use of modern machine-learning techniques to regularize the predictive regressions and help tame the signals stemming from the zoo together with techniques from financial econometrics to differentiate between continuous and theoretically nonpredictable discontinuous high-frequency price increments. Using the predictions from the model estimated for the aggregate market portfolio in the formulation of simple intraday trading strategies for a set of highly liquid ETFs results in sizeable out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and alphas after accounting for transaction costs. Further dissecting the abnormal intraday returns, we find that most of the superior performance may be traced to periods of high economic uncertainty and a few key factors related to tail risk and liquidity, pointing to slow-moving capital and the gradual incorporation of new information as the underlying mechanisms at work.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01657 .</content>

    <title>Delegation with Technology Migration: An Empirical Analysis of Mobile Virtual Network Operators</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on the performance of mobile network operators (MNOs) in the presence of overlapping generations of wireless mobile network technologies (2G and 3 G). MVNOs distribute MNOs’ mobile services to customers without owning any spectrum or network infrastructures, either as a subsidiary (branded MVNOs) or delegated under wholesale agreements with MNOs (third-party MVNOs). We investigate MVNO value chain governance, that is, delegation, in the context of overlapping generations of technologies. Leveraging a proprietary data set, we design a quasi-experiment to analyze the impact of branded and third-party MVNOs in 2G and 3 G market expansion. Using first a difference-in-differences analysis and then dynamic propensity score matching, we find that an MNO’s 2G market share increases if the MNO launches a third-party MVNO, whereas its 3 G market share increases if it launches a branded MVNO. More importantly, the positive effects of branded MVNOs diminish over time, but those of third-party MVNOs become stronger over time. For managers challenged by managing overlapping generations of technologies, it is important to customize value chain governance for market expansion: to create branded MVNOs to explore new mobile technologies, and to delegate to third-party MVNOs to exploit existing technology markets when the technology market is mature.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01832 .</content>

    <title>Intersectional Peer Effects at Work: The Effect of White Coworkers on Black Women’s Careers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how having more White coworkers influences the subsequent retention and promotion of Black women relative to other race-gender groups. Studying 9,037 new hires at a professional services firm, we first document large racial turnover and promotion gaps: Even after controlling for observable characteristics, Black employees are 6.7 percentage points (32%) more likely to turn over within two years and 18.7 percentage points (26%) less likely to be promoted on time than their White counterparts. The largest turnover gap is between Black and White women, at 8.9 percentage points (51%). We argue that initial assignment to project teams is conditionally random based on placebo tests and qualitative evidence. Under this assumption, we show that a one-standard-deviation (20.8 percentage points) increase in the share of White coworkers is associated with a 15.8-percentage-point increase in turnover and an 11.5-percentage-point decrease in promotion for Black women. We refer to these effects as intersectional: Black women are the only race-gender group whose turnover and promotion are negatively impacted by White coworkers. We explore potential causal pathways through which these peer effects may emerge: Black women who were initially assigned to Whiter teams are subsequently more likely to be labeled as low performers and report fewer billable hours, both of which are predictors of higher turnover and lower promotion for all employees. Our findings contribute to the literature on peer effects, intersectionality, and the practice of managing race and gender inequality in organizations.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership at University of California, Berkeley-Haas, Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research, and the Hub for Equal Representation at the London School of Economics and Political Science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02010 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A war‐related factor model derived from textual analysis of media news reports explains the cross section of expected stock returns. Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how relative performance evaluation (RPE) affects industry competition—a question relevant for corporate boards interested in incentivizing executives. Using U.S. airline data, we estimate a dynamic game of competition between heterogeneous firms in an oligopolistic market, with managers incentivized by RPE contracts. While RPE can induce a firm to compete more intensely by smoothing compensation, it also amplifies a firm’s cost efficiency relative to its peers and can weaken competition from inefficient firms. The first effect dominates in small markets and the second in median-sized markets. RPE has little effect in large, highly profitable markets.</content>

    <title>An Empirical Study of Strategic Opacity in Crowdsourced Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowd-voting mechanisms are commonly used to implement scalable evaluations of crowdsourced creative submissions. Unfortunately, the use of crowd-voting also raises the potential for gaming and manipulation. Manipulation is problematic because (1) submitters’ motivation depends on their belief that the system is meritocratic, and (2) manipulated feedback may undermine learning, as submitters seek to learn from received evaluations and those of peers. In this work, we consider a design approach to addressing the issue, focusing on the notion of strategic opacity, i.e., purposefully obfuscating evaluation procedures. On the one hand, opacity may reduce the incentive and thus the prevalence of vote manipulation, and submitters may instead dedicate that time and effort to improving their submission quantity or quality. On the other hand, because opacity makes it difficult for submitters to discern the returns to legitimate effort, submitters may also reduce their submission effort or simply exit the market. We explored this tension via a multimethod study employing field experiments at 99designs and a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observed consistent results across all experiments: opacity leads to reductions in gaming in these crowdsourcing contests and significant increases in the allocation of effort toward legitimate vs. illegitimate activities, with no discernible influence on contest participation. We discuss boundary conditions and the implications for contest organizers and contest platform operators.</content>

    <title>Information Technology Firms and Revenue Stall, 1950-2015: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A slowdown in revenue growth, referred to as revenue stall in this study, is a key concern for any firm. We examine how information technology-producing firms (i.e., IT firms) differ from non-IT firms in experiencing revenue stall and in benefiting from R&amp;D investments in terms of reduced revenue stall. We hypothesize that whereas IT firms experience more revenue stall than non-IT firms, R&amp;D investments reduce revenue stall to a greater extent in IT firms than in non-IT firms. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of more than 1,400 large public firms in the United States from 1950 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses. Consistent with the theoretical arguments underlying our hypotheses, we also find that IT firms experience higher competition, dynamism, and turbulence, and have higher intangible assets than non-IT firms.</content>

    <title>Producing the “We” in High-Risk Online Activism: Identity Configurations in My Stealthy Freedom</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The research on online social movements generally concludes that collective identity, i.e., the sense of we-ness that individual protesters in a movement share, is not only unattainable but also dispensable, even though it is considered a defining feature of traditional movements. In this paper, we explore one of the boundary conditions of these findings, namely the riskiness of protest practices. Analysing the high-risk social movement, My Stealthy Freedom (MySF), which contests compulsory hijab in Iran in a way that hybridizes online and offline protest practices, we show that a sense of collectiveness can be instantiated in online social movements, why it is critical to the success of high-risk activism, and how it is (re)produced. Comparing and contrasting three instantiations of MySF, each of which was enacted on a different social media platform, we develop a theoretical model of how feelings of collectiveness are enacted in high-risk online activism. In addition to providing guidance for online movements where collective identity is desirable, our study challenges prior research on online activism by theorizing the role of embodiment, affect, and the dialectic between activists’ personal and the movement’s collective identity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As AI becomes integral to enterprise decision-making, this study explores the collaborative dynamics between managers and AI systems, focusing on human willingness to delegate tasks to AI. Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employed a hidden Markov model in a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We found that there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time—in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings.</content>

    <title>The Complementor’s Dilemma: Navigating Growth Ambitions and the Dependency on Focal Actors in Platform Ecosystems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on platform ecosystems increasingly recognizes that nonfocal actors such as complementors may have growth ambitions. Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from nonfocal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the nonfocal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. Referring to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, we unpack the process whereby a nonfocal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examined the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a nonfocal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem.</content>

    <title>Mobile Advertising in Distracted Environments: Exploring the Impact of Distractions on Dual-Task Interference</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is increasingly common for consumers to engage with various tasks on their personal devices amid other distractions such as watching television at home, shopping at malls, or attending concerts. While this split in attention poses challenges, it also opens valuable opportunities for advertisers to strategically push targeted advertisements based on information about the user’s environment. Across a series of controlled lab experiments using a custom app developed for this study, we demonstrate how marketers can optimize pop-up advertising on consumers’ personal devices within distraction-filled environments. In doing so, we extend traditional insights from dual-task interference studies that have previously focused on corresponding tasks in isolation, without considering any stimuli from the environment. Our results indicate that, in the presence of additional stimuli from the environment, a facilitating relationship exists between the attention paid to a task and the effectiveness of pop-up advertisements interrupting the task. However, this relationship is moderated by the extent of attention diffusion from the environment. As the distance between the task and the environment increases, consumer attention to the task is more diffused, resulting in poorer encoding of the pop-up advertisements. Critically, optimizing the content and timing of pop-up advertisements to the environmental content can significantly improve their effectiveness. Our results have important implications for helping marketers develop actionable strategies for mobile advertising in distraction-filled environments.</content>

    <title>Automating in High-Expertise, Low-Label Environments: Evidence-Based Medicine by Expert-Augmented Few-Shot Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many real-world process automation environments are rife with high-expertise and limited labeled data. We propose a computational design science artifact to automate systematic review (SR) in such an environment. SR is a manual process that collects and synthesizes data from medical literature to inform medical decisions and improve clinical practice. Existing machine learning solutions for SR automation suffer from a lack of labeled data and a misrepresentation of the high-expertise manual process. Motivated by humans’ impressive capability to learn from limited examples, we propose a principled and generalizable few-shot learning framework—FastSR—to automate the multistep, expertise-intensive SR process using minimal training data. Informed by SR experts’ annotation logic, FastSR extends the traditional few-shot learning framework by including (1) various representations to account for diverse SR knowledge, (2) attention mechanisms to reflect semantic correspondence of medical text fragments, and (3) shared representations to jointly learn interrelated tasks (i.e., sentence classification and sequence tagging). We instantiated and evaluated FastSR on three test beds: full-text articles from Wilson disease (WD) and COVID-19, as well as a public dataset (EBM-NLP) containing clinical trial abstracts on a wide range of diseases. Our experiments demonstrate that FastSR significantly outperforms several benchmarking solutions and expedites the SR project by up to 65%. We critically examine the SR outcomes and practical advantages of FastSR compared to other ML and manual SR solutions and propose a new FastSR-augmented protocol. Overall, our multifaceted evaluation quantitatively and qualitatively underscores the efficacy and applicability of FastSR in expediting SR. Our results have important implications for designing computational artifacts for automating/augmenting processes in high-expertise, low-label environments.</content>

    <title>The Interplay Between Healthcare Information Technologies and Denied Claims</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of health information technology (HIT) in reducing claim denials, which are a significant burden for healthcare providers in the U.S. We theorize the impacts of electronic health records (EHRs) on claim denials, starting with an examination of EHR adoption and followed by a deeper assessment of how EHRs are sourced both within a hospital and across hospitals in the same health system. We propose that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. Using a large-scale dataset of claim records from the state of Maryland from 2012-2016, we found that the greater the EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, our findings suggest that EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observed a decrease in claim denials when physicians previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multifaceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance.</content>

    <title>Does Ransomware Make Investors “WannaCry”? On Investors’ Divergent Reactions to Ransomware Hits and Near Misses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, ransomware has become one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with successful attacks causing severe operational disruptions and staggering damages. Rationally speaking, investors should react negatively to firms’ ransomware disclosures, but this may not always be the case. Based on norm theory, we describe a paradoxical phenomenon wherein investors exhibit negative reactions to ransomware hits (i.e., events that led to operational disruptions) but positive reactions to near misses (i.e., events in which operational disruptions were narrowly avoided). The positive reactions occur due to an outcome bias in which near-miss events—events that are objectively negative but less severe than expected—are viewed positively instead of negatively. We tested these predictions by reporting on an investigation of stock market reactions to disclosures of ransomware hits vs. near misses. To do so, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of ransomware incidents disclosed by U.S. public firms. Using the event study method, we estimated abnormal stock market returns and found evidence in support of our predictions. First, in line with expectations, ransomware hits that led to the expected severe impact resulted in stock price drops of -4.40%. However, near misses, where disruptions were avoided, were rewarded with gains of 2.87%, confirming positive instead of negative reactions. This offers new insights into investors’ biased responses to certain cybersecurity incidents. These positive reactions, however, represent a call for caution because, albeit seemingly favorable, they mask underlying risks.</content>

    <title>Do Digital Platforms Improve the Performance of Nonbinding Contracts? Evidence From the Amazon Freight Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how digital platforms influence the performance of nonbinding contracts. Businesses in many industries with high uncertainty, such as trucking freight and construction, simultaneously use nonbinding contracts, which impose no legal sanctions for refusals, and spot markets, which facilitate real-time, flexible transactions with market-determined prices. Understanding the conditions under which nonbinding contracts perform is a major concern in these industries. Leveraging the entry of the Amazon Freight platform in the trucking freight industry, we demonstrate that adding a digital platform-enabled spot marketplace improves the performance of nonbinding contracts. We identified several mechanisms driving this effect: (1) expanding carriers’ transportation capacity, (2) lowering spot market prices, and (3) reducing shippers’ reliance on nonbinding contracts for shorter-haul truckloads. Moreover, the digital platform’s impact on enhancing nonbinding contract performance is particularly pronounced in markets with volatile demand and shorter hauls. This research contributes to understanding the impacts of digital platforms in highly uncertain industries that simultaneously use nonbinding contracts and spot markets. Our findings provide implications to policymakers and business managers on leveraging digital platforms to improve operational efficiency in highly uncertain industries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Augmented reality (AR) is rapidly emerging as a transformative display technology, blending computer-generated content with the real-world environment in real time. Using divided attention theory, this study investigates how different information delivery channels (i.e., AR vs. mobile phone) and the nature of information (i.e., dependence on specific physical context and complexity) affect work performance. A field experiment in the aircraft maintenance context demonstrates that the effect on work performance of providing information via AR vs. a mobile phone is mediated by work attentiveness. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of AR is particularly pronounced when information is highly dependent on the specific physical context but diminishes when information complexity is high. This research deepens our understanding of how presenting information directly in front of users’ eyes (i.e., via AR) affects their attention management and work performance. The findings have significant implications for firms in terms of how to leverage AR to enhance work performance in industrial settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations is on the rise, firms frequently report failures and setbacks in their development and implementation of AI innovation efforts. One common issue behind many failing AI initiatives is that they are organized just like other information technology (IT) innovation efforts. To elucidate why and how the production of AI and IT innovations may need to be managed differently, this study juxtaposes these two types of innovations based on two key dimensions of the Schumpeterian framework: the form (product vs. process) and magnitude (radical vs. incremental) of innovations. By analyzing a matched sample of AI and IT patents, we found robust evidence that AI innovations are less radical and more process oriented than comparable IT innovations. Drawing upon our empirical discovery, we developed a conceptual framework to suggest a new way to think about organizing AI innovation. Our research contributes to the literature and practice on AI innovation by illuminating the comparative differences between AI innovations and other IT innovations and advancing a set of empirically derived propositions on how firms may be able to better manage their AI innovation activities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial is inspired by a growing concern within the information systems (IS) community that novelty has become a dominant criterion for publication, despite being unevenly interpreted and poorly specified. In our editorial experience, when authors are told that their papers lack novelty, they often receive little concrete guidance on what precisely counts as novelty, how it varies across paradigms, or how it should be balanced with rigor and relevance.</content>

    <title>Engaging Physicians with Introductory Incentives: References to Online and Offline Income</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incentives make or break user contributions. While providing introductory incentives to attract new users has become increasingly popular among online communities, their impact on user contributions remains largely unknown. Utilizing a policy change that doubled the incentives paid to physicians in a leading online health community, we examined the impacts of both the initiation and the termination of such introductory incentives on physician contributions (in terms of patient consultations) and how the impacts varied according to the physician’s online and offline income. We found that despite an increase in physician contributions during the policy window, the introductory incentives unintentionally decreased physician contributions after the policy window ended. Additionally, physicians tended to anchor their contributions using their online rather than offline income as a reference point, suggesting that mental accounting was at play. Our findings provide a cautionary perspective on the unintended consequences of using introductory incentives and reveal the associated mechanisms of mental accounting when users make contributions (or not) to online communities. These findings provide important implications for incentive design and user engagement in online communities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals are often unable to assess the veracity of news claims—especially on social media platforms. Recent research has suggested that interventions indicating normative signals, such as flagging false claims, are not always effective. We propose an approach in which users are provided with discursive evidence to consider in determining the veracity of claims rather than depending on normative true or false flags. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different forms of discursive evidence on individual judgments of the veracity of news claims. We found that providing such evidence can significantly improve individuals’ judgment of both true and false news claims—with certain caveats. Providing discursive evidence with high evidence strength leads to a general increase in veracity judgment. Discursive evidence containing items with lower evidence strength may shift believability— thus improving judgments for either true or false claims but degrading them for the other. We also identify important asymmetries between true and false claims, finding that the effect of some evidence may be improved if people are in a more critical mindset—for example, by priming them to think about the concept of truth and lies. Taken together, these results extend knowledge on the problem of fake news and may suggest effective approaches to address the problem without diminishing attention to true news.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how “Hashtag Dance Challenges” (HDCs), a phenomenon popularized on the short-video platform TikTok, are instrumental in helping music artists gain traction in the digital music marketplace. HDCs represent an appealing combination of music and dance, designed to engage users and achieve virality, thereby benefiting artists whose music is featured. This research focuses on how HDCs contribute to the success of women artists, as compared to men, in an industry known for its diversity but challenged by gender inclusivity. We apply role congruity theory to posit that women artists are in a better position to derive benefits from being featured on HDCs, relative to male artists, particularly in cases of gender concordance—when both the creator and the artist are women. We measure the benefits of HDCs using daily changes in the artist’s followership on Spotify, a leading music streaming service, and test our hypotheses using song and artist-level data collected from Spotify and TikTok. We found that artists featured in a new HDC achieve a significant increase in followership on Spotify, relative to similar artists not featured in an HDC. Further, we observed that women creators drive this effect, enhancing the daily growth of Spotify followers by approximately 3% more for women artists, underscoring the value of gender concordance. Our findings shed light on the role of short videos, especially through the vehicle of HDCs, in advancing women artists, while also promoting inclusivity within the digital music industry.</content>

    <title>The global sourcing of green products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have seen a rise in global trade of “green products”—those designed to minimize environmental harm compared to traditional alternatives. In this study, we examine the relevance of pollution haven effects—i.e., shifts of production toward countries with less stringent environmental standards—in firms’ global sourcing strategies for green products. Given the importance of credible and sustainable manufacturing practices in firms’ global value chains for green products, we expect that country environmental standards shape global sourcing decisions for green versus non-green products differently. Our findings using data on global imports and exports for more than 5000 distinct products over the 2002–2019 period show that green products are more likely to be sourced from countries with higher environmental stringency, whereas non-green product sourcing patterns align with prior research, which emphasizes the appeal of lower environmental standards and cost-efficiency. This green sourcing effect is stronger for consumer-facing products and for sourcing into countries where consumer engagement in environmentalism is higher and non-governmental organizations are more active. Unlike prior research that implies that higher environmental standards hurt exporters, our results suggest that such standards can benefit green product exporters.</content>

    <title>Sustainability Cues Can Delay Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rise of environmental concerns in recent decades, many companies have joined the initiative to advertise and promote sustainable consumption. The current research examines how providing sustainability cues to consumers might have unintended consequences of which practitioners and policymakers may not be fully aware. One pilot study and ten main studies, including two real-choice studies, show that a sustainability cue may delay consumption. That is, in an intertemporal choice, a sustainability cue can increase preference for a larger-later option over a smaller-sooner option. This effect occurs because a sustainability cue shifts a consumer’s temporal focus toward the future, leading to a shorter perceived wait time for the larger-later option. The findings further show that the delay does not emerge among those with strong green consumption values and can be circumvented if firms communicate the immediate need or instant payoff of sustainable actions. By investigating how sustainability cues shift consumer preferences between two options separated in time, the current research contributes to the literature on both sustainable consumption and intertemporal choice. The findings offer practitioners and policymakers guidelines to nudge consumers’ sustainable consumption more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model populism as the dissemination of a false “alternative reality,” according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism. (JEL D72, D82, D83)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that predictable uninformed cash flows forecast aggregate market stock returns. Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9. These results suggest price pressure is a widespread result of flows, not an anomaly. (JEL G12, G14, G35)</content>

    <title>Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This “offset” policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A nested bundling strategy creates menus in which more expensive bundles include all the goods of less expensive ones. We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles. (JEL D11, D21, D42, D82, M31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-term effect of public R&amp;D on growth in manufacturing by analyzing new data from the Cold War–era space race. We develop a novel empirical strategy that leverages US-Soviet rivalry in space technology to isolate windfall R&amp;D spending. Our results demonstrate that public R&amp;D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors. While migration responses were important, they were not sufficient to generate a wedge between local and national effects. The iconic moonshot R&amp;D program had only modest economic effects for both the local and national space-related sectors. (JEL E22, H54, L60, N12, N42, N62, O47)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Supplemental Security Income program uses a birth weight cutoff at 1,200 grams to determine eligibility. Using birth certificates linked to administrative records, we find low-income families of infants born just below the cutoff receive higher monthly cash benefits (equal to 27 percent of family income) at ages 0–2 with smaller benefits continuing through age 10. Yet we detect no improvements in health care use and mortality in infancy, nor in health and human capital outcomes as observed through young adulthood for these infants. We also find no improvements for their older siblings. (JEL I12, I13, I18, I38, J13, J14, J31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment to quantify the impact of the lifting of the Saudi women's driving ban on women's employment by randomizing rationed spaces in driver's training. Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women. The results underscore the importance of intrahousehold responses that can counteract legal gains in women's freedoms. (JEL C93, D13, J16, J22, K38, O15, O17)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many US colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that “society” dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its “disagreement cost.” We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2. (JEL D31, H24, H31, J22, J31, J62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March 2020, safe asset markets experienced surprising and unprecedented price crashes. We explain how strategic investor behavior can create such market fragility in a model with investors valuing safety, investors valuing liquidity, and constrained dealers. While safety investors and liquidity investors can form a symbiotic relationship with offsetting trades during times of stress, strategic interactions among liquidity investors harbor the potential for self-fulfilling fragility. When the market is fragile, standard flight-to-safety can have a destabilizing effect and trigger a “dash-for-cash” by liquidity investors. Well-designed policy interventions can reduce market fragility ex ante and restore orderly functioning ex post.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a panel of over 28,400 S&amp;P 500 return forecasts by CFOs to examine whether the extent of CFOs’ miscalibration—providing forecast confidence intervals that are too narrow—decreases over time. We find no improvement with task repetition or evidence of learning, that is, no improvement in response to past performance. Across CFOs, miscalibration appears to be a persistent personal trait. We find some evidence that the degree of miscalibration is related to birth cohort and stock market familiarity. (JEL G41, G30, D22, D83, D84)</content>

    <title>Moving toward consensus: an examination of trends in investment fair values</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A primary argument against fair value measurement is the lack of verifiability, where verifiability is defined as consensus in measurement by independent parties. We evaluate this argument by investigating trends in the consensus of reported fair values. Our findings indicate that consensus increased between 2005 and 2019, as evidenced by reductions in the fair value range and standard deviation. Further analyses suggest that enhanced data availability—driven by public dissemination of trade information—serves as a mechanism for this trend. We also document that securities subject to testing by larger external auditors with more resources to take advantage of enhanced data availability are associated with a stronger trend in increasing consensus. Finally, this trend appears to be stronger in situations when management has a heightened opportunity to record a biased estimate. While conventional arguments express concern over management’s ability to manipulate fair values, our results demonstrate patterns consistent with improved verifiability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product reviews, a type of user-generated content (UGC), are found to affect sales; however, their impact on product returns has not been fully explored. Research has revealed that inflated ratings and catchy product images may increase returns, which spells trouble for sellers. To address the issue, we examine howproduct contextualizationin user-posted images and review texts helps online shoppers assess a product’sfunctionalityandaestheticsand, in turn, reduce returns. Using the archival data from an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer, we reveal that contextual cues in UGC help decrease product returns. When comparing the roles of image with text, we explore distinct mechanisms for shoppers’ utilization of contextual cues to assess each type of product feature. For functionality, the level of detail in writing suggests that contextual information for these attributes (e.g., the warmth, stretchability, and water-resistance of a jacket) is likely better delineated in text than image since many of them are measurable (e.g., temperature), can be depicted in subtleties (e.g., running vs. jogging), and, sometimes, on a time dimension (e.g., a two-hour rain). As a result, shoppers’ product evaluation and return decisions are more likely to be influenced by such content. However, our data analysis shows the opposite. Although shoppers perceive verbal contextual cues for these product features as more accurate, detailed, and sufficient, they prefer to use images to assess such attributes because the cost of processing visual information is lower. Regarding aesthetics, since buyers often adopt a sensory-based strategy to evaluate these features (e.g., the design of a shirt), images are likely to be a preferred choice. We find evidence for this argument. Yet, when a product’s aesthetics are closely tied to its geometric fit (e.g., sleeve length), contextual cues in the text have a stronger effect on returns. We offer business insights on leveraging UGC to enhance operating cost management by reducing product returns.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Targeted Automation and Sustaining Human-AI Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many decision processes, a decision maker or planner must review and optionally adjust the recommendations that are generated by a decision support system (DSS). When the DSS is well-tuned to its task, adjustments by a planner can be rare and may even degrade the DSS’s performance. Targeted automation could address these inefficiencies by predicting whether a planner will adjust a recommendation and improve the performance of the system. The remaining recommendations can be automated. However, as more recommendations are automated, fewer will receive planner input. This may starve the prediction model of the observations it needs for retraining. To maintain predictive performance, we must therefore address the loss that automation imposes on the model’s ability to learn from a planner’s decisions over time. Using four years of procurement ordering data from our research partner, a large materials handling equipment manufacturer, we develop and train a series of machine learning classifiers that predict individual instances in which a planner will improve a DSS-generated procurement order decision. We mitigate the performance erosion that automation engenders by structuring the selection of the model’s classification threshold similar to a newsvendor problem, accounting for the value of learning and balancing the costs and benefits of under or over automating. In our setting, this approach automates around 84% of all DSS recommendations while retaining three times more planner improvements than random automation. The models maintain their predictive performance over time, despite losing automated outcomes for retraining and substantial dataset shift. Our research contributes to a broader debate on the allocation of decision authority between humans and algorithms, and creates a framework for targeted automation in an operational setting that balances the net benefits of automation versus the long-term benefits of algorithmic learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore a form of postacquisition integration by which inventors from the target and acquiring organizations share and integrate technological and organizational knowledge, performing joint research and development. We refer to this phenomenon as inventor commingling. Grounded in the knowledge-based view, we posit that commingling enhances the target firm’s innovation performance by enabling the transfer of the acquirer’s organizational knowledge, preserving the target’s existing knowledge base. We explore how commingling differs from structural integration and how the two forms of integration can be combined for postacquisition management. We posit that commingling diminishes the negative effects of structural integration, whereas structural integration may enhance the efficacy of commingling. Because organizational knowledge is firm-specific and cumulative, commingling efficacy should increase with acquirer commingling inventors’ tenure. To test these predictions, we assemble a large sample of acquisitions to study the effect of these forms of postacquisition integration on acquired entity innovation outcomes. Our results support a positive commingling innovation effect, which is more pronounced under structural integration. A high degree of commingling can mitigate the negative effects of postacquisition structural integration documented in the literature. We use direct flights between the acquisition party locations as an instrument to address the potentially endogenous process of inventor commingling. We find consistent results. Our study raises the possibility of inventor commingling as a distinct form of postacquisition integration, which holds the potential of effectively transferring organizational knowledge and supporting postacquisition innovation output, sidestepping the classic postacquisition integration–autonomy trade-off.Funding: This work was supported by Henry Crown Institute of Business Research at Tel-Aviv University; Mack Institute for Innovation Management at Wharton; Wharton Global Initiatives Research Funding Program.</content>

    <title>Seeing Both Sides: How Shared Experience Can Improve Entrepreneur Evaluations of Investors Through Perceived Empathy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarly attention in the venture funding literature is primarily devoted to tie selection, with a great deal of that attention focused on the perspective of the investor evaluating the entrepreneur as a candidate for funding. But venture funding can be conceptualized as a long-term, dual-sided matching process. Two mixed methods studies offer support for a specific basis of background similarity that can influence entrepreneur evaluations of investor tie potential: shared entrepreneurial experience. An archival study of 677 entrepreneurs evaluating 408 investors demonstrates that investors with entrepreneurial experience are more likely to be perceived as empathetic than investors without this experience. In turn, entrepreneurs rate investors whom they perceive to be empathetic more favorably than those they do not perceive to be empathetic. Perceived empathy thus emerges as a mechanism that serves to mediate the positive relationship between shared entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneur ratings of investors. A preregistered between-subjects experiment conducted on 481 entrepreneurs exposed to otherwise comparable investor profiles randomized for experience complements the correlational evidence from the archival study with causal support for each of these paths. Shedding light on the key components of perceived empathy, linguistic analyses indicate the extent to which cognitive perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur thinks) and affective perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur feels) mediate the effect. Gender implications are discussed as this work also documents that women are less likely to traverse the path from entrepreneurship into investing, restricting their ability to reap these relational upsides.Funding: This research was supported by faculty budgets at London Business School and Georgetown University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18429 .</content>

    <title>Round Number Preferences and Left-Digit Bias: Evidence from Credit Card Repayments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine round number preferences and left-digit bias in credit card repayments. We show half of all manual credit card payments are at a small set of round-number values, although all values between the statement minimum and balance were permissible. We use minimum payments, which place a floor on the payment value, to measure the strength of rounding behavior in a natural experiment. We find that when the minimum payment level just rules out a round number from the bottom of the range of possible repayment (e.g., a minimum payment of £50.01 just rules out a payment of £50.00), payments at the next round number jump by 15%–20% (e.g., payments at £60.00). That is, in response to a smooth increase in minimum payments, the selected payments jump up a ladder of round numbers when each lower rung is removed. We also see a classic—although nuanced—left digit bias. When the balance increases such that the left digit changes (e.g., from £1,999 to £2,000), payments in full drop by 3%–8% as if an increase in the left digit makes the balance seem much larger. But average repayments increase by 10%–15%, as smaller partial repayments are all dragged up the ladder rungs. This preference for a small set of round numbers as payment values and this effect of left digit bias on the level of repayment have policy implications. Rounding could be used by policy makers to encourage faster paydown of credit card debt, using one-click “rounds-ups,” defaults, or shrouding. These policy options could deliver interest savings of up to 40%.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [Grants ES/K002201/1, ES/N018192/1, ES/P008976/1, and ES/V004867/1] and the Leverhulme [Grant RP2012-V-022].

    <title>Does Trading Spur Specialization? Evidence from Patenting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the market for technology (facilitated by the establishment of patent exchanges in China) affects innovation specialization. We find that the market for technology induces (i) specialization between patent buyers and sellers, (ii) specialization between patent licensors and licensees, and (iii) specialization based on a firm’s research and development efficiency. All these three specialization patterns indicate that the market for technology promotes comparative advantage–based innovation specialization. Firms with a comparative advantage in creating innovation redirect their resources toward producing patents, whereas firms with a comparative advantage in commercializing innovation switch their effort toward launching new products. A firm also shrinks its scope of innovation and invents in technological fields with greater proximity. Financial friction hampers innovation specialization and relieving trading friction in the market for technology mitigates such negative consequences.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of student loan forbearance on job search outcomes. Our experimental setting is the 2020 federal student loan moratorium that provided some borrowers with forbearance by pausing the payments on their student loans. We use data on unemployment insurance claims, payroll records, and credit histories to compare unemployed borrowers who received forbearance to unemployed borrowers who had to continue making payments. We find that the payment pause did not have any economically or statistically significant effects on job search durations or subsequent incomes. Further, we find no heterogeneity in these effects across borrowers’ financial, demographic, or labor market characteristics.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04047 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm disclosures are mostly unstructured and textual, imposing substantial processing costs on investors. We examine firms’ incentives to enhance the accessibility of these disclosures by expending resources to make them easier for investors to process. We show that an equilibrium with a positive supply of accessibility can be difficult to sustain—even though investors view accessibility as a favorable signal of firm productivity. We further explore how the supply of accessibility interacts with the quality of the numerical (easier-to-analyze) signals and textual (harder-to-analyze) disclosures. Our analysis generates predictions consistent with empirical evidence and offers a framework for evaluating policy initiatives and accounting standards aimed at improving accessibility.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OTT subscription video streaming industry has witnessed significant growth and heightened competition in recent years, marked by the influx of new players. At the same time, we are observing an interesting phenomenon where competing services are forming new alliances that facilitate consumer multi-homing. For instance, Amazon Prime Video has partnered with services, such as (HBO) MAX and Paramount+, to enhance the combined viewing experience for consumers through seamless integration. We build a game-theoretic model with horizontally differentiated services to examine how an alliance facilitating multi-homing between two competing services affects price competition in the market. We find that the alliance’s impact on price competition depends on the level of content differentiation in the market – competition intensifies when differentiation is high but relaxes when differentiation is low. The alliance benefits the partnering services as long as the differentiation is not too high, and interestingly, may increase the profitability of a third non-partnering service when differentiation is sufficiently low. We show that consumer surplus increases under the alliance, even if price competition is relaxed. We also investigate a focal service’s decision to partner with one of two competing services and show that it prefers partnering with a service that has high quality content but a smaller loyal base. Our research offers insights into the current landscape of the OTT video streaming market and provides implications for both managers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Pick-the-Winner-Picker Heuristic: Preference for Categorically Correct Forecasts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People routinely make decisions based on predictions made by others (e.g., political pundits, market analysts), so it is in their best interest to identify high-quality forecasts. Experts characterize good forecasting as minimization of continuous error (i.e., predictions close to the eventual outcome). By contrast, the present work reveals that laypeople typically see good forecasts as those that correctly predict an event’s categorical outcome (e.g., the winning team). Using within-subjects, between-subjects, and incentive-compatible designs, fifteen studies demonstrate this “pick-the-winner-picker heuristic” as well as its psychological mechanism: People evaluate forecasts by assigning separate weights to (a) categorical correctness and (b) continuous error minimization, depending on the overall importance of the categorical and continuous dimensions for that situation. Thus, in the common case when the categorical dimension matters most (e.g., sports contests), people prize forecasts that accurately predicted the categorical outcome (e.g., the winner, not the margin of victory). However, when the categorical dimension’s stakes are experimentally reduced, an attenuation is observed. While this describes how people typically evaluate forecasts, crucially, a dimension’s importance is not necessarily related to its diagnosticity of forecaster skill or reliability. Accordingly, the pick-the-winner-picker heuristic may constitute a normative mistake, while framing manipulations help debias judgments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emotions are a catalyst for actions. They are therefore important for developing an understanding of organizational routines as generative patterns of interdependent actions. To investigate how the performances and action patterns of routines are impacted by emotion changes brought about by alterations in the context of routine enactment, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry centring on a diagnostic routine at a hospital's cardiac first‐aid unit. Our findings show that context changes from off‐peak to peak times and vice versa engendered differences in the emotions of doctors and nurses because of, respectively, conformity and non‐conformity between their salient identities and their situated experiences. This triggered actions that produced variation in routine performances and action patterns. Drawing on our findings, we present a grounded model that theorizes two complementary emotions and identity‐linked mechanisms that explain variety and stability in action patterns. We discuss the theoretical contributions and implications of our model and findings for research on routine dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In contrast to inclusion research that often treats work as a neutral, passive background, this study theorizes the active role of work in producing an inclusive organization. We adopt a practice‐theoretical approach that examines the accomplishment of work activities through their discourses, embodiment, and material arrangements, critically analysing both their inclusionary and exclusionary effects. Through an ethnographic study of an airport security company, we found that performing work along the ends of safety and hospitality played a crucial role in the local, situated formation of a collective of employees, recognition of individual contribution, and emergence of egalitarian relationships among security agents. Building on these findings, we discuss how the enactment of work‐related ends can serve as a key place for inclusion interventions, highlighting the concept of ‘horizon of intelligible actions’ as a central explanation. Furthermore, we emphasize how the interconnectedness – the nexus – of work activities as well as material arrangements are crucial in reinforcing or undermining inclusionary and exclusionary effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advocate that the multiple studies of a common phenomenon that are featured in a typical behavioral research paper be jointly analyzed to provide a statistical summary of the set of studies as a whole. Indeed, we view such single paper meta‐analysis as unavoidable in typical behavioral research papers because (i) such papers feature multiple studies of a common phenomenon, (ii) such papers contain summaries of those studies, and (iii) statistical summaries of studies (i.e., meta‐analyses) are superior to non‐statistical summaries of them. Nonetheless, the current dominant practice is for such papers to feature separate statistical analyses of the data from each of the studies but to contain a non‐statistical summary of the multiple studies rather than a statistical summary. We believe that this is regrettable and therefore aim to rectify matters. Consequently, we review some considerations about meta‐analysis and statistical analysis more broadly; compare single paper meta‐analysis to traditional meta‐analysis and illustrate its benefits via a case study; discuss and dismiss concern about single paper meta‐analysis; and discuss single paper meta‐analysis and the review process.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of executive pay cuts on executive turnover. While previous research has largely focused on the drivers of pay increases of top management team (TMT) members or the effects of their relative pay standing on executive behavior, the prevalence and consequences of pay cuts have received limited attention. Drawing on temporal comparison theory, I argue that executive pay cuts are positively associated with executive turnover. I then propose that the impact of pay cuts on executive turnover depends on contextual cues that influence how executives interpret these cuts. Specifically, I argue that the effect is stronger for salary cuts than for pay‐for‐performance (PFP) cuts. I also argue that the impact of a pay cut is stronger when an executive is paid below the TMT pay level and when few other TMT members experience similar cuts. I test these predictions on a large longitudinal sample of U.S. firms and find empirical support. These results highlight the importance of temporal comparisons in executive pay evaluation processes.</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <title>Public support and &lt;scp&gt;VC&lt;/scp&gt; financing in academic startups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate public support and venture capital (VC) investment in academic startups. Government support may enable follow‐on investment by providing a quality signal to investors. This signal is especially important for academic startups, which face large funding gaps due to their complexity, cutting‐edge nature, and uncertainty regarding the founders' management capabilities and commitment. Using a panel of startups in Germany, our analyses confirm that academic startups are more likely to obtain follow‐on VC investment after receiving public support than non‐academic startups. Further, this effect is limited in time, lasts longer for academic startups, is concentrated in high‐tech manufacturing firms, and is stronger for investments from business angels. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking to foster academic entrepreneurship through policy programs and VC investment.Managerial SummaryObtaining seed and growth capital is essential for potentially highly innovative startups. We show that startups that obtain public support are more likely to receive VC funding and that this effect is stronger for startups with academic founders, approximately twice as large. We further show that this benefit is limited in time, concentrated in the high‐tech manufacturing industry, and more salient for business angel financing than for investment by independent VC funds or corporate VCs. For founders of academic startups, our results imply that acquiring public support might enhance the chances of attracting follow‐on financing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An entrepreneur’s negative attitude toward debt (debt aversion) affects the financing decisions of the businesses they run. Controlling for a range of observable traits, firms run by highly debt-averse entrepreneurs are about 10 percentage points less likely to use debt. The same entrepreneurs are also almost 25% less likely to take up government-guaranteed debt during the COVID-19 crisis. These firms show less interest in COVID-19 support policies if they perceive them to involve debt based on experiments randomizing the framing and labeling of otherwise nearly identical hypothetical COVID-19 support policies as debt or grants.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.

    <title>Getting the Most Out of A/B Tests Using the Asymptotic Minimax-Regret Criteria</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms conduct A/B tests to find a marketing action that improves a value of interest, such as revenue or profit. We develop the asymptotic minimax regret (AMMR) criterion, a practical decision-theoretic approach for choosing among binary marketing actions based on A/B tests. The AMMR is a general large-sample approximation of the minimax-regret criterion from a frequentist standpoint. Our method directly optimizes the decision-relevant metric, accounting for the product of the error probability and the associated magnitude of value loss. Implementing the AMMR decision rule is straightforward; it comprises simply comparing the standardized treatment-effect estimate to the AMMR-optimal decision threshold. The AMMR suggests selecting the treatment whenever the point estimate is positive, as this minimizes the maximum expected net loss from decision errors. A case study of a mobile game company’s A/B testing with Monte Carlo validation demonstrates that the AMMR decision rule effectively selects the optimal marketing action and improves revenue across various data-generating processes.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: K.

    <title>Understanding Talent in Foreign Subsidiaries: A Review, Synthesis, and Way Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations are strategically important, requiring them to tailor their human capital resources to specific needs. Although talent serves as the micro‐level foundation of subsidiaries' organizational‐level human capital resources and strategic outcomes, the current literature is fragmented and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is known, what remains unknown, and what future research should explore about talent in subsidiaries. To this end, we synthesize the literature on talent in subsidiaries over the past two decades, mapping it onto the model of human capital resources emergence. First, we build on existing classifications by integrating the recognized distinction between headquarters‐assigned or locally hired talent with talent nationality, providing a structured perspective that better reflects the realities of subsidiary talent. Second, we examine how talent's individual knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) and social interactions evolve into four subsidiary‐level human capital resources, which in turn contribute to a variety of strategic subsidiary outcomes. Finally, we conclude our review with a future research agenda.</content>

    <title>Real option portfolios and the theory of the multinational enterprise: understanding modes of international involvement in the digital economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <title>Perceptions of knowledge transferability and entrepreneurial entry: The role of firm‐initiated turnover</title>
    <updated>2025-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the understudied effects of perceived non‐transferable knowledge on labor market choices after firm‐initiated turnover. Using a large, nationally representative dataset, I assess how workers' perceptions of knowledge transferability, expectations to remain at a firm, and type of turnover experienced correlate with the decision to engage in entrepreneurship. I find that the release of workers with perceived non‐transferable knowledge into the external environment through firm‐initiated turnover reliably foreshadows entrepreneurship, especially as workers' prior expectations to continue wage employment at a source firm increases. This finding indicates that beyond necessity, opportunity and financial resources, workers' self‐perceptions of their human capital and unfulfilled career expectations matter to the choice of entrepreneurship. It also suggests that firm‐initiated turnover may be a form of knowledge divestiture with important ex‐post implications when workers' perceptions of transferability align with reality.Managerial SummaryManagers often overlook the role of employees' self‐perceptions in shaping post‐turnover career decisions. This study highlights that workers who perceive their knowledge as non‐transferable—skills and expertise they believe cannot easily be applied to other employers—are more likely to pursue entrepreneurship following firm‐initiated turnover. This trend is particularly pronounced among workers who expected to remain in wage employment but were unexpectedly terminated. Firm‐initiated turnover, while serving to shed human capital, can inadvertently encourage the creation of entrepreneurial ventures that may compete with the firm. To mitigate unintended outcomes, firms should (a) recognize the strategic implications of firm‐initiated turnover as a form of knowledge divestiture, with implications for both the firm and the broader market, (b) reevaluate how they manage exits for employees with the firm's specialized knowledge, to reduce the risk of competitive ventures, and (c) engage in open dialogue to align employee expectations with organizational strategies, considering retention or redeployment options for those at risk of a forced exit. By understanding how workers' perceptions and unmet expectations influence their career paths, firms can make more informed decisions about human capital management and turnover strategies, potentially reducing unintended competitive risks while fostering long‐term relationships with former employees.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 2,000 professionals in 24 large corporations in Türkiye, we explore the relationship between female leadership and the relational culture in the workplace. First, we document that although male and female leaders possess equal cognitive capacity, they diverge in socioemotional characteristics. Next, we show that the relational dynamics in the workplace are different under male and female leadership. Male employees form homophilic professional ties under male leadership, whereas we observe less gender-segregated networks under female leadership, where both males and females establish more links with their female colleagues. Female employees receive more support from their leaders and are less likely to quit under female leadership. However, female employees working under female leaders report worse workplace satisfaction and meritocracy. Delving into the mechanisms reveals that female employees depict a gloomier workplace climate in the absence of social support from their female leader. Overall, our findings highlight the influential role of social support from leaders and suggest that increasing supportive female presence in leadership positions may be an effective way to foster a more inclusive relational culture in the workplace.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Science Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy [Grant EXC 2126/1–390838866].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05507 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the preferences of 10,000 capital owners worldwide, including nearly 3,000 from the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, regarding green shareholder voting and divestment. Findings indicate substantial support (53%–72%) for shareholder engagement and green voting, which is more popular and less politically divisive than divestment. Preferences for green voting increase with the likelihood of green outcomes being implemented though 63% of the payoff is attributed to expressive benefits. These results suggest that shareholder engagement and green voting could play a central role in a broader climate strategy portfolio.This paper was accepted by Caroline Flammer, sustainability.Funding: This work was supported by The Norwegian Finance Market Fund (Finansmarkedsfondet).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08186 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how households understand and respond to monetary policy by exploiting the open auctions of early-stage crowdfunding and inferring individuals’ expectations based on their maximum requested interest rates. Using loan listings from Prosper, we find that borrowers adjust their willingness-to-pay interest rates in response to unexpected Federal funds rate changes, whereas anticipated shifts have negligible effects. These responses are more pronounced among high-income, high-credit-score borrowers; large loan applicants; and when Federal Reserve communication is transparent. The responses are highly asymmetric—Borrowers sharply lower rates during unexpected easing but resist increasing them during unexpected tightening. The results are robust to alternative specifications, including regression-discontinuity-in-time designs and alternative measures of monetary policy shock. Lenders also respond to policy shocks and counteract borrowers’ adjustments. Analysis of Robinhood data shows that retail investors mirror this behavior by reducing equity holdings after surprise rate hikes.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the general research fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong [Grant 17504925], the Dean’s Research Fund of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, The Education University of Hong Kong [Grant FLASS/DRF 04635], the Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology [Grant FRG-24-019-MSB], the Seed Funding Grant of EdUHK [Grant 02C11], and the Block Grant Blueprint of EdUHK [Grant 02A23].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04649 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Public and Buyer‐Driven Governance for Supplier Sustainability Development in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments and regulatory agencies in emerging countries are increasingly enforcing labor and environmental protection laws. However, how this growing public governance interrelates with existing buyer‐driven governance to influence supplier sustainability development remains unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal case study involving two rounds of extensive data collection at nine Chinese suppliers of COSMOS, a European multinational company in the consumer electronics industry. We identify three distinctive configurations of how public governance and buyer‐driven governance jointly influence supplier sustainability development. Identifying these configurations builds on prior research that distinguishes between competitive, complementary, and coexistent interactions between public and private governance. We extend this literature by uncovering the causal mechanisms through which each configuration gives rise to a unique sustainability development trajectory. Specifically, we unpack the different elements of each configuration and analyze their influence on suppliers' willingness and ability to pursue sustainability improvement. We conclude by delineating the boundary conditions that define the generalizability of our findings across contexts.</content>

    <title>Bridging the Divide: How Dual‐Background Leaders Unlock Returnee Innovation in Politically Connected Chinese Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how firm leadership diversity influences innovation, focusing on the interplay between returnee leaders – those with international experience – and politically connected leaders. While returnee leaders introduce globally derived innovation practices, their efforts often clash with the state‐aligned agendas of politically connected leaders. By integrating bridging mechanisms into upper echelons theory, we introduce dual‐background leaders – executives with both political and international experience – to bridge these divergent cognitive logics. Through a longitudinal analysis of Chinese publicly listed firms from 2006 to 2016, we find that the positive effect of returnee leaders on innovation performance is significantly weakened in firms with high political connectivity, especially in the absence of dual‐background leaders. Conversely, firms that effectively integrate dual‐background leaders are better positioned to reconcile competing innovation agendas and unlock the synergistic potential of leadership diversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine hidden orders usage by algorithmic traders (ATs) and nonATs. ATs extensively use hidden orders but of smaller size than nonATs, who are the primary contributors to hidden volume. ATs’ relative share of hidden volume decreases with volatility, adverse selection costs, and the relative tick-size. Proprietary ATs (HFTs), who differ from agency ATs (AATs) in their information sets and potential gains from trade, hide orders to reduce competition for liquidity provision, whereas AATs use hidden orders to conceal information in their more informed orders and manage picking-off risk. Finally, superior technology provides limited benefit for hidden order execution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how common ownership affects Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—an important research question given the increasing use of these ratings in investment decisions and corporate evaluations. We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an asymptotic framework for conducting inference on continuous-time asset pricing models using high-frequency returns over an increasing time horizon. Our study focuses on the identification and estimation of risk premiums associated with the continuous component and jumps of various size brackets. We extend the classical Fama-MacBeth regression from the discrete-time setting to a continuous-time factor model, incorporating general dynamics for factors, idiosyncratic components, and factor loadings. Our empirical analysis of U.S. equities, foreign exchange, and commodities underscores the distinct significance of continuous and jump risk premiums for the specific factors constructed within each asset class in determining expected returns.

    <title>Incentive alignment in ecosystems: The role of complementarity types and multi‐sided bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alignment of incentives to improve value creation in ecosystems is crucial to their growth and survival. We examine how two fundamental ecosystem features affect alignment: types of complementarities and their interplay with multi‐sided bargaining over value. Using a formal model, we find that multi‐sided bargaining typically causes misalignment, in patterns that vary dramatically depending on the type of complementarities. For instance, we find that multiplicative complementarities typically entail weak alignment among participants. In contrast, when value creation is constrained by the weakest component, alignment can be alternatively very strong or very weak. We also find that the starting levels of participants' functionality matter. This suggests new avenues for assessing ecosystem performance and the potential for alignment among participants.Managerial SummaryManagers of firms operating in ecosystems need to understand the factors that make their partners aligned with the objective of increasing the ecosystem's value creation. Our research shows that, under multi‐sided bargaining, a major driver of incentive alignment is the type of complementarity between ecosystem's components, that is, how the different pieces of the ecosystem contribute to value creation. Depending on the complementarity type (multiplicative, additive, and weakest‐link), and ecosystem partners' starting levels of functionalities, we show which combinations are intrinsically favorable for aligning development incentives and which ones may undermine alignment. These findings can serve as a guide to diagnose the potential for misalignment among ecosystem partners and how much value creation is at stake.</content>

    <title>Mobilizing the silent majority: Discourse broadening and audience support for entrepreneurial innovations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs operating in a public interactional domain face a unique communicative challenge: they must leverage conversations with a small subset of vocal discursive partners to mobilize support from a broader base of silent audiences observing these exchanges. I propose that entrepreneurs who engage with these vocal discursive partners using what I refer to asdiscourse broadeningare more likely to successfully gain support from the broader silent audience. Using a computational linguistics model to analyze discourses on an online platform featuring entrepreneurial innovations, this study finds an inverted U‐shaped relationship between discourse broadening and support from silent audience members. This relationship is moderated by the similarity between the interpretative lenses of discursive partners and silent audience members, which influences the trade‐off between the benefits and costs of discourse broadening.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face the critical challenge of persuading broader audiences to support their novel ideas despite having limited opportunities to interact with them directly. This article examines how entrepreneurs can strategically engage with their immediate conversational partners on online platforms to gain support from a wider base of silent observers. The findings show that entrepreneurs must carefully balance the extent to which they broaden the discourse with their conversational partners to maximize support from the broader audience. They also need to tailor the level of discourse broadening based on how much their conversational partners represent the views of silent observers. These insights reveal a discursive strategy that entrepreneurs can leverage on online platforms to increase the likelihood of success in commercializing their innovations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human decision-makers frequently override the recommendations generated by predictive algorithms, but it is unclear whether these discretionary overrides add valuable private information or reintroduce human biases and mistakes. We develop new quasi-experimental tools to measure the impact of human discretion over an algorithm on the accuracy of decisions, even when the outcome of interest is only selectively observed, in the context of bail decisions. We find that 90% of the judges in our setting underperform the algorithm when they make a discretionary override, with most making override decisions that are no better than random. Yet the remaining 10% of judges outperform the algorithm in terms of both accuracy and fairness when they make a discretionary override. We provide suggestive evidence on the behavior underlying these differences in judge performance, showing that the high-performing judges are more likely to use relevant private information and are less likely to overreact to highly salient events compared to the low-performing judges.</content>

    <title>A double-edged sword: materiality classifications of sustainability topics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has classified sustainability topics as material or not material for investors. We leverage the staggered release of the SASB classifications from 2013 to 2016 to examine whether and how they prompt changes in U.S. firms’ sustainability performance. We measure sustainability performance using RepRisk scores, which reflect environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incidents. We find that RepRisk scores on sustainability topics classified as material decrease following the release of SASB classifications. Conversely, incident scores on nonmaterial sustainability topics increase. This suggests that firms improve their sustainability performance on topics the SASB deems relevant for investors while simultaneously performing worse on irrelevant topics. Firms adjust their internal sustainability policies to mirror these changes. The changes in sustainability performance occur primarily through two channels. We document that higher exposure to the classifications from shareholder pressure and sustainability-linked executive compensation prompts managers to prioritize sustainability topics classified as relevant for investors over irrelevant ones.</content>

    <title>Should Human Capital Development Programs be Mandatory or Voluntary? Evidence from a Field Experiment on Mentorship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a field experiment, we find that a mandatory mentorship program raises worker productivity, whereas a voluntary version of the program does not. A significant reason why the mandatory program results in larger gains is that the lowest-productivity employees do not participate when the program is voluntary despite their having the greatest treatment benefits. A nationally representative survey of U.S. workers shows wide variation in human capital development program participation, suggesting that understanding self-selection is important for firms’ returns on these programs across a variety of settings. Our findings have implications for resource allocation, experimental design, productivity dispersion, and inequality.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07524 .</content>

    <title>How Middle Managers Affect Frontline Idea Generation: Evidence From Healthcare Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This multiple case study develops a mid‐range theory on how frontline idea generation is affected by the actions of an organization's middle management. The study draws from four acute‐care hospitals in Germany and involves 36 semi‐structured interviews with representatives from all hierarchy levels. We use mission statements from these hospitals to measure top management's strategic intent regarding frontline idea generation. Then we analyze the idea generation performance of 156 nurses from the hospitals and link it to specific middle management behaviors. The cross‐case analyses reveal that middle managers' shaping of nurses' innovation identity improves nurses' idea generation performance. However, this connection also means that middle managers' own forays into innovation can impede frontline idea generation. We find that middle managers' supportive behavior is largely independent of top management intent, a dynamic that offers both advantages and risks. These insights extend our knowledge about the role of middle managers in frontline idea generation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Temporal Patterns of New Product Introductions and IPO Value: The Importance of Recency, Dispersion, and Asymmetry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s innovation activity is often judged by the number and type of new products it launches, butwhenthese products are introduced may be equally important, especially before going public. This research investigates how the temporal pattern of new product introductions (NPIs) influences a firm’s initial public offering (IPO) value. The analysis uses data from 298 firms that went public between 2006 and 2023, and focuses on three patterns of timing: recency (how recently the latest product was launched before the IPO), dispersion (the degree to which NPIs before the IPO are spread out over time), and asymmetry (how disproportionately NPIs were launched over time before the IPO). Results demonstrate that firms with more dispersed NPIs achieve higher IPO value, whereas firms that introduce a product just before the IPO or introduce several new products disproportionately closer to the IPO tend to perform worse. Findings show that 1% increases in recency, dispersion, or asymmetry result in a 1.34% decrease, 3.65% increase, and 1.03% decrease, respectively, in IPO value, and these vary depending on the firm’s industry growth and product innovativeness. Results provide new insights for theory and practice, highlighting that innovation timing is a key determinant of IPO performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Psychological Ownership and Territorial Behaviors in Rental Transactions: Why “Who” You Rent from Matters</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The phenomenal growth in rentals, with the advent of access-based platforms, has made it possible for consumers to rent products from person providers (e.g., Alex on Airbnb) and company providers (e.g., Apex Vacations on Airbnb). But does “who” a consumer rents from matter? Across nine experiments (including one with real behaviors), we demonstrate that despite the product being the same, consumers differ in how they feel about the product depending on “who” they are renting from. Consumers feel stronger psychological ownership for the product when renting from company providers than person providers. These feelings of psychological ownership drive consumers to engage in “territorial” behaviors – actions that assert their claim on the rented product (e.g., moving furniture in a rental cabin). Consequently, consumers are more willing to exhibit such behaviors when renting from company providers than person providers. These behaviors impose real costs on rental providers through increased operational burdens and property damage, as exemplified through additional analyses of providers’comments on Airbnb’s community platform and interviews with providers. We further identify strategies to mitigate consumers’ territorial behaviors by altering consumers’ feelings of psychological ownership through its antecedent in the rental context: provider’s connection to the rental product.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Cryptocurrencies*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores U.S. public firms’ cryptocurrency holdings and accounting practices from 2013 to 2022 against the backdrop of the recently enacted crypto accounting rule, ASU 2023‐08. Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manipulated consumer reviews are a growing concern for digital platforms, undermining trust and distorting market outcomes. This study analyzes data from the Apple App Store to assess how both positive and negative manipulated reviews—later filtered by the platform—affect app sales rankings. Surprisingly, both one-star and five-star manipulated reviews initially boost app rankings, even when one-star reviews are intended to harm competitors. These effects can persist for weeks and take up to six months to reverse through platform filtering. Using text analysis, we find that negative manipulated reviews are linguistically more distinguishable from organic ones than are positive manipulated reviews, making them easier for consumers to spot. Our results show that review volume often outweighs valence in influencing consumer behavior, and that manipulated reviews have stronger effects on free apps, gaming apps, and apps from large developers. These findings underscore the urgency for platform managers to invest in faster, more accurate filtering systems, and highlight the need for policymakers to strengthen governance mechanisms to protect marketplace integrity and consumer trust.</content>

    <title>Transferring, Eliminating, or Both? The Strategic Impact of Resale Platforms and Consumer Learning on Coping with Consumer Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For sellers of experience goods, consumer uncertainty threatens profits. Resale platforms and enhanced consumer learning are popular tools to manage this uncertainty, but their impacts differ significantly and require tailored strategies. Our research reveals critical nuances overlooked by prior studies: the resale platform’s negative effect is often underestimated because of its indirect influence on consumer waiting behavior, whereas consumer learning can harm sellers of high-cost goods when consumers are impatient. Critically, the profitability and environmental outcomes depend on production costs and consumer patience. Encouraging consumer learning creates a profit-environment win–win with patient consumers, whereas resale platforms excel with impatient consumers and high costs. Combining both mechanisms benefits sellers only when consumers are patient and costs are moderate ([Formula: see text]"). Key strategic imperatives emerge: (i) resale behavior: encourage selectively (beneficial mainly for high-cost goods), minimizing resale discounts; (ii) learning behavior: nurture consumer patience and avoid rushing purchases, especially for premium goods; and (iii) product upgrades: avoid frequent, minor updates. Sellers must move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches, aligning their uncertainty management (resale, learning, upgrades) with product economics and consumer patience to optimize profits and sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study of nascent entrepreneurship lies at the core of entrepreneurship scholarship, offering critical insights into how both entrepreneurs and ventures emerge through a contextually embedded process. This review synthesizes findings from 95 peer-reviewed articles that employ the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), two comprehensive longitudinal datasets specifically focusing on nascent entrepreneurship. Using thematic analysis, we synthesize the literature into three core dimensions—the entrepreneur, the entrepreneurial process, and the venture—and emphasize the role of context. Although research on individuals and ventures is relatively well developed, the process dimension remains underexplored, and contextual influences warrant further investigation. We also identify key methodological challenges—particularly related to construct validity—as well as emerging methodological innovations. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, underscoring the need for more large-scale initiatives and opportunities to re-engage with the PSED’s untapped potential to advance understanding of entrepreneurial emergence.</content>

    <title>Founders’ Social Class Origin, Risk-Taking, and Venture Performance: A Bourdieusian Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study adopts a Bourdieusian lens to examine how founders’ social class origin influences venture performance through a central aspect of entrepreneurial habitus—risk-taking. In Study 1, we find that risk-taking mediates the relationship between social class origin and venture performance, advantaging those from higher social class origins. In an archival dataset, we show that an alternative measure of childhood social class similarly predicts risk-taking among self-employed individuals. In Study 2, we investigate how field-specific social capital moderates this pathway through founders’ social networks. These findings advance understanding of how early-life social class conditions shape entrepreneurial behavior and performance and imply the need for more nuanced and class-inclusive support within entrepreneurial ecosystems.</content>

    <title>Falling Behind: Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether the interplay of social comparisons in housing and rising income inequality contributed to the household debt boom in the United States between 1980 and 2007. We develop a tractable macroeconomic model with general social comparisons in housing to show that changes in the distribution of income affect aggregate housing demand, aggregate debt, and house prices if (and only if) social comparisons are asymmetric. In the empirically relevant case of upward-looking comparisons, rising inequality can rationalize a substantial share of the observed housing and debt boom.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce markup equilibrium—an extension of Walrasian equilibrium in which consumers pay a fixed percentage markup over producer prices. In quasilinear markets, markup equilibria exist despite nonconvexities. They are resource-feasible and envy-free, incur no budget deficit, and require little more communication and computation than ordinary Walrasian equilibrium. The associated markup mechanism is asymptotically incentive-compatible. We also introduce a Bound-Form First Welfare Theorem, which states that for any feasible allocation, the welfare loss compared to the first-best is bounded, using any price vector, by the sum of the resulting (i) budget surplus and (ii) rationing losses suffered by the participants. Using producer prices, this bound implies that any markup equilibrium with a small markup and few unallocated goods is nearly efficient.</content>

    <title>Auditor-provided nonpublic signals of misreporting and CFO dismissal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research suggests that board members value financial reporting quality because executive dismissal often follows low reporting quality events. However, inferences about the board’s demand for reporting quality in these studies are confounded by board members’ reputation incentives because the events examined are public (e.g., restatements). We investigate boards’ demand for reporting quality by exploiting aprivatesignal of misreporting: audit adjustments communicated to the Board by the external auditor. We first survey 29 audit committee chairs to understand whether boards use audit adjustments in their oversight of management and then conduct an empirical investigation to answer our research question. We find an increased likelihood of CFO dismissal following audit adjustments. This association is driven by adjustments that reduce income and by firms with better board oversight. These findings suggest that boards proactively use nonpublic signals of reporting quality and incorporate information from auditors into their monitoring function.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Facilitating Review Information Disclosure in the Platform Economy: Is More Accurate Always Better?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online consumer reviews (OCRs) publicly disclose consumer uncertainty about product valuations, enabling firms to acquire more accurate demand information. This paper develops a game-theoretic model in which a manufacturer sells products through both physical stores and a third-party online platform, which may operate in reselling or agency business modes. We investigate the interplay between OCR disclosure and business mode choices. We find that the manufacturer and the platform generally share aligned interests in OCR disclosure across business modes, with the information value of OCRs shaped by their accuracy and the uncertainty of consumers regarding product valuations. Specifically, OCR disclosure benefits both parties, yet it leads to higher gains for the manufacturer than the platform in the reselling mode, whereas their profit gains depend on the commission rate in the agency mode. When either consumer uncertainty about product valuations or the accuracy of OCRs is relatively low, both parties prefer the agency mode if the commission rate is moderate or the reselling mode if it is sufficiently high. When both consumer uncertainty about product valuations and the accuracy of OCRs are sufficiently high, both parties prefer the agency mode only if the commission rate is sufficiently high. Notably, the effects of OCR disclosure on the equilibrium business mode selection are non-monotonic: More accurate OCR disclosure facilitates the realization of an equilibrium business mode when the initial accuracy of OCRs is low and inhibits it when their accuracy is high. Last, we find that limited disclosure of OCRs and an endogenous commission rate can be employed as strategic tools to align business mode preferences. Our findings caution against the assumption that full OCR disclosure uniformly benefits platforms and manufacturers, and we offer practical insights for the design and operation of review systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dynamic Portfolio Allocation Under Market Incompleteness and Wealth EffectsIn the paper “Dynamic portfolio allocation under market incompleteness and wealth effects,” a novel decomposition of an optimal dynamic portfolio is developed under general incomplete-market models and the wealth-dependent hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility. It shows that with hedgeable interest rate risk, the optimal portfolio consists of two parts: a pure constant relative risk aversion optimal portfolio and a financing bond portfolio for investor future subsistence requirements. Under such a structure, the wealth growth rate is always higher for HARA investors with more initial wealth, leading to increased wealth inequality regardless of the underlying model dynamics and realized market scenario. Using the decomposition, the authors solve the HARA optimal policy in closed form under an incomplete-market model with both stochastic interest rate and volatility. The wealth effect in the optimal portfolio has interesting implications. It generates a procyclical pattern in investor stock positions and time-varying risk aversion levels as well as a “buy high, sell low” market timing effect that may hurt HARA investors with low initial wealth.</content>

A truthful equilibrium arises in which each firm highlights the more important attribute—even when at a disadvantage—but such an equilibrium does not exist without competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the estimation of dynamic economic models for which some of the state variables are observed only occasionally by the econometrician—a common problem in many fields, ranging from marketing to finance to industrial organization. If those occasional state observations are serially correlated, the likelihood function of the model becomes a high-dimensional integral over a nonstandard domain. We generalize the recursive likelihood function integration procedure to incorporate the occasional observations, enabling likelihood-based inference in such estimation problems. In extensive Monte Carlo studies, we demonstrate the favorable properties of the proposed method for identifying all model parameters and compare it to alternative methods.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lack of comovement between consumption differentials and real exchange rates is a traditional indicator of a disconnect of foreign exchange markets from economic fundamentals. We present novel empirical evidence for the disconnect between the volatilities, as opposed to the levels, of these variables. The volatility correlations are below one, but they are larger than the level correlations. We discuss the economics of volatility disconnect anomaly in settings with complete and incomplete markets and provide an explanation of our empirical findings based on international risk sharing of expected growth and volatility news shocks.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: Y.

    <title>Vaccines at Work: Experimental Evidence from a Firm Campaign</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health campaigns in firms could be a cost-effective approach to reduce sickness absence and to mitigate negative economic consequences of ill health among employees. Low participation rates, however, may prevent firms from realizing such private economic benefits. Moreover, employees may overestimate the effects of the campaign and engage in risky behaviors that could be detrimental to their health, thereby reducing the potential benefits of the intervention. We ran a natural field experiment with a bank in Ecuador, where we employed a randomized encouragement design by experimentally manipulating incentives to participate in a campaign to get vaccinated against influenza. This allows us to study the determinants of on-site vaccination and the consequences of increased participation in a firm campaign for employees, thereby informing about the private incentives for firms to run such interventions. Using rich administrative records merged with employee survey data, we find strong evidence that opportunity costs to participate in the campaign and peer behavior in the firm matter to increase vaccination take-up. Contrary to the firm’s expectation, increased participation in the campaign did not imply reduced sickness absence during the flu season. As we observe no relevant health benefits or externalities via coworker vaccination, our comprehensive analyses indicate that the campaign most likely was not economically beneficial for the firm. We discuss potential explanations for this result and present evidence consistent with the notion that a vaccination campaign can influence the behavior of employees concerning their health.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04908 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document a pecking order of transaction costs in the interdealer market for German sovereign bonds, where three trading protocols coexist. Dealers can trade over the counter (OTC), either bilaterally or via brokers, as well as on an exchange. Trading on the exchange is more expensive than OTC, and broker-intermediated trades are more costly than bilateral OTC trades. The existence of an OTC discount is difficult to square with theories centered around search-and-bargaining frictions but is in line with models of hybrid markets based on information frictions. Consistently, we show that dealers’ information impacts their choice of trading protocol and that the pecking order of transaction costs is aligned with the informational content of order flows across protocols. Search and bargaining as well as information proxies explain differences in OTC discount within protocols. A realistic description of hybrid markets thus requires both types of frictions.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: L. Pelizzon and M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the influence of supply chains on the transmission of financial shocks to firms’ innovation. Using matched Italian firm-bank data over the 2007–2017 period, we find that firms’ engagement in supply chains enhanced the resilience of innovation activities to the banking shock caused by the “twin financial crises” (Great Financial Crisis and sovereign debt crisis). The results suggest that, amid the banking shock, supply chains facilitated purchases of innovative intermediates through trade credit provision and helped to sustain firms’ joint research and development efforts. The estimates imply, however, that the support offered by supply chains did not extend to radical product advances.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03601 .</content>

    <title>It's Not Just What You Say, but How You Say It: The Effects of Enterprise Social Media on Service Management, Through the Lens of Signaling Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Frontline service workers are crucial to service delivery and have been a long‐standing focus of research, with scholars and practitioners alike maintaining an interest in their effective management. As technology increasingly transforms this context, the way in which managers in service organizations communicate with frontline workers has also evolved, with a notable increase in the use of enterprise social media (ESM). This study investigates the idea that it is not just ‘what’ management says (service‐oriented messaging) but ‘the way’ they say it (via ESM) that matters. Drawing on interviews with 36 informants and guided by signaling theory, this study explores how ESM influences customer‐focused signaling via management communication and HR implementation in the frontline service context, fostering conditions for a service climate. Findings reveal that ESM's affordances can potentially enhance service climate by strengthening HR system strength, promoting voice, and fostering informal leadership. However, risks such as manager role ambiguity, perceptions of mixed messaging, and over‐surveillance are also identified. This study highlights the double‐edged implications of ESM in its shaping of service‐oriented signaling and emphasizes the importance of the signaling environment in realizing its benefits while mitigating its risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances real options reasoning (ROR) logics by examining how entrepreneurs make sequential decisions under varying uncertainty. Although ROR has been conceptualized as a useful decision-making framework, its boundary conditions and theoretical applications remain underspecified. Through a multistage experimental design with 181 entrepreneurs and an archival study, we demonstrate that entrepreneurs employ different ROR logics based on both the initial level of uncertainty and its subsequent directional changes. This advances ROR by establishing its boundary conditions, demonstrating when entrepreneurs do and do not employ ROR logics, and revealing how the directionality and magnitude of uncertainty changes influence entrepreneurial decision-making.</content>

    <title>Core or periphery: Examining where to allocate heterogeneous inventors and the impact on firms' innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms should allocate their inventors to network locations to achieve their best innovation performance. We use an NK model to model the interactions between key factors that influence a firm's innovation: (a) individuals' embeddedness within the firm's network, (b) individuals' heterogeneity across their search distance as well as their adoption (i.e., imitation) propensity, and (c) the complexity of the firm's landscape. We find that in high‐complexity landscapes, firms benefit from allocating low‐adopter agents to the core and high‐adopters to the periphery, thereby promoting more independent search at the core. The opposite is true for low complexity landscapes. We further find that when agent types are unknown, individuals should be allocated based on their adoption propensity versus search distance.Managerial SummaryWhere should firms locate their heterogeneous inventors within their networks? Simulating a complex innovation landscape, our study focuses on the interaction of three essential factors that may influence firms' innovation: the location of inventors in the core (embedded position) or periphery of a firm's structure, the distance inventors search for solutions, and the adoption propensity with which inventors will imitate their peers' solutions versus being independent and following their own trajectory. Our results show that firms benefit by placing independent searchers who also search far at the core of the firm when facing highly complex problems, and at the periphery otherwise. Though search distance and adoption propensity have substitutive effects on innovation performance, firms should allocate based on inventors' adoption propensity to lower innovation‐performance variance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study repurchase options (repo contracts) in a competitive asset market with adverse selection. Gains from trade emerge from a liquidity need, but private information about asset quality prevents the full realization of trades. In equilibrium, a single repo contract pools all assets. The embedded repurchase option mitigates adverse selection by improving the volume of trades relative to outright sales. However, liquidity provision can be inefficiently low as lenders compete to attract high-quality assets via high haircuts and low rates. The equilibrium has a closed form and aligns well with empirical patterns across Mortgage-Backed Securities repos.</content>

    <title>To Each Their Own: Personalized Product Offerings in Competition</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study competition between two firms that personalize product offerings to consumers. Firms have private, imperfect signals of each consumer’s ideal location and offer each consumer a different product without observing the competitor’s product offering. We characterize the equilibrium personalization strategy and examine how the accuracies of firms’ signals affect equilibrium strategy, profits, and consumer welfare. A firm generally charges a higher price for a more niche product and profits more from niche consumers unless its prediction accuracy is sufficiently lower than its competitor’s. When both firms have the same industry-level prediction accuracy, an increase in accuracy initially relaxes but later intensifies price competition for niche consumers, having the opposite effect on mainstream consumers. Interestingly, equilibrium profits also have an inverse-U shape in the prediction accuracy. A higher accuracy can also decrease welfare for mainstream consumers. When firms can endogenously invest in prediction accuracy, firms have incentives to overinvest in equilibrium, resulting in a prisoner’s dilemma. Privacy regulations that reduce predictive accuracy, including industry self-regulation, could improve profits and hurt consumer welfare by relaxing price competition. Our results remain robust under consumer search. The paper also discusses what happens if firms charge uniform pricing, if consumers’ ideal locations are distributed on the Salop circle, or if firms receive common signals, highlighting price discrimination between mainstream and niche consumers as the key driver of results.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce formal measures for two psychological factors of probabilistic risk attitudes: attractiveness (motivational factor) and discriminability (cognitive factor). Unlike previous approaches that relied on heuristic proxies, our measures precisely capture these two fundamental factors. Our measures are mathematically tractable, robust to discontinuities, such as in the NEO-additive case, and flexible to be applied to any weighting function, as well as to both small and large probabilities. Additionally, through detailed numerical analysis, we examine to what extent existing weighting function parameters capture the two factors: attractiveness and discriminability. Finally, using these new measures, we provide a formal understanding of the independence between motivational and cognitive factors.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The research was made possible by the financial support from Brazilian Agency of Research and Innovation (Finep), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [Grants PROJ–CAPES PRINT 1033427P] and PUC-Rio.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04870 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Limit orders submitted around the same time are subject to random latencies and will be queued accordingly. In equilibrium, end-of-queue limit orders always lose money—the liquidity supply appears excessive. The model generates empirical predictions regarding such “overshooting” liquidity: (i) new limit orders appear fleeting—clustered submissions are followed by immediate cancellations, (ii) the resulting cancel-to-add count ratio reflects adverse selection, and (iii) the cancel-to-add size ratio measures high-frequency market-making activity. Welfare can be hurt by the overshooting liquidity if it induces excessive speculation. Overall, the model contributes to a more comprehensive understanding and better utilization of order book data.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03371 .</content>

    <title>Addressing Gender in Authenticity and Inclusion at Work: Nuancing Conservation of Resources Theory With Social Role Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we elucidate how gender may influence the mechanisms and conditions under which perceived inclusion climate facilitates authenticity at work. We nuance conservation of resources theory with social role theory to argue that perceived inclusion climate acts as a caravan passageway through which authenticity at work can be fostered, yet how inclusion climate relates to authenticity is different for men versus for women. We hypothesize that men will feel more authentic when they perceive their organization to be inclusive because such perceptions enable them to feel unique, whereas women will feel more authentic when in inclusive organizations because such environments foster their belongingness. In a time‐lagged study, we find that for women, it is belongingness that is the mediating process, whereas for men, it is both uniqueness and belongingness. We additionally propose, and find, that structural empowerment, as an HRM contextual resource caravan, moderates the relationships between perceived inclusion climate and belongingness/uniqueness for women but not for men. Here, structural empowerment is particularly important for women's needs for belongingness and uniqueness when they perceive their organization be not very inclusive. Overall, we contribute to workplace inclusion and authenticity literatures by underscoring the need to consider gender differences in more depth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professional house price forecast data are consistent with a rational model where agents must learn about the parameters of the house price growth process and the underlying state of the housing market. Slow learning about the long-run mean generates overreaction to forecast revisions and a modest response of forecasts to lagged realizations. Heterogeneity in signals and priors about the long-run mean helps the model account for cross-sectional dispersion in forecasts. Introducing behavioral frictions helps improve the model’s predictions for short-horizon overreaction and dispersion. Using a cross-section of forecasters and a term structure of forecasts are crucial for inference. (JEL C32, D84, G41, R32)</content>

    <title>Status-Amplified Deterrence: Paul Manafort’s Prosecution Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents often struggle to deter organizational deviance. We propose a theory of “status-amplified deterrence” wherein enforcement’s deterrent effects are amplified when carried out against high-status organizational actors. First, this enforcement is interpreted as willingness and ability for far-reaching enforcement. Next, amplified deterrence occurs as these episodes become widely known through (1) extensive media coverage and (2) the marketing efforts of third-party compliance advisors. We examine this theory in the context of the U.S. Department of Justice’s enforcement against Paul Manafort for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that enforcement against Manafort caused a widespread, sustained, and economically significant reduction in FARA noncompliance. We show supplementary evidence consistent with the idea that deterrence was amplified in significant part by media attention and by law firms referencing the episode while successfully marketing FARA advisory services. We contribute to literature illuminating how organizations, in conjunction with third-party compliance advisors, adjust deviant activities in response to shifting regulatory environments.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18754 .</content>

    <title>Rethinking the Value and Emission Implications of Green Bonds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our analysis of green bonds issued between 2013 and 2022 reveals a distinctive shareholder preference for such assets, particularly among financial institutions. In the secondary market, the green bonds issued by financial firms’ trade at a “greenium” of 8.2 basis points compared with matched samples, which is attributed potentially to the financial firms’ efforts in channeling funds to green loans. Past work documenting a positive stock price reaction to the issuance of green bonds is isolated to financial firms and to specific issuers. Issuers of green bonds with higher emissions before the green bond issue report an insignificant reduction in such emissions after issuance. Our analysis of the sustainable lending practices of these gatekeepers reveals that the greenium earned in the green bond market does not translate to the green loan market. Furthermore, the borrowers’ performance remains unchanged in the short term, indicating a lack of due diligence by the gatekeepers. This study underscores the complex relationship between financial markets and environmental stewardship.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial assistance from Columbia Business School, Fordham University, Harvard University (Program on Corporate Governance), and MIT Sloan (Sustainability Initiative).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00961 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Comparative Analysis of FLE Wellness Benefits and Customer Responsiveness: A Social Exchange Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the importance of frontline employees (FLEs) for organizations and consumers, it is important to motivate them to achieve optimal performance. One way to motivate FLEs is through employer-provided wellness benefits, which might increase FLEs’ responsiveness to customer needs. Building on social exchange theory, this research simultaneously examines five different wellness benefits to identify factors that can enhance FLEs’ feelings of being valued and an induced sense of indebtedness, which in turn can have downstream effects on customer responsiveness. The results of five studies, including a pilot study, preliminary sales study, field studies, and an internal meta-analysis, demonstrate how food and social benefits exert the strongest effects, with food yielding stronger direct effects on customer responsiveness and both showing indirect effects through value and indebtedness feelings. The next strongest effects are from mindfulness benefits. Physical and health wellness benefits exert the weakest downstream consequences. Importantly, if FLEs are in a supportive work environment, the effects of food and social benefits are enhanced. Conversely, job stressors and motivational constructs do not significantly impact the effects of employer-provided wellness benefits. By adopting the provided recommendations, retailers and service providers can institute effective and optimal wellness programs to enhance their FLEs’ customer-facing behaviors.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Glossy Premium: Effects of Product Glossiness on Consumer Judgments of First-Hand and Second-Hand Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers demonstrate a preference for products with glossy surfaces. This research examines how and why product glossiness influences consumers’ product preference in the first-hand versus second-hand markets. Six studies demonstrate that consumers generally prefer products with a glossy, as opposed to a matte, surface in both first-hand and second-hand markets. The preference for product glossiness is driven by the heightened recency (pristineness) perception of glossy products in the first-hand (second-hand) market. In addition, in line with these mechanisms, the positive effect of product glossiness on consumer preference is reversed for time-enhanced products (i.e., product quality and value improve with age) in the first-hand market and diminished when diagnostic prior product usage information is available to consumers in the second-hand market. Findings in this research contribute to a deeper understanding of visual marketing and product newness by verifying how visual glossiness induces two different interpretations of product newness in the first-hand and second-hand markets. This research offers practical implications for product design and presentation in the first-hand market, as well as refurbishing and resale strategies in the second-hand market, suggesting ways to communicate a consistent brand image and enhance product preference more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how deskilling technology (map apps) affects the choice of individuals to provide ride‐hail service. In a vignette experiment, technology increased participation in work by 8% and 4% among low‐ and high‐skill drivers respectively. Technology can increase participation by raising productivity or affording an amenity (reducing disutility of work). A field experiment revealed that the technology afforded more amenity to low‐skill drivers and they incurred more stress when driving without technology. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce wage pressures.Managerial SummaryTechnologies that deskill work may afford an amenity by reducing the disutility of work. In formulating technology strategy, managers must consider how the amenity varies by worker skill and how it affects the supply of labor. In the context of ride‐hail drivers, we show that navigation technology affords an amenity. The amenity is larger and the effect of technology on increasing labor supply is more pronounced among drivers with less skill. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce pressures for higher wages from low‐skilled workers.</content>

    <title>On the Optimal Design of a Financial Stability Fund</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of a Financial Stability Fund (the “Fund” henceforth) for a union of sovereign countries. By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.</content>

    <title>Complementarity in Future Selves: How Networks of Future-Oriented Cognitive Representations Influence Individuals’ Ability to Proactively and Adaptively Manage Their Career</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When thinking about one’s future work life and career with its seemingly endless possibilities, individuals rarely have a singular “put together” vision of their future self, in which all components neatly fit together. We investigate how the complementarity of a future self impacts an individual’s efforts to work toward their desired future career. We conceptualize and operationalize a future self as a network of future-oriented cognitive representations and complementarity as the extent of mutually beneficial connections in this network. We propose that future self complementarity amplifies the energizing effect of activated future self representations as it spreads across the network, enhancing vitality, and thus promoting proactive career behavior. In Study 1, we developed and validated a network-based measure to capture future self complementarity. In Study 2, we found, in a temporally lagged sample of 517 employees at 11 organizations, an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior through vitality. Study 3, a preregistered causal chain experiment, provided further support for this link. In Study 4, a preregistered field experiment, we again found an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior, assessed using a scale as well as a behavioral measure, via vitality.Funding: Financial support from a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency as part of the “Investissements d’Avenir” program [ANR-16-IDEX-008]; a grant from the Community for Learning &amp; Innovation at Erasmus University Rotterdam; and by the ESSEC Research Center is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18204 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern tech platforms provide workers real-time control over when they work and, increasingly, flexible pay: the option to be paid immediately after work. We investigate the labor supply effects of pay flexibility and the implications of present-biased preferences among gig-economy workers. Using granular data from a nationwide randomized controlled trial at Uber, we estimate the effects of switching from a fixed weekly pay schedule to Instant Pay, a system that allows on-demand, within-day withdrawals. We find that flexible pay substantially increased drivers’ work time. Furthermore, consistent with present bias, the response is significantly higher when drivers are further away from the end of their counterfactual weekly pay cycle. We discuss welfare and broader implications in contexts in which workers have the ability to flexibly supply labor.This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05301 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For products developed through a collaboration of specialized groups, success requires craft and engineering ingenuity from designers who focus on specific attributes, coupled with synchronized coordination between various design groups. Although shared work experience in the team—or familiarity—can improve coordination, it can deter creativity. We empirically study the impact of team familiarity on market performance of products by focusing on product development in the video game industry by coupling a granular database of development credits with sales data for video games. Although familiarity among coordinators has a positive effect on performance, familiarity among designers has a negative effect. Further, the positive (negative) effect of familiarity among coordinators (designers) is present even if familiarity is built through roles other than coordination (design). Overall, team familiarity is associated with a decrease in the product's market performance. Our results suggest that infusing fluidity in design roles and maintaining stability in coordination roles could improve the performance of new products.</content>

    <title>Situated Attention and Strategic Leadership Interfaces: The Role of CEO Humility and Digital Transformation Urgency for Corporate Venture Capital Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Integrating the attention‐based view with the strategic leadership interfaces perspective, we propose a theoretical model of situational urgency mechanisms influencing the allocation of CEOs' attention towards responsive actions. Specifically, we theorize upon the role of humility, which leads CEOs towards embracing interfaces and makes them particularly attentive to the situational context in which they operate. We test our theorization by studying corporate venture capital investments in digital ventures as a response to the situational urgency for digital transformation originating from multiple levels of analysis, internal and external to the firm. Testing a sample of 362 CEOs from 191 firms and 35 industries, we find support for the importance of CEO humility and the moderating role of the lack of top management team digital experience (team‐level urgency) and emerging digital competition (industry‐level urgency). Our study provides important insights into CEO responsiveness and advances our understanding of situated attention through the theorization of situational urgency and its integration with the strategic leadership interfaces perspective.</content>

    <title>The Robin Hood Effect in Transgressions Against Firms: How Political Ideology Shapes Consumer Justifications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer transgressions against firms involve moral violations in which consumers take advantage of loopholes in companies’ return and satisfaction-guaranteed policies or the lack of strict enforcement against password sharing, piracy, shoplifting, wardrobing, coupon stacking, promotion abuse, and fraud. Drawing on the timeless tale of Robin Hood, the legendary outlaw who stands up against injustice, the authors demonstrate that consumers use a Robin Hood justification to legitimize their transgressions against firms. Building on moral foundations theory, this research demonstrates that political ideology impacts consumers’ transgression behavior and the perceived morality of these practices. Six studies show that under certain conditions in which the moral virtues of fairness and care are cued, liberals are more likely to engage in transgressions than conservatives. The studies further test factors that can intensify or mitigate consumer transgressions against firms. Findings from this research can help marketers better understand how consumers justify transgressions and how to effectively reduce these costly and pervasive behaviors.</content>

    <title>Can Legal and Professional Personnel Selection Principles be Met With Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence)?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The purpose of this article is primarily to evaluate whether machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) can meet scientific, professional, and legal principles of personnel selection based on the rapidly accumulating research literature in Human Resource Management (HRM). It does so by addressing a series of questions in terms of what is known in the current research literature on these principles and related topics and by proposing a research agenda for what else needs to be studied. The review shows that there is enough current scientific evidence on the value of ML to support its use. ML tools are able to meet the basic principles of personnel selection and better meet many other very important principles. In addition, ML for personnel selection decisions is not a “black box” and can be understood and explained. It does not increase the legal risks from hiring, although it may require some additional steps in a few jurisdictions. There are uses of ML in selection that most organizations should be considering. Customized procedures will require good data, but generic vendor products may also serve some needs. Additional expertise may be required of HRM professionals, but not necessarily at a high level that would require new staffing or consultant expense. The availability of large language models (LLMs) may render unproctored remote assessments vulnerable to cheating, and all narrative candidate information provided in the future susceptible to AI‐generated text, resulting in more questions than research answers at this stage. The article ends with practical and theoretical implications for the use of ML in selection.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our paper examines analyst reports and online stock opinion articles that recommend buying stocks which, based on the literature, trade at high prices and earn low future returns (“short-leg securities”). Using a textual analysis, we test whether the justifications primarily (1) emphasize safe-haven qualities, (2) indicate exuberance, or (3) highlight lottery-like features. Our results strongly point to (3). We subsequently validate our text-based inferences through a survey of institutional and retail investors with long positions in short-leg securities. Overall, perceived upside potential appears to play a material role in driving investor demand for stocks in the short legs of anomalies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Binsbergen, Han, and Lopez-Lira (2023) predict analysts’ forecast errors using a random forest model. A strategy that trades against this model’s predictions earns a monthly alpha of 1.54% (t-value = 5.84). This estimate represents a large improvement over studies using classical statistical methods. We attribute the difference to a look-ahead bias. Removing the bias erases the alpha. Linear models yield as accurate forecasts and superior trading profits. Neither alternative machine learning models nor combinations thereof resurrect the predictability. We discuss the state of research into the term structure of analysts’ forecasts and its causal relationship with returns. (JEL G12, G31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study depositor behavior and capital flight using data from the Freedman’s Savings Bank, a bank established after the U.S. Civil War to support formerly enslaved individuals. White depositors, who generally had better access to financial information, begin providing significant funding as interest terms are enhanced. They respond faster to postpanic stabilization efforts and negative bank-specific information, and are twice as likely to close accounts before failure, passing expected losses to Black depositors, who were the bank’s primary philanthropic target. Our results show how demand deposit funding of bank-like institutions can create systemic disadvantages for less experienced borrowers. (JEL G530, N20, O160)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an equilibrium corporate bond pricing model that accommodates the heterogeneity in institutional investors’ preferences and mandates in an empirically tractable way. Our model, estimated on rich holdings data, quantifies investors’ preferences and demand elasticities, with inelastic insurers focusing on the investment-grade segment, and elastic mutual funds substituting across ratings groups. The model offers a novel quantitative perspective of the effect of recent trends in institutional ownership on equilibrium credit spreads and the funding costs of corporations. Overall, our model emphasizes the composition of institutional demand as an important state variable for corporate bond pricing. (JEL G11, G12, G21, G22, G23, G24)</content>

    <title>Cost-Saving Synergy: Energy Stacking in Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the great potential benefits of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to electrical grids, most standalone uses of BESS are not economical due to batteries’ high upfront costs and limited lifespans. Energy stacking, a strategy of providing two or more services with a single BESS, has been of great interest to improve profitability. However, some key questions, for example, the underlying mechanism by which stacking works or why and how much it may improve profitability, remain unanswered in the literature. Using two popular battery services, we analytically show that there often exists cost-saving synergy—the cost of performing both services at the same time (simultaneous stacking) is smaller than the sum of individual costs if we had performed each service alone—which allows for bigger profits. Furthermore, we perform comparative statics on the optimal mix of the services to systemically characterize grid/market conditions that maximize/minimize this synergy. We also derive a theoretical upper bound on simultaneous stacking’s benefits, showing that it can approximately double the profit of the best standalone service. Several generalizations of the base model not only show that the main lessons continue to hold but also that stacking’s benefits may become even stronger.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03477 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of information technologies has intensified concerns about individual privacy and highlighted the importance of consumer privacy rights. At the same time, these technologies enable significant personalization of communications and offerings. We develop a theory of the effects of privacy based on the concavity of an individual’s derived payoff function with respect to market beliefs: When this function is concave, privacy is valuable. We identify market conditions that lead to concavity or convexity in the derived payoff function. The framework is applied to contexts such as product choice, price discrimination, data breaches, and health insurance.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the social capital embedded in employees’ networks contributes to firm performance. Using novel, individual-level network data, we measure a firm’s social capital derived from employees’ connections with external stakeholders. Our directed network data allow for differentiating those connections that know the employee and those that the employee knows. Results show that firms with more employee social capital perform better; the positive effect stems primarily from employees being known by others. We provide causal evidence exploiting the enactment of a government regulation that imparted a negative shock to networking with specific sectors and provide evidence on the mechanisms.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: D.

    <title>Vestigial Tails? Floor Brokers at the Close in Modern Electronic Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The closing auction is an increasingly important trade mechanism due to the rise of passive funds that require closing price execution. We study differences in auction mechanism design on NYSE and Nasdaq that may affect closing price efficiency. Unlike Nasdaq, NYSE allows late auction orders through its floor brokers, providing traders with more flexibility to mitigate or create large last-minute auction imbalances. Price changes in the closing auction are more likely to reverse on NYSE compared with Nasdaq, suggesting greater price inefficiency in NYSE closing auctions. Larger last-minute abnormal imbalances on NYSE, particularly in stocks where auction competition may be inhibited by relatively high floor broker auction fees, explain these stronger reversals. Evidence from the NYSE floor closure during the COVID-19 pandemic supports a causal interpretation. Our results highlight an important tradeoff between auction flexibility and price efficiency.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00884 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build cross‐sections of asset returns for a given set of characteristics, that is, managed portfolios serving as test assets, as well as building blocks for tradable risk factors. We use decision trees to endogenously group similar stocks together by selecting optimal portfolio splits to span the stochastic discount factor, projected on individual stocks. Our portfolios are interpretable and well diversified, reflecting many characteristics and their interactions. Compared to combinations of dozens (even hundreds) of single/double sorts, as well as machine‐learning prediction‐based portfolios, our cross‐sections are low‐dimensional yet have up to three times higher out‐of‐sample Sharpe ratios and alphas.</content>

    <title>Surviving as a Vegan in a World of Omnivores: Relational Fractures in Shared Practices</title>
    <updated>2025-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research documents the role of the misalignment of practice elements in practice habituation and change. We extend this literature by demonstrating the understudied role of practice relationality. Locating our empirical work in veganism, a context that encompasses a bundle of interrelated practices, we show how people who adopt veganism manage the relationality of their food-related practices (e.g., eating, cooking, and shopping for food) during shared moments. Building on interview, secondary, and netnographic data on people who pursue veganism, we demonstrate that changes in shared practice performances cause relational fractures. We pinpoint relational fractures that hinder practitioners from smoothly performing shared practices in three contexts: co-performance, co-learning, and the marketplace. To repair practice relationality, vegan consumers enact four relational competences, which we identify as decoding, decoupling, divesting, and chameleoning. These competences can repair some relational fractures while aggravating others. When vegan consumers fail to acquire any competence, however, they end up reverting to their old omnivorous performances. Our paper contributes to practice theory by conceptualizing the role of practice relationality in practices, introducing the concept of relational competence as a necessary element for performance (re)rehabituation, and demonstrating the role of practice intelligibility in the co-performance of shared practices.</content>

    <title>Concealing Prices: How Delayed Price Disclosure Influences Consumer Purchase Decisions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article presents the first systematic empirical investigation into a longstanding question in retail: Is it better to display prices upfront or reveal them later in the purchase process? Two large-scale field studies demonstrate that delayed price disclosure can either increase or decrease sales. Supporting lab studies reveal that one plausible explanation is that a price delay allows price beliefs to shift consumers’ internal reference prices upward or downward, creating either positive or negative price expectation disconfirmations when prices are revealed. When consumers anticipate prices should be expensive (e.g., from premium brands or upscale stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations upward, making purchases more likely when prices are revealed. Conversely, when consumers anticipate prices should be inexpensive (e.g., sales events or discount stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations downward, making purchases less likely when prices are revealed. Our findings offer retailers actionable insights on when to reveal prices to customers. In doing so, the authors contribute to the literature on price obfuscation and challenge the conventional wisdom that shopping experiences should always minimize friction. (184 words)</content>

    <title>Strategic (Inconsistent) Disclosures and Sophisticated Investors: Evidence from Hedge Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent SEC regulations require that qualified hedge fund advisers provide their investors with narrative disclosures of their business and operations. We find that 40% of these disclosures omit or de‐emphasize information regarding advisers' operational and investment risks when compared to other sources of public information. Funds with such “inconsistencies” are associated with predictably lower fund performance but do not differ in their fund flows, flow‐performance relation, ownership structure, or management fees. These results are consistent with investors being subject to limited strategic thinking, which prevents them from fully unraveling the implications of strategic omissions. This, in turn, contributes to advisers' successful use of discretion to de‐emphasize information with adverse performance implications. Our findings suggest that information processing frictions can facilitate nondisclosure, even in markets with sophisticated investors.</content>

    <title>Is Prevention Better Than Cure? Effects of Cyber Risk Disclosures on Shareholder Response to Breaches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As digitalization increases firms’ exposure to cyber risks, corporate disclosures about how these risks are managed are becoming more common and influential. This study examines 1,912 breach incidents affecting public companies to understand how shareholder reactions differ depending on the type of cyber risk strategies disclosed. We find that, although breaches generally lead to stock price declines, firms that previously disclosed preventive strategies, such as efforts to avoid breaches, experience significantly smaller losses in market value. Conversely, disclosing mitigative strategies, focused on damage control after a breach, amplifies the negative impact. These effects arise from shareholders’ loss aversion: They respond more favorably to firms perceived as trying to prevent harm rather than simply reacting to it. These findings suggest that managers should focus cyber risk disclosures on credible, prevention-oriented strategies to build investor confidence and minimize financial fallout after a breach. Additionally, our findings advise against using cyber risk disclosures as tools for impression management. Managers should ensure these disclosures accurately reflect the firm’s cyber risk management practices, as failing to do so can undermine the economic benefits of emphasizing preventive strategies.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: On Value-at-Risk Based Queueing Systems</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we investigate the economics of queueing systems with strategic non-risk-neutral customers, emphasizing the value-at-risk (VaR) framework. It is distinct from the moment-based utility structure of Naor’s model by introducing the maximum loss customers can bear with a certain level of confidence. Such systems are ubiquitous in various domains involving human customers, such as healthcare or security check queues, wherein risk-based performance measures take precedence and hold greater significance. We consider both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases of risk preferences under different information levels. Our findings demonstrate that optimal strategies in observable queueing systems with non-risk-neutral customers exhibit threshold-type behaviors that differ significantly from those observed in risk-neutral customer settings. For unobservable queueing systems, we derive an equilibrium joining probability for homogeneous risk preferences and a multi-dimensional equilibrium joining probability for heterogeneous risk preferences. Interestingly, under the VaR criterion, there is an indifferent action region in the observable queueing model. Customers with risk preferences falling within this region will adopt the same joining strategy. And, in the unobservable scenario, there is an indifference curve for risk preference. Customers on the same indifference curve have the same level of risk preference. Furthermore, we provide a conversion formula that facilitates comparison between two risk preferences with different confidence levels. When exploring social welfare, we use conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to characterize the customer’s excessive losses that lead to potential negative social utility. To distinguish from the classic social welfare function, we term our proposed social welfare function the “CVaR-Based Extended SocialWelfare Function (CVaR-ESW)”. In observable systems with homogeneous risk preferences, the socially optimal CVaR-ESW-based risk preference falls within a “ribbon” region, while in unobservable systems, it forms a curve. We also uncover intriguing insights about the information disclosure. In unobservable situations, the throughput in the model with naively-assessed (NA) customers is always greater than that in the model with precisely-assessed (PA) customers. Based on the differences in risk tolerance values among customers with different risk preferences, we found that, under certain circumstances, NA customers can generate more social welfare, while in other cases, the opposite is true. Overall, this research sheds light on the interplay between VaR-based queueing economics, risk preferences, and strategic customer behavior.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Manufacturer Encroachment in the Presence of Production Economies of Scale</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well established that a manufacturer generally benefits from encroachment with a profitable direct channel and may also benefit from using encroachment as a threat (i.e., without sales in the direct channel); the retailer may also benefit from both encroachment strategies. Our study provides new insights into the manufacturer encroachment literature by considering the upstream manufacturer’s production economies of scale. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that an increasing level of economies of scale may reduce the manufacturer’s profit if the manufacturer encroaches. Furthermore, we find that under strong economies of scale, refraining from encroachment may be the optimal strategy, even if encroachment could increase the manufacturer’s wholesale profit. This finding suggests that a manufacturer may choose not to encroach solely due to profit losses in direct selling. Interestingly, we also find that the manufacturer can benefit from encroachment by maintaining an unprofitable direct channel with sales, provided that the level of economies of scale is below a threshold. Moreover, our findings reveal that the retailer can benefit from manufacturer encroachment only when the level of economies of scale remains below this threshold, and that an increasing level of economies of scale reduces the likelihood that the retailer can benefit.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Don’T Follow RL Blindly: Lower Sample Complexity of Learning Optimal Inventory Control Policies with Fixed Ordering Cost</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the sample complexity of offline learning for a class of structured MDPs describing the inventory control system with fixed ordering cost/setup cost, a fundamental problem in supply chains. We find that a naive plug-in sampling-based approach applied to the inventory MDPs leads to strictly lower sample complexity bounds compared to the optimal bounds recently obtained for the general MDPs. More specifically, in the infinite-horizon discounted cost setting, we obtain anO~(min{(S¯−s_)2(1−γ)2ε2,1(1−γ)4ε2})sample complexity bound, where(S¯−s_)2corresponds to the number of state-action pairs in a generic MDP with state spaceSand action spaceA. As such,O~((S¯−s_)2(1−γ)2ε2)improves on the optimal generic RL boundΘ~((S¯−s_)2(1−γ)3ε2)(when directly applyingΘ~(|S||A|(1−γ)3ε2)here) by a factor of(1−γ)−1, andO~(1(1−γ)4ε2)is able to completely remove the dependence on state and action cardinality. In the infinite-horizon average cost setting, we obtain anO~((S¯−s_)2ε2)bound, improving on the generic optimal RL boundΘ~((S¯−s_)2tmixε2)(when directly applyingΘ~(|S||A|tmixε2)here) by a factor oftmix, and hence removing the mixing time dependence. By carefully leveraging the structural properties of the inventory dynamics in various settings, we are able to improve on those “best-possible” bounds developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. Our results demonstrate the drawbacks one could face by blindly following RL algorithms and the necessity of designing sample efficient algorithms that properly incorporate the special structures of the inventory systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In practice, new entrants often bypass intermediary retailers and engage in direct competition against incumbents. However, this might place entrants under the burden of integration costs. This paper models the strategic interactions between an incumbent and an entrant, taking into account the integration cost incurred by the entrant and the associated estimation bias exhibited by the incumbent. In the baseline setting with an unbiased incumbent, we find that the entrant’s higher integrative capability (i.e., lower integration cost) always hurts the incumbent, and can even hurt the entrant itself. We then investigate how the incumbent’s estimation bias affects firm performance, and find that increasing the bias can actually benefit the entrant and, intriguingly, the incumbent as well. In particular, a mutually beneficial situation can emerge where a higher level of bias potentially improves profits for both the incumbent and the entrant. Additionally, we extend our analysis to settings with random integration costs, where the bias can be linked to either the mean or the variance of these costs. Our findings offer practical implications for entrants in choosing their integrative capability strategy, and for incumbents in deciding whether to pursue bias reduction.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Incentives for Information Revelation in a Supply Chain and the Bullwhip Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Getting downstream firms in a supply chain to share private information about consumer demand with their suppliers is generally considered a prerequisite to dampening the bullwhip effect, i.e., the amplification of demand shocks as they pass upstream in a supply chain. If downstream firms are reluctant to share their demand information, how can they best be incentivized to do so, and what does the optimal incentive scheme imply for the bullwhip effect and supply chain efficiency? We examine these questions by developing a supply chain model with asymmetric information, and show that the supplier should optimally follow a two-pronged strategy. One prong consists of the optimal incentive contract to induce information revelation. Information revelation requires a distortion in the downstream firm’s orders that makes them more responsive to demand shocks, which tends to strengthen the bullwhip effect. The other prong helps to reduce this distortion and dampen the bullwhip effect. It consists of getting the downstream firm to increase its initial order and stock up on inventory before it learns about demand. A larger initial order is sufficient to eliminate the bullwhip effect if demand shocks are not too persistent. Our results hold if the marginal production cost does not increase too quickly with output and the inventory holding cost is not too high.</content>

    <title>Creating Radical Technologies and Competencies: Revisiting Interorganizational Dynamics in the Nascent Bionic Prosthetic Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why were incumbents able to pioneer and dominate the nascent bionic prosthetic industry, even though entrants represented the majority of the firms investing in this radical technology? To answer this question, our abductive study builds on the novel base principles definition and uses a historical approach to investigate the incubation and early commercialization periods (1974–2018) of bionic prosthetics. We use comprehensive quantitative data on all technological entrants and historical analysis of significant firms to reveal that organizational prehistory affects both the knowledge and intent of technological entrants. Start-ups, incumbents in conventional prosthetics, and established firms in other industries created and integrated subtechnologies into a radical system. Although all firms invested in component technologies, incumbents played a key role as system integrators. Incumbents dominated product commercialization; start-ups captured value through alliances or by being acquired, and established firms in other industries leveraged their knowledge in adjacent value chains as a function of their prior histories and intents. In comparing the virtues of our explanation—the creating radical systems effects—with widely accepted alternative explanations, we develop a more generalized framework of interorganizational dynamics in nascent industries as an endogenous, coevolutionary process that goes beyond explanations that privilege competitive dynamics to also include collaborative dynamics in value creation (and capture).Funding: This paper was funded by the Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets at the University of Maryland, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Strategic Research Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16915 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how market uncertainty impacts the liquidity premium through a demand-side channel. I find that equity mutual funds actively increase the liquidity of their portfolios in response to increased redemptions during market stress. Liquidity preservation is more intense for funds more exposed to strategic complementarities. I show that a stock’s relative illiquidity within a fund’s portfolio is a key determinant in flow-induced rebalancing decisions, whereby funds follow a liquidation “pecking order.” This “flight-to-liquidity” is associated with increases in the liquidity premium and affects individual stocks’ reversal performance: Stocks held by more fragile funds and those with higher illiquidity ranks within funds’ portfolios experience greater returns to liquidity provision during market stress.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02095 .</content>

    <title>Infrastructure Investment with Public and Private Product Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private firms often develop new products by utilizing substantial infrastructure investments made by government agencies. We construct a mixed oligopoly model to study the interactions between the government’s infrastructure quality decision and the subsequent public and private product development decisions. We have five main results: First, the government permits firm entry in the product market only when the firm is sufficiently more efficient at product development than the government. With firm entry, the government invests more in developing infrastructure because the firm’s presence increases the government’s return on investment in infrastructure. Second, the quality received by the consumer might improve or worsen in the presence of a private firm, depending on the relative product development efficiency as well as the cost of infrastructure development. Third, private presence can lead to a significant reduction in consumer surplus, especially at the lower end of the market. This happens when infrastructure investment cost is high, because the small increase in infrastructure quality with firm entry is not enough to compensate for the reduction in the government’s product quality. Fourth, depending on the relative product development efficiency of the private firm, the government might implement policies that prevent the private firm from entering the market. Finally, there exist circumstances under which private presence can be beneficial in that it leads to products that not only enhance social welfare but also improve overall consumer surplus.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: S.

    <title>Using Social Recognition to Address the Gender Difference in Volunteering for Low-Promotability Tasks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows that women volunteer significantly more for tasks that people prefer others to complete. Such tasks carry little monetary incentives because of their very nature. We use a modified version of the volunteer’s dilemma game to examine if nonmonetary interventions, particularly social recognition, can be used to reduce the gender gap associated with such tasks. We conduct a laboratory experiment with three treatments where (a) a volunteer receives positive social recognition, (b) a nonvolunteer receives negative social recognition, and (c) a volunteer receives positive social recognition but a nonvolunteer receives negative social recognition. Our results indicate that social recognition increases the overall probability that an individual volunteers. Positive social recognition reduces the gender gap observed in the baseline treatment, and so does the combination of positive and negative social recognition. These findings suggest that public recognition of volunteering for such tasks can change the default gender norms in organizations and increase efficiency simultaneously.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was primarily funded by the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore [Seed Grant 7399FW].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04017 .</content>

    <title>Transforming Recruitment and Selection Practices in Organizations Through Discriminative and Generative &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Adoption: A Structuration Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically impacted human decision‐making, productivity, and human agentic role delivery, thereby transforming HRM practices, particularly in recruitment and selection. Traditional recruitment and selection methods involve the dynamic interplay of structure and human agents. This interplay is changing with the emergence of human‐technology‐conjoined agencies that share task delivery and role performance responsibilities, thereby altering and creating new recruitment and selection routines. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 43 HR and talent acquisition leaders in a high‐growth emerging market context to understand the transformational role of discriminative and generative AI technology agencies in changing recruitment and selection practices. This study contributes to existing HRM literature by demonstrating the impact of discriminative and generative AI in recruitment and selection and the simultaneous human‐AI collaboration and algorithmic management of humans emerging as a consequence. Furthermore, we theorize the transformational changes in structures and processes across the entire recruitment and selection process emerging from conjoined agencies.</content>

    <title>Ecosystem synergies as drivers of acquisitions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the structure of ecosystems shapes firms’ acquisition choices. We develop a theoretical framework comprising three levels of ecosystem structure – local interdependence, clusters, and centrality – that could drive choices of M&amp;A targets based on expected ecosystem synergies, a previously undocumented acquisition synergy that creates benefits for the acquirer and the ecosystem overall. Ecosystem synergy is value created through combination of the acquirer and target's ecosystem positions that improves the combined firm's alignment with third‐party complementors. Such synergies manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of the firms’ components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. In the setting of the e‐commerce technology industry, our results show that firms acquire targets to increase local interdependence of their components and their presence in component clusters.Managerial SummaryInnovation ecosystems are critical for firms’ performance. While prior research has established the importance of ecosystems and firms’ positioning within ecosystems, we do not actually know whether and how ecosystem structure shapes firms’ acquisition choices. In this article, we show that M&amp;A targets are not chosen solely for the value created by the acquirer or target, but also for their broader ecosystem synergies. Ecosystem synergies are a previously undocumented acquisition synergy (distinct from internal synergies and market power) that manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of firms’ post‐acquisition components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. We test our theory by mapping the ecosystem structure of 6187 technological components that drives 186 acquisitions in the e‐commerce technology sector during the period 2013 to 2021.</content>

    <title>Normalizations and Misspecification in Skill Formation Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important class of structural models studies the determinants of skill formation and the optimal timing of interventions. In this paper, I provide new identification results for these models and investigate the effects of seemingly innocuous scale and location restrictions on parameters of interest. To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without these additional restrictions and show that important policy-relevant parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact the interpretation of parameters and may affect counterfactuals. Importantly, with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions fix identified parameters and lead to misspecification. Consequently, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables might yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I show how existing estimators can easily be adapted to solve these issues. As a byproduct, this paper also presents a general and formal definition of when restrictions are truly normalizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many online platforms like ride-sharing or grocery delivery, some demand agents can wait for a short period of time for a service if they are assured of its eventual provision within an acceptable delay. We study these “partially patient” agents in the context of an online resource allocation problem, contrasting them with impatient agents who require immediate service. We utilize a relaxed notion of competitive ratio, known as the resource/feature augmented competitive ratio, allowing online algorithms to benefit from additional features not available to the optimal offline algorithm. We introduce a class of polytope-based resource allocation (POLYRA) algorithms that achieve optimal or near-optimal competitive ratios by consulting specific polytopes and maintaining feasible algorithm states within these polytopes. For two or three types of agents, these algorithms can achieve the optimal competitive ratio. For more than three types, we present a near-optimal nested POLYRA algorithm that secures at least 80% of the optimal ratio. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical analysis, highlighting the efficiency of our algorithms beyond adversarial arrivals and the modified competitive ratio framework.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03335 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Enterprise risk management (ERM) is an institutional agenda emphasizing holistic risk oversight and strategic planning. This study examines whether and how the adoption of ERM affects management earnings forecasts. We first document that ERM adoption increases the likelihood and accuracy of management earnings forecasts. We then provide evidence that ERM adoption improves forecast quality by reducing the volatility of fundamentals and enhancing managers’ ability to assess both internal and external information. Finally, we find that the positive effect of ERM in improving forecast accuracy is more pronounced for long-horizon forecasts, consistent with ERM’s long-term strategic focus. Collectively, our results shed light on how ERM adoption improves the quality of a key voluntary disclosure—management forecasts.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <title>Displaying and Discounting Perishables: Impact on Retail Profits and Waste</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical studies have shown that consumers’ purchasing behavior depends on product display, that is, how products are organized on store shelves. We explore how a retailer selling a perishable product with deteriorating quality over time can optimize product display and the discounting of soon-to-expire units to maximize profit and reduce waste. Specifically, we consider a product with a finite shelf life that is replenished periodically. The retailer optimizes the product display setting, the discount rate and timing, as well as the order quantity in each replenishment cycle. We assume that the length of the replenishment cycle is such that, at most, two different product ages can coexist on the store shelves, and we refer to these two groups of products as the fresh batch and the old batch. We show that, when the store traffic is deterministic, only the following two policies can be optimal: (i) discarding unsold units at each replenishment epoch, so that there is only one product batch on the shelves at all times, or (ii) keeping and discounting unsold old batch units but making the fresh batch units more accessible to consumers. In contrast, when the store traffic is stochastic, all possible strategies can be optimal, as waste becomes unavoidable. In particular, the optimal strategy depends on the characteristics of the product, store, and consumers. Our numerical results indicate that, compared with a benchmark where units from the fresh and old batch are equally accessible and no discount is offered, optimizing the display and the discount results in an average increase in profit of 6.01% and a decrease in (relative) waste of 21.24%.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00316 .</content>

    <title>Does the Locker Alliance Network Improve Last Mile Delivery Efficiency?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Locker Alliance Network (LAN), a cutting-edge initiative under Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, aims to revolutionize parcel pickup processes. This government-led project seeks to implement two major changes in Singapore’s urban logistics: (i) establishing an open-access facility for all logistic service providers (LSPs) and (ii) enhancing the last mile delivery efficiency of each LSP, thereby reducing its operational footprint. This research investigates the impact of locker network design on the delivery efficiency of individual LSPs and explores strategies for the government to construct an inclusive network for all LSPs. Our study explores two operational modes: the two-trip mode, in which home and locker deliveries are managed separately, and the mixed-trip mode, which consolidates both into one route. We extend the Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley theorem to estimate the delivery trip length to remaining home locations, assuming consumers can choose between locker pickup or home delivery. This enables us to explicitly formulate the LAN design problem as a nonlinear optimization model. Furthermore, our models for both operational modes reveal that optimal locker network design tends to expand in a nested manner relative to the market share of an LSP. This finding suggests that governments could design locker networks based on the profiles of the largest LSP, ensuring that the expansion of these networks aligns with the existing logistics infrastructure. Leveraging data from LAN’s pilot program in Singapore, our research underscores the pivotal role of network design in last mile delivery efficiency. A poorly designed locker network can inadvertently reduce productivity by increasing the length of delivery trips, thus negating the potential benefits of the system. In contrast, an optimized network can mitigate this negative impact on delivery efficiency. Beyond network design, low customer adoption emerges as another critical bottleneck. Our findings show that, as more customers shift to locker pickup, especially in mixed-trip modes, delivery efficiency improves. Therefore, network design and a higher adoption rate of locker pickup are key to LAN’s success. The government’s role in driving deeper customer engagement, alongside efforts to optimize network design and delivery operations, is vital to unlocking the full potential of this smart nation initiative.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72422006], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16210720, 16500423], the 2019 Academic Research Fund Tier 3, the Ministry of Education, Singapore [Award MOE-2019-T3-1-010], and the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China [Grant CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX1667].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04567 .</content>

    <title>How Hybrid Work Shapes Communication Ties: The Role of Concern about Relationship Loss and Organizational Identification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid shift to hybrid work settings has raised concerns about decreased workplace interactions and communication ties. Based on Need‐to‐Belong Theory, this study extends previous research by adopting the concept of ‘concern about relationship loss’ to explore when and how hybrid work leads to the retention of work‐related communication ties. Our research, comprising a quasi‐experimental study and a pre‐registered replication, both conducted in the US, shows that hybrid work increases worries about the potential loss of work‐related relationships (‘concern about relationship loss’). This concern prompts employees to engage in proactive interpersonal and organizational citizenship behaviours (OCBs), but only when organizational identification is high. Notably, the impact of hybrid work and organizational identification is more pronounced for retaining existing communication ties than for losing or forming new ones. Our findings underscore the need to differentiate between concerns about relationship loss and actual isolation. They also emphasize the active role of employees in maintaining communication ties, highlighting the importance of organizational identification and OCBs. This study extends the conventional view of hybrid workers as passive towards a more dynamic understanding of how employees navigate work‐related communication challenges in hybrid work settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize optimal mutual fund risk-taking strategies in competitive multi-period tournaments among multiple players. With multiple competitors, every player begins by taking maximum risk. In the final period, all players continue to take maximum risk except the leading player, who employs a “lock-in” strategy that depends on the magnitude of the lead. Our theory predicts the leader should strategically lock in advantage by reducing risk-taking if and only if the lead is great enough, rather than an increase in risk-taking by the trailers to try to catch up. Empirical evidence from style-adjusted mutual fund tournaments provides strong and robust support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing use of algorithmic management (AM) in human resource (HR) activities has attracted growing attention from HR scholars, as organizations increasingly rely on digital labor platforms to leverage external workers. This study examines how these platforms apply AM in human resource management (HRM) and how these algorithmic systems embed both market and hierarchy management principles for shaping worker control and autonomy. Specifically, we seek to examine how AM manifests in two distinct ways across these platforms: one involving hierarchy and control, and another involving matching and autonomy. Using an inductive qualitative design, we analyzed 33 semi‐structured interviews with platform workers and documentary data from 23 digital labor platforms. Whereas prior research often frames AM in binary terms—that is, market/autonomy versus hierarchy/control—we explore how task characteristics influence the joint application of both market and hierarchy principles in AM for HRM activities of digital labor platforms. Our findings show how platforms dynamically calibrate market and hierarchy approaches to AM in response to task demands, balancing flexibility, oversight, discretion, and incentives. For HR scholars, this study highlights the flexible and conditional nature of AM systems that blend autonomy and control in nuanced ways. By moving beyond the dominant autonomy‐versus‐control dichotomy, we show how AM is configured to align with diverse forms of work across platforms, enhancing efficiency while sustaining worker engagement amid evolving task demands.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how a domestic venture capital (VC) firm’s syndication experience with reputable foreign VC firms improves its likelihood of achieving successful exits for entrepreneurial firms that it subsequently funds. We identify two complementary theoretical mechanisms: (a) domestic VC firms can gain certification from reputable foreign VC firms that improves access to superior investment opportunities and (b) they can learn from reputable foreign VC firms to better select and nurture ventures. Furthermore, the positive impact of syndication experience is particularly pronounced in facilitating exits for portfolio companies in foreign countries. Our findings highlight the enduring benefits that domestic VC firms gain from partnerships with reputable foreign VC firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users are recognized as a vital source of innovation and entrepreneurship, transitioning from passive consumers to active creators. This shift has significantly impacted the entrepreneurial landscape, prompting multidisciplinary research. Using bibliometric and thematic coding, our study critically analyzes 179 articles published over a 25-year period. Our review presents a theoretical analysis and an integrative conceptual framework comprising eight inductively generated topics nested within three clusters, representing distinctive motivations, processes, and outcomes of user entrepreneurship. Our study also maps the theoretical foundations that have shaped the field, highlighting both dominant perspectives and opportunities for further theoretical development. By clarifying the distinctiveness of user entrepreneurship, our review advances theoretical understanding and provides a structured agenda for future knowledge accumulation.</content>

    <title>Political Foundations of Racial Violence in the Post-Reconstruction South</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Election results act as powerful signals, shaping social behavior in ways that can be dramatic and even violent. This paper shows how racial violence in the post-Reconstruction U.S. South was tied to the local performance of the anti-Black Democratic Party in presidential elections. Using a regression discontinuity design based on close presidential vote shares, we find that Southern counties where Democrats lost the popular vote between 1880 and 1900 were nearly twice as likely to experience Black lynchings in the following four years. Despite no corresponding changes in local officeholding, these defeats were salient among local elites. We show that Southern newspapers, closely aligned with the Democratic Party, amplified narratives of Black criminality in the aftermath of Democratic losses. Such accusations were, in turn, frequently invoked by lynch mobs. These findings point to the strategic use of racial violence by Democratic elites, foreshadowing the institutionalized vote suppression of Jim Crow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a two-tier supply chain in which multiple manufacturers sell their products through a single retailer, and consumer choices follow a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. Each manufacturer selects from its portfolio an assortment of products to sell, subject to a cardinality constraint on the size of the assortment.We consider both the case where manufacturers take wholesale prices as given and the case where they set their own wholesale prices. The retailer determines the retail prices of the products chosen.We develop efficient methods for computing profit-maximizing assortment and pricing strategies for manufacturers in a competitive environment. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms can reduce computational complexity by orders of magnitude in identifying pure strategy Nash equilibria, which we prove always exist. We also conduct a numerical case study to compare different wholesale pricing regimes, and find that the retailer may favor a cost-plus pricing with a uniform markup percentage, not because the rule induces assortment outcomes that maximize the total profit of the supply chain, but because it grants the retailer a larger share of that profit.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Algorithmic Targeting for Opaque Selling in Vertical Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by algorithmic targeting and data management, we explore a scenario where the seller holds an advantage over consumers regarding match-related information about products. The seller optimizes a product line consisting of two vertically differentiated products alongside an opaque product resulting from their mixture, strategically recommending these products to potential consumers. We model algorithmic targeting using an information design framework, and our investigation revolves around understanding how algorithmic targeting shapes consumer purchasing behaviors and influences market equilibrium. Furthermore, we explore the potential orchestration between algorithmic targeting and opaque selling, facilitated by product-line design. These two closely related instruments coincide in ex-ante manipulating information while differing in their targeting objects. Interestingly, only when the basic products exhibit intermediate differentiation does the seller use both instruments. This is because, when the disparity between the two primary products is extreme (either too large or too small), algorithmic targeting makes opaque selling ineffective at increasing profits. However, when these differences are moderate, the two strategies can complement each other. Opaque selling enhances profitability by introducing intermediate product variety, enabling more nuanced market segmentation, while algorithmic targeting is more flexible in promoting the willingness-to-pay of a wider range of consumers. Furthermore, when conducting welfare analysis, the adoption of algorithmic targeting is found sometimes to reduce consumer surplus but can enhance overall social welfare, highlighting the need for careful regulatory oversight in this domain.</content>

    <title>Unearthing Financial Statement Fraud: Insights from News Coverage Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a financial statement (FS) fraud detection framework, called PeerMeta, that makes improvements in all three components of the detection procedure: label measurement, feature set, and detection model. For the label measurement, prior studies mainly adopt FS fraud events that have already been disclosed and confirmed. We construct a new measure based on news coverage that can reflect unrevealed FS fraud behaviors as well. For the feature set, we innovatively add peer factors learned through the business description texts in financial reports. For the detection model, two meta-learning algorithms are applied to aggregate the 19 popular classifiers. The results indicate that the proposed method has amazingly high recall of real fraud cases announced by regulatory authorities, reaching a staggering value of 0.982. We document that all components in PeerMeta contribute to the improvements of FS fraud detection and also showcase the significant economic value of the detection framework and find that recall is more crucial for the economic value than precision.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71991470, 7199471, 72121002, 72310107002] and the National Key R&amp;D Program of China [Grant 2021YFC3340703].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03604 .</content>

    <title>Open at the Core: Moving from Proprietary Technology to Building a Product on Open Source Software</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly moving away from proprietary technology to building commercial products on top of open source software. However, it is unclear how such commercialization of open source affects contributions from the community, as well as product quality and firm performance. Web browser technology provides a unique setting to study such questions. The largest open source project is Chromium, led by Google, which serves as the core of various web browsers. Unexpectedly, Microsoft announced a drastic change in strategy in 2018 and adopted Chromium in a complete redesign of the web browser Edge. Unique data lets us compare Chromium to other open source technologies, and Chromium-based web browsers to other web browsers. We find that overall development activity increases after Microsoft adopts Chromium, predominantly because Microsoft starts to contribute to the project. We also see a modest increase in contributions from external developers. We further document an increase in scrutiny, evident from an increase in the number of individuals performing code reviews and a surge in security vulnerability reporting. We also find positive effects for Microsoft. Edge makes a giant leap in functionality, moving it on par with the market leader Chrome. With the adoption of Chromium, Microsoft fixes more bugs, accelerates release cycles, and increases the market share of Edge at the expense of other less popular Chromium browsers. We discuss a number of general implications for managers and policy.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Customization and the Customer Journey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently offer customers the opportunity to customize in addition to buying ready-made products. Although prior research shows that customization can increase product evaluations, purchase intent, and willingness to pay, customers often do not opt into customization. Using a multi-method approach, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that the Customization Journey is dynamic rather than static: an initial customization experience has a lasting impact on the customer journey. Nine years of transaction data from a retailer shows that customers who customize at least one product are more likely to customize again with the retailer; they also spend more, visit more often, and buy more items. Next, we conduct a series of longitudinal experimental studies. By randomly assigning some participants to customize and others to choose among a matched set of products, we disentangle the effects of the customer’s inherent preference for customizing from their experience with customization. We find that an initial experience with customization significantly increases the subsequent likelihood of customization, leading to more favorable outcomes for both the customer and the retailer. Our findings suggest that customizers need not be “born”—they can be “created” via interventions designed to increase experience with customization, shaping the trajectories of customer journeys.</content>

    <title>Star Advantage: Employee Value Creation and Capture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into knowledge work is fundamentally reshaping employee performance and value creation in ways that challenge conventional wisdom. Rather than performance disparities being reduced through AI adoption, we argue that they may increase as star employees leverage superior domain expertise and strategic AI deployment to widen performance gaps—a phenomenon we term the “AI‐specific Matthew Effect.” These performance transformations coincide with dramatic shifts in value appropriation dynamics: Personal AI tools will enhance employee bargaining power by enabling portable, high‐value outputs independent of organizational resources, whereas enterprise AI systems serve as novel isolating mechanisms that strengthen firm value capture. These developments necessitate a theoretical reconceptualization of strategic human capital frameworks. Accordingly, we introduce the AI‐specific Matthew Effect to explain how AI may intensify performance stratification, modeling how AI reconfigures value creation and capture between employees and firms, and extending foundational human capital theories to account for human–AI complementarity. Our integrative theoretical framework offers critical guidance for navigating this transformation, helping organizations balance productivity gains with workforce equity in an uncertain era of interdependent human and artificial intelligence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thriving at work is a psychological state defined by dual experiences of vitality and learning. Existing research suggests that HRM practices can play a pivotal role in fostering employee thriving. In this perspective paper, we review the current literature on the relationship between HRM practices and employee thriving through five broad conceptual frameworks: (1) high‐performance HRM systems, (2) development‐oriented HRM, (3) purposeful and responsible HRM, (4) relational and inclusive HRM, and (5) multilevel contextual HRM. Beyond this review, we propose four key avenues for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of how HRM practices contribute to employee thriving. These research directions seek to explore the underlying mechanisms, contexts, and conditions that influence the effectiveness of HRM practices in promoting thriving, with a particular focus on sustaining employee thriving over time. Through these insights, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how HRM can be strategically designed and implemented to support sustainable and regenerative thriving in dynamic work environments.</content>

    <title>The extent and drivers of internal agglomeration of U.S. multi‐unit firms</title>
    <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the extent and determinants of internal agglomeration—the spatial clustering of establishments within firms. It introduces a novel methodology that benchmarks a firm's spatial footprint against that of comparable stand‐alone firms, yielding a firm‐level measure of internal agglomeration. Applied across sectors of the U.S. economy, the approach reveals that internal agglomeration is widespread but varies by industry and firm characteristics. It is more prevalent in service, non‐tradable, and labor‐intensive industries, and is especially pronounced among diversified firms. Among potential drivers, labor similarity consistently predicts intra‐firm colocation, while input–output and knowledge linkages are less influential. These findings bring a spatial lens to corporate strategy, showing that when key resources—particularly labor—face geographic frictions, colocating related activities enhances opportunities for sharing and redeployment.Managerial SummaryMany firms are known to colocate or cluster with other firms in related industries to reap the benefits of sharing specialized inputs, labor, and knowledge. We study whether multi‐unit firms can generate similar benefits by colocating their establishments. We examine the geographic distribution of establishments of multi‐unit firms using comprehensive data on the U.S. economy. We find that over half of all firms colocate their establishments significantly more than would be expected if these belonged to independent firms. Firms are especially likely to colocate establishments with similar labor requirements, which suggests a deliberate strategy to leverage internal labor synergies. Our findings suggest that managers should consider the potential benefits of internal resource sharing when selecting locations, particularly to capitalize on synergies from resources that are less geographically mobile.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do banks fail? We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1863 through 2024 to study the history of failing banks in the United States. Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. These commonalities imply that bank failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Failures with runs were common before deposit insurance, but these failures are strongly related to weak fundamentals, casting doubt on the importance of non-fundamental runs. Furthermore, low recovery rates on failed banks’ assets suggest that most failed banks subject to runs were fundamentally insolvent, barring large value destruction of receiverships. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the primary cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals.</content>

    <title>How Does Prepopulating Search Bars with Keywords Affect Online Consumer Behavior? A Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Search aid technologies, especially prepopulated search bars, are increasingly being adopted by major players in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of prepopulating search bars with keywords on online consumer journey. In this study, I design and run a randomized field experiment on a large e-commerce platform involving 72,587 consumers who were randomly exposed to three types of keywords prefilled in the search bar. Individual consumer–level analyses reveal that prepopulating trending category keywords encourages users to discover and buy items from the suggested category without reducing queries using self-entered keywords, ultimately leading to a 10.4% (8.8%) increase in purchase incidence (spending) compared with the counterfactual outcomes when the search bar is empty. Prepopulating personalized keywords brings about more focused product searching within the category recently browsed by users, resulting in a 21% (17%) increase in purchase incidence (spending), although this is offset by the negative effect of a reduction in queries using self-entered keywords. Exposure to niche category keywords is found to have little impact. This study also finds that a prepopulated search bar does not cannibalize the other navigation tool, making it a beneficial addition to the focal e-commerce platform’s business outcomes. These findings, contributing to the literature on consumer search and product recommendation strategies for digital platforms, carry timely implications for e-commerce managers.History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0793 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the dynamic landscape of the digital economy, social trading platforms are experiencing rapid growth. Our study delves into the impact of changes in social audience size—measured by the number of followers—on traders’ performance and behaviors. Utilizing data from a company-led randomized field experiment conducted on a prominent cryptocurrency social trading platform, we unearth intriguing findings. Traders garnering increased social audience size exhibit tendencies to trade more frequently, utilize higher leverage, and, surprisingly, attain poorer performance. Notably, these adverse effects intensify among traders who previously excelled, suggesting a link to overconfidence. Interestingly, our research uncovers a reference point effect associated with social audience size. Removing accumulated social audience size does not alleviate the negative consequences, instead, they persist. Additionally, we observe an extra adverse effect when traders experience a reduction in the digit magnitude of follower counts, supporting our hypothesis about social audience size serving as a reference point. Our study carries significant implications for the design of social trading platforms. It serves as a crucial reminder for both traders and platform managers to carefully navigate the interplay between social audience size dynamics and trading decisions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact of personalized pricing through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights within college athletics on the recruitment of high school football players by college programs. We focus on whether the new policy disrupts competitive balance by increasing the concentration of talent among top-ranked institutions. Using a data set that encompasses pre- and post-NIL recruitment patterns to examine the distribution of 3, 4, and 5* recruits at college football programs, we find a notable increase in the dispersion of talent. Contrary to the hypothesis that NIL would lead to a “rich get richer” dynamic, we observe a tendency for lower-ranked football programs to attract higher-quality recruits post-NIL, especially among 5- and lower ranked 4* athletes. Furthermore, we show that post-NIL 3* recruits are sacrificing schooling for NIL money and are attending colleges that are less selective and have lower SAT class averages and whose graduates earn a lower midcareer income. We also do not find evidence that schools that spend more money on football are attracting better talent post-NIL. Competitiveness improves post-NIL as sportsbooks set smaller point differentials even after controlling for talent, performance, and the transfer portal. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive examination of NIL’s short-term effects on competitive balance and sets the stage for ongoing research into the long-term consequences of this landmark policy change.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06423 .</content>

    <title>Product Ratings and Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we investigate how information about production externalities, such as ecolabels, can be presented to create market pressure on firms to reduce these externalities. Specifically, we explore whether integrating information on externalities with consumer product ratings into a single combined rating can generate pressure to reduce externalities from all consumers, not just environmentally conscious ones. Theoretically, we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium where producers invest in both high product quality and low production externalities. We show that under separate ratings, this equilibrium depends on a high proportion of “green” consumers, whereas a combined rating achieves similar results without such a requirement. More broadly, our model suggests that bundling ratings can compel producers to address niche concerns more effectively. We experimentally validate this prediction across two studies, confirming that bundling ratings significantly increases producer investment in additional attributes, such as reducing externalities, while maintaining the rating system’s ability to incentivize high product quality.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was financed by BI Norwegian Business School and the University of Bergen.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04684 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding cultural differences in risk perception is critical in an increasingly uncertain world. Here we examine the relationship between the individualism-collectivism continuum and risk perception around the world using a data set from the Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll. The data set contains rich information of a representative sample of 150,000 participants from 142 countries, and investigates risk perception in terms of perceived likelihood and personal experiences for a range of risks in daily life. We observe that participants from countries with a more individualistic culture perceive lower risk after controlling their personal experiences. We observe similar but weaker patterns when we adopt an epidemiological approach to investigate the individualistic cultural influence of first- and second-generation immigrants and use historical kinship tightness to proxy for individualism. Our study sheds light on the importance of culture in shaping risk perception and contributes to understanding global differences in behavioral traits.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was supported by the Social Science Research Council (Singapore) [Grant MOE2022-SSRTG-029].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01612 .</content>

    <title>How Search Engine Impacts Market Structure: Empirical Evidence from a Multivendor Darknet Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the public’s familiarity with search engines, little existing research empirically investigates the impact of such a search-cost-reduction tool on online market structure. Knowledge scarcity of this question can mainly be attributed to the challenge of accessing detailed data from a cross-website search engine. Using data from the online illegal transaction platform, the Darknet markets, we manage to empirically evaluate the influence of a cross-website search engine (i.e., GRAMS) on the market structure at the vendor and product category levels. The results show that, although the search engine’s entry enhances the overall market performance, the benefit is more significant among leading vendors and popular products, contributing to a more concentrated market. Additional analyses provide empirical evidence that the trustworthiness and the scale-up ability of leading vendors can be the underlying mechanisms for the increased market concentration after the introduction of search engines into Darknet markets. Our study not only contributes to the literature on the dynamics of sales distribution in a multiple-vendor e-commerce market but also provides insights into understanding the operating dynamics of the Darknet markets, which can be helpful for law enforcement policymaking.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates sample selection bias in early-stage investment. We use comprehensive administrative data on the universe of new firm starts in Norway, allowing us to compare venture-backed firms with ex ante similar firms that do not receive venture funding. The valuation premium for venture backing is sizeable at firm birth and doubles over the first 5 years, implying a substantial upward bias in venture capital (VC) returns relative to comparable firms. In contrast, the premium for firms receiving multiple rounds of outside equity emerges only after the first year and remains significantly smaller than the VC premium throughout the firm life cycle.</content>

    <title>Digital Development: Reimagining Research Beyond ICT4D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions: digital in development (institutional use), digital for development (conscious design for outcomes), and development in a digital world (digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development.</content>

    <title>Right on cue? Category‐switching in online marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and why do producers change the categorization of their offerings? Prior categorization research assumes that producers engage in ongoing efforts to proactively optimize their categorical positioning, but this assumption may not hold for many producers due to their limited attentional capacity. Our theoretical account instead highlights the role of expectation violation cues—salient pieces of information indicating a violation of audience expectations—as triggers that can lead producers to revise their category choice. Our longitudinal study of 84,667 Airbnb hosts' categorization choices finds that negative customer reviews—an important form of expectation violation cue—significantly increase the likelihood of category‐switching, particularly in categories with heterogeneous expectations. Our study suggests that many producers might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.Managerial SummaryHow businesses categorize their products and services influences their commercial success; yet, there exists very limited understanding of when, why, and how businesses revise their category choices. Our study, which tracked the category choices of over 80,000 Airbnb hosts over time, reveals that Airbnb hosts most commonly switch categories after receiving negative customer reviews, particularly when a review indicates that the accommodation did not meet customer expectations and if the previously chosen category lacks a clearly defined set of expected features. When switching categories, hosts tend to choose categories that are relatively similar to their prior choices and that seem to accommodate a wide variety of offerings. These patterns suggest that many businesses might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.</content>

    <title>Competing through category interaction codes: An inhabited view of category strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces category interaction codes—knowledge regarding the expected interactions around entities in a given category—as a critical dimension of category strategy. Through historical analysis of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we demonstrate how these codes shape strategic categorization and competitive dynamics. We show that firms can exploit ambiguous interaction codes to access advantageous decision makers and organizational routines, circumventing entrenched competitors. Further, firms can institutionalize preferred interaction codes through product design, reshaping category prototypes and market dynamics. However, overcommitment to specific interaction codes creates competitive vulnerabilities when market conditions shift. By developing an “inhabited” view of categories that emphasizes socially embedded practices, this study reveals how market categories are enacted through interactions and offers new insights into category‐based competition.Managerial SummaryThis study introducescategory interaction codes—expectations about where, when, how and by whom products are evaluated, used, and purchased within a market. Using the case of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we show that companies can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging and reconfiguringcategory interaction codes. For example, Wang Laboratories sidestepped direct competition with IBM by categorizing its products for engineers and department managers rather than MIS executives, and outperformed IBM in word processing by innovating how actors interact with the new category. For managers, the key insight is that success depends not only on product features but also on how your product fits into the daily decisions, roles, and behaviors that define a category.</content>

    <title>The role of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; integrity in M&amp;amp;A decision‐making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the influence of CEO characteristics on M&amp;A decisions has long spurred researchers’ interest, little attention has been devoted to the ramifications of CEO integrity—the adherence to generally accepted norms and standards. We investigate how CEO integrity influences different stages of the M&amp;A decision process. Specifically, we argue that while CEO integrity reduces self‐serving behavior, it may also become a golden cage that constrains CEOs’ latitude of action. Accordingly, we find that CEO integrity decreases the probability of Type I errors (errors of commission) but increases the probability of Type II errors (errors of omission) in M&amp;A decision‐making. We contribute to theory development by putting forward CEO integrity as an important personality construct for upper echelons research to build on and extend further.Managerial SummaryThis paper examines how CEO integrity influences M&amp;A decision‐making, providing key insights for corporate strategy. Analyzing data from S&amp;P 1500 firms (2006‐2021), we find that CEOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in frequent or large‐scale M&amp;As, particularly avoiding cross‐border deals due to higher uncertainty and potential risks. High‐integrity CEOs also tend to pay lower acquisition premiums and take longer to complete deals, reflecting a cautious and thorough approach. While CEO integrity helps protect firms from costly mistakes it may also lead to missed growth opportunities, indicating a trade‐off between stakeholder considerations and strategic risk‐taking. Boards may need to tailor governance frameworks to optimize the balance between the benefits and constraints of CEO integrity.</content>

    <title>Human–Algorithmic Bias: Source, Evolution, and Impact</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior work on human-algorithmic bias has seen difficulty in empirically identifying the underlying mechanisms of bias because in a typical “one-time” decision-making scenario, different mechanisms generate the same patterns of observable decisions. In this study, leveraging a unique repeat decision-making setting in a high-stakes microlending context, we aim to uncover the underlying source, evolution dynamics, and associated impacts of bias. We first develop a structural econometric model of the decision dynamics to understand the source and evolution of bias in human evaluators in microloan granting. We find that both preference-based and belief-based biases exist in human decisions and are in favor of female applicants. Our counterfactual simulations show that the elimination of either of the two biases improves the fairness in financial resource allocation as well as the platform profits. The profit improvement mainly stems from the increased approval probability for male borrowers, especially those who would eventually pay back loans. Furthermore, to examine how human biases evolve when being inherited by machine learning (ML) algorithms, we train state-of-the-art ML algorithms for default risk prediction on both real-world data sets with human biases encoded within and counterfactual data sets with human biases partially or fully removed. We find that even fairness-unaware ML algorithms can reduce bias in human decisions. Interestingly, although removing both types of human bias from the training data can further improve ML fairness, the fairness-enhancing effects vary significantly between new and repeat applicants. Based on our findings, we discuss how to reduce decision bias most effectively in a human-ML pipeline.This paper has been accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that stock lenders are informed about market conditions and pursue revenue maximization by setting premiums or offering discounts on stock loan fees. Using a model of supply and demand in the equity lending market, we illustrate the effect of stock borrowers’ private information on the elasticity of shorting demand. Strategic lenders respond to demand elasticity and increase their revenues through premiums or discounts on lending fees. Empirically, decomposing stock loan fees into intrinsic fee and premium or discount, we confirm lenders’ strategic behavior, showing that premiums and discounts among difficult-to-borrow stocks lead to increased lending revenues. This strategic lending behavior has new implications about informed shorting, short interest, and transaction costs in the equity lending market.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03270 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mutual funds known as closet indexers are marketed as active but actually operate as low-activity funds. Investors end up paying for full service but receiving only a part of it. Supervisory authorities around the world are considering ways to regulate these funds. In this context, we examine the impact of regulatory interventions by Scandinavian regulators. We compare the scrutinized Scandinavian funds with similar unaffected European funds. The findings suggest that the regulated Scandinavian funds preferred increased activity over fee reduction. Consequently, fund managers adopted more active management strategies, resulting in a significant 2% decrease in annual alpha. Therefore, the regulatory interventions resulted in unfavorable outcomes for investors.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This research was supported by funding from the Varekrigsfond for forsikringsaktiviteter at NHH.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03124 .</content>

    <title>Inheriting Versus Developing Data Analytic Tests and Auditors’ Professional Skepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the use of audit data analytic tests (ADA) becomes increasingly established in practice, auditors will often confront situations in which they inherit ADA developed by others, as opposed to developing the ADA themselves. Despite the potential benefits of ADA, inheriting ADA could decrease auditors’ skeptical actions by diminishing their psychological ownership of the ADA. In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA. Evidence from mediation analyses suggests that these effects are driven by decreased psychological ownership when auditors inherit the ADA.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the usefulness of machine learning approaches for measuring vocal tone in corporate disclosures. We document a substantial mismatch between the widely adopted actor‐based training data underlying these approaches and speech in corporate disclosures. We find that existing models achieve near‐perfect vocal tone classification within their training domain. However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance. Our findings emphasize the importance of a domain‐specific approach to voice analysis in accounting and finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous Entrepreneurship has been conceptualized as arising from and reflecting cultural characteristics common to Indigenous people internationally, yet this approach increasingly fails to capture its diversity. Drawing on a database of 19,530 Indigenous enterprises in Australia, we show that criterial approaches to defining Indigenous Entrepreneurship based on preconceived ideas about Indigenous ways of doing business do not adequately characterize Indigenous entrepreneurial activity. We propose an approach that analyses Indigenous entrepreneurialism as a strategic response to the challenges and opportunities encountered by Indigenous entrepreneurs, shifting the focus of study fromexpressions of indigeneity in entrepreneurship, toentrepreneurial responses to Indigenous contexts.</content>
