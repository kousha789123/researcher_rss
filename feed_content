    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the performance of advisors’ recommendations influence investors’ propensity to seek advice again? I investigate a sample of calls between 10,063 German brokerage clients and financial advisors from 2005–2015. If advisors’ recommendations in the initial meeting led to positive (vs. negative) performance, investors are 2.1 times more likely to arrange a second meeting. This effect is driven by the performance of the recommendations the investor decided to follow. Investors with positive performance follow recommendations to a greater degree. The findings show that experiences matter in the advisory context and shape the demand for advice. (JEL D14; G11; G40; G51)</content>

    <title>Traditional Institutions in Modern Times: Dowries as Pensions When Sons Migrate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses newly-collected data on the allocation of dowry to examine its role in resolving intergenerational frictions around migration in India. Migration disrupts traditional elderly support structures, in which sons live near their parents and care for them in old age. We develop a model in which dowry can promote migration by allowing sons to make upfront transfers to their parents and ease constraints on income sharing. To test this hypothesis, we collect two new datasets that measure the distribution of dowry between family members. We document for the first time that net transfers of dowry to a man’s parents are common but far from universal. Consistent with using dowry for income sharing, such transfers occur more often when sons migrate, especially when they work in higher-earning occupations. In nationally representative data, migration rates are higher in areas with stronger historical dowry traditions. Finally, exploiting a large-scale highway construction program, we show that men from areas with stronger historical dowry traditions migrate more when migration costs fall. Our findings provide some clues as to why dowry persists despite its well-documented adverse consequences.</content>

    <title>Aggregation and the Estimation of Quality Change: Application to U.S. Import Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the contribution of changes in quality, price, and variety entry/exit to the aggregate price index for smooth, invertible demand systems, generalizing the standard results derived in the CES case. The results require the knowledge of heterogeneous cross-product elasticities of substitution. To apply them in practice, we also show how to identify rich demand systems using data only on prices and market shares, without the need for external cost-shock instruments or strong assumptions on the covariance between supply and demand shocks. Using this approach, we compute the U.S. import price index based on the Kimball demand system. We find that quality change on average lowered the inflation in import prices by around 0.007 log points annually (1989–2016). To further validate our approach, we show that it estimates price elasticities and quality changes similar to those found by the standard mixed logit (BLP) demand in data on the U.S. auto market.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Strategic Consumers and Direct Channel on Supply Chain Contracting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impacts of strategic consumers and direct channel on the manufacturer’s choice between static and dynamic contracts. We consider two scenarios: One in which the manufacturer sells through a single retailer, and the other in which it sells through two different retailers sequentially. In each scenario, the retailer(s) sets the retail prices, which the manufacturer’s direct channel matches, while consumers may time their purchases. We derive the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We find that in the first scenario, the static wholesale contract is preferred if the market share of the direct channel is large, as it alleviates strategic consumer waiting. This is most effective when consumers are moderately strategic. In the second scenario, intertemporal competition arises between the two retailers, which may not only reduce supply chain friction but also counteract strategic waiting. As a result, the equilibrium changes structurally. The dynamic wholesale contract is preferred when consumers are not very strategic, and the direct channel no longer plays a significant role. Several extensions of our main setting are explored. Our findings provide practical insights into how an upstream firm can effectively manage its retail channel in the presence of a direct channel and strategic consumers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Influence of Power on Trust in Buyer−Supplier Relationships: An Actor−Partner Interdependence Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trust is among the most critical factors in buyer−supplier relationships. In an effort to understand the origins of trust, power has become the focus of a burgeoning body of literature. However, research on the association between power and trust has been plagued by inconsistencies in terms of whose power and trust are being examined, which has led to confusion and hindered cumulative progress. We address this issue by disentangling the effect of the focal organization (actor effect) from the effect specific to its partner (partner effect) and accounting for both simultaneously. We further theorize and show that the partner’s level of self-promotion communication about his or her own achievements and credentials moderates both actor and partner effects, thus adding knowledge about a contingency that accounts for a considerable degree of variation in the linkage between power and trust. Using multi-informant, dyadic survey data paired with archival information scraped from firms’ webpages, we find that (i) actors low (vs. high) in power tend to place more trust (ii) while simultaneously eliciting higher levels of trust from their partners; however, (iii) these effects differ markedly depending on the partner’s level of self-promotion communication. Our study offers a novel, integrative perspective on power and trust, and we elaborate on its important implications for understanding buyer−supplier relationships.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Growth of a Two-Sided Platform with Heterogeneous Agents</title>
    <updated>2025-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the dynamics of a two-sided platform, where the agent population on both sides experiences growth over time with heterogeneous growth rates. The compatibility between buyers and sellers is captured by a bipartite network. The platform sets commissions to optimize its total profit overTperiods, considering the trade-off between short-term profit and growth as well as the spatial imbalances in supply and demand. We design an asymptotically optimal policy with the profit loss upper-bounded by a constant independent ofT, in contrast with a myopic policy shown to be arbitrarily bad. To derive the policy, we first develop a benchmark problem that captures the platform’s optimal steady state. We then identify the agent types with the lowest relative population ratio compared to the benchmark in each period, and adjust the service level of these types to be higher than or equal to their service level in the benchmark problem. A higher service level accelerates growth but requires substantial subsidies during the growth phase. Additionally, we provide the conditions under which the subsidy is necessary. We further examine the impact of the growth potential and the compatibility network structure on the platform’s optimal profit, the agents’ payment/income, and the optimal commissions at the optimal steady state. To achieve that, we introduce innovative metrics to quantify the long-run growth potential of each agent type. Using these metrics, we show that a “balanced” compatibility network, where the relative long-run growth potential between sellers and buyers for all submarkets is the same as that for the entire market, allows the platform to achieve maximum profitability. Our study provides insight into how the growth potential and compatibility network structure jointly influence the commission policy in the growth process and the optimal steady state.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: DICE: Advancing Social Media Research through Digital In-Context Experiments</title>
    <updated>2025-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article introduces Digital In-Context Experiments (DICE), an experimental paradigm that enables researchers to study entire social media feeds while tracking users’ granular behavioral data at the post level. Current research paradigms (vignette-based experiments, online platform studies, and observational studies) predominantly focus on isolated social media posts without examining how users consume content within the broader context of a feed. This isolation overlooks the competing attention between content (e.g., sponsored posts or ads) within a feed and contextual spillovers that occur when users scroll through continuous streams of content. DICE complements existing paradigms by presenting posts withinscrollable feeds, more closely resembling how users experience content on social media. This allows researchers to systematically manipulate entire feed compositions while unobtrusively tracking participants’ scrolling behavior. To demonstrate the potential of DICE, the article presents two illustrative case studies that examine contextual spillovers and predict ad recall in environments where content competes for attention. The authors conclude with directions for future research and managerial perspectives derived from expert interviews with marketing professionals. An accompanying open-source app, available athttps://dice-app.org, enables researchers to conveniently integrate the experimental paradigm into their preferred workflow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Article Title: “The ITEM Ontology: A Tool to Elucidate the Anatomy of Psychometric Indicators”Authors:Kai R. Larsen, University of Colorado BoulderRoland M. Mueller, Berlin School of Economics and LawDario Bonaretti, NEOMA Business SchoolDiana Fischer-Preßler, University of Applied Sciences FrankfurtJames (Jim) Burleson, California Polytechnic State UniversityNimisha Singh, Bennett University, IndiaJeffrey Parsons, Memorial University of NewfoundlandJean-Charles Pillet, Toulouse Business SchoolLan Sang, University of Colorado BoulderZhu (Drew) Zhang, University of Rhode IslandProblem definition:For decades, scientists have treated the survey item as the atomic unit of psychological measurement, an indivisible entity to be validated primarily through statistics. But what if we have been looking at the wrong level of analysis? Despite sophisticated modeling techniques, even well-validated instruments often contain items that are vague, double-barreled, or semantically misaligned with their intended constructs. These flaws remain undetected because current methods ignore the semantic anatomy of items. There is no shared language for decomposing indicators into the elements that carry meaning.Relevance:We show that psychometric measurement cannot be understood at the item or construct level and, for the first time, demonstrate that problems such as double-barreled items, restriction of range, and double negation can now be operationally defined and automatically detected. We argue that without tools like the ITEM Ontology, psychological measurement will never be precise enough to match the precision required for tasks such as medication optimization, leadership evaluation, technology impact assessment, and political polling.Theoretical foundations: This paper advances a new theory of survey indicator design by proposing that indicators can—and should—be deconstructed into meaningful components such as objects, actions, attributes, qualifiers, and response formats. This component-level analysis reveals structural and semantic flaws that traditional psychometric techniques often miss. Although grounded in linguistic and cognitive theory, our framework also draws on principles from established ontologies, particularly DOLCE, to ensure conceptual rigor and consistency. By making the internal anatomy of indicators explicit, the approach offers a foundational shift in how we understand, evaluate, and improve survey-based measurement.Methodology: We used design science methodologies to develop, refine, and test the ontology.Results: In addition to the ITEM ontology, we also provide a website ( http://www.itemontology.org/ ) that enables researchers to code indicators within the ontology, along with the ITEMIZER tool, which highlights potential wording issues and construct validity concerns associated with coded indicators.Contributions: This paper enables researchers and survey writers to understand the underlying components and their relationships within and across survey indicators. With the ITEM ontology, not only can we enhance the quality of future surveys, but we also provide a language to discuss how indicators are written and how they can be improved. We demonstrate the value of the ITEM Ontology by presenting two use cases for evaluating item quality and validating content.Keywords: ontology, psychometrics, indicator evaluation, validity, scale developmentProblem definition: What is your research problem/question in simple terms?Relevance: Why is this problem relevant for research and/or practice?Theoretical foundations: What theory (theories) underlie this work (if applicable)?Methodology: What is the research approach used (if applicable)?

    <title>When AI Becomes an Agent of the Firm: Examining the Evolution of AI in Organizations Through an Agency Theory Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our work begins with the premise that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into firm decision making parallels the emergence of the professional manager, which prompted the birth of agency theory. We examine the evolution of AI through an agency theory lens, considering how the nature of firm control and decision rights change as AI evolves. While AI will initially mimic human routines, we theorize a point at which the AI system will achieve a level of autonomy and self‐determination to be considered an agent of the firm. How, then, can we align an agent with the fate of the firm, when that agent is no longer a human? To address this, we integrate agency theory with a model of AI evolution, demonstrating that conflict between an AI agent and the firm will require a reconsideration of agency mechanisms if agent‐principal alignment is to be achieved. We theorize specific forms of monitoring and incentive alignment that serve to align an AI agent with the firm's interests, thus extending agency mechanisms in the context of AI. Our theoretical exercise offers important implications for scholarship at the intersection of AI and organizational theory, as well as considerations for practice and policy.</content>

    <title>The &lt;scp&gt;ABCs&lt;/scp&gt; of Quiet Quitting: A Bifurcated Framework of Its Passive and Deliberate Types</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our multi‐study, mixed‐methods research introduces a novel framework of quiet quitting and distinguishes it from related constructs in the human resources and organizational behavior literature. Studies 1 and 2 employ topic modeling of social and news media data and qualitative content analysis of in‐depth interviews with self‐identified quiet quitters, respectively, to examine how social media users, journalists, and quiet quitters define quiet quitting and describe its antecedents and consequences. Drawing on Kahn's framework of disengagement, we develop a bifurcated framework of quiet quitting comprising passive and deliberate types, each with distinct affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions. Study 3 uses a quasi‐Q‐sort methodology to compare passive and deliberate quiet quitting with existing human resources and organizational behavior constructs and reveals that quiet quitting is a novel concept, with its passive and deliberate types being distinct from nomologically related constructs. Our bifurcated framework makes valuable theoretical contributions and offers nuanced practical implications for organizations, establishing a solid foundation for future research to treat quiet quitting as a discrete phenomenon, moving the conversation beyond debating its academic relevance.</content>

    <title>Employee Age and the Work–Family Interface: A Meta‐Analysis and Framework Integrating Life Span and Life Course Perspectives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on the relationship between age and the work–family interface (WFI) is critical to effective human resource management. Yet, findings remain inconsistent and lack theoretical integration. We conducted a meta‐analysis (k= 256,n= 186,109) integrating lifespan and life course perspectives to develop a model of the relationship between age and the WFI. Drawing on socio‐emotional selectivity theory (SEST), a prevalent lifespan approach, results reveal a significant linear relationship between age and the WFI, with variation contingent on the construct and directionality. Age was negatively associated with work‐to‐family conflict, family‐to‐work conflict, and family‐to‐work enrichment, and positively associated with work‐to‐family enrichment and work–family balance. We integrated a life course view to examine how personal (gender, race, age cohort), situational (job, marital status), and contextual (national, global) factors moderate these relationships. Declines in work‐to‐family conflict with age occurred for men but not women, suggesting a widening gender gap for older compared to younger workers. The negative association between age and work‐to‐family conflict was stronger than for family‐to‐work conflict among older adults (over age 50 cohort) and professionals. Younger adult workers under 30 reported significant work‐to‐family conflict. The relationship between age and the WFI was significantly moderated by national (U.S., Non‐U.S.) and global (Global North, Global South) contexts, with the strength of age‐related patterns in work–family conflict varying by gender and job status. Our results highlight that future HRM studies and organizational practice should focus on advancing age‐inclusive policies to better address the increasingly varied age and work–family relationships across many employee subgroups.</content>

    <title>When Managers Stay, Workers Are Safer: Rethinking the Value of Firm-Specific Human Capital</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A commonly held assumption is that firm-specific human capital benefits firms while constraining employees, particularly by reducing their external mobility. While this tension holds in many contexts, it overlooks the possibility that firm-specific human capital developed by one group of employees—managers—can generate positive externalities for others. Using a novel empirical setting and a 16-year panel of 19,044 establishments with 107,309 establishment-year observations, we find that an increase in managers’ firm-specific human capital is associated with improvements in workplace safety. These effects are especially pronounced in organizations with weak safety orientations and with higher proportions of lower-skill employees, who are typically more vulnerable to safety risks. Our findings reveal a previously underexplored channel through which firm-specific human capital creates value: by enabling managers to protect other employees. This challenges the prevailing view that firm-specific human capital primarily serves firm interests and highlights a broader set of beneficiaries—offering a new perspective on the role of managers’ firm-specific human capital in shaping organizational outcomes.</content>

    <title>Is Everyone Having a Good Time? The Effects of Complex Organizational Rituals on Employee Engagement and Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The organizational rituals literature has primarily focused on simple rituals and their positive effects on participants. While generative, this focus has obscured the intricacy and potential downsides of complex rituals, such as workplace celebrations and team-building retreats. In our research, we leverage Interaction Rituals Theory (IRT) to broaden the theoretical foundation of the study of organizational rituals by examining the range of experiences that employees have within complex organizational rituals. First, we inductively identify the positive and negative experiences within complex organizational rituals and create scales to measure them. Next, drawing further from IRT, we develop a model explaining how these experiences affect employee engagement and identify the subsequent work behaviors most likely to be affected by ritual-induced changes in engagement (helping, loyal boosterism, and job search behavior). In two field studies in the United States and Germany, we test this model, first in a single complex organizational ritual (i.e., company holiday party) and then across a broader set of common complex organizational rituals. Across both studies, we find that employees’ positive experiences during an organizational ritual enhance engagement and predict subsequent work behavior, while their effects can be significantly diminished by negative ritual experiences, challenging the assumption that rituals are uniformly beneficial. By providing evidence for a more balanced perspective on the impact of organizational rituals, our work provides a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the true nature of organizational rituals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A crisis is a juncture that demands decision and action. We live in times of wicked crises, that is, crises that are non-linearly interlinked; transgress organizational, institutional, and cultural boundaries; and can be addressed only collectively. Our chances to rise to wicked crises depend on our capacity to decide and to act in concert, which is power, according to political philosopher Hannah Arendt. In this essay, in honor ofAdministrative Science Quarterly’s 70th volume, I highlight different features of wicked crises and discuss two interrelated forces that weaken and undermine such power: first, organizational fragmentation, which results in governance complexity and fault lines, and second, societal fragmentation, which manifests in growing distrust in core cultural institutions, polarization, the loss of a shared lifeworld, and the rise of authoritarianism. I conclude with a call to action for our discipline.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs who face recurring crises must repeatedly navigate lengthy recovery processes. In this article, we go beyond immediate responses and individual-level outcomes to focus on the evolution of entrepreneurial perseverance as entrepreneurs engage with broader recovery efforts post-crisis. We examined the experiences of 33 entrepreneurs during and following the Calbuco Volcano eruptions in Chile from 2015 to 2019. We discovered three social cues that reinforce entrepreneurial perseverance over extended periods of time: descriptive (the sharing of recovery memories), injunctive (the socialization of recovery work ethic), and symbolic (the celebration of recovery legacies). Findings show how socially reinforced entrepreneurial perseverance becomes intertwined with broader recovery efforts creating a sustained collective response to crisis, which we theorize asrelational entrepreneurial perseverancein extreme contexts. This changes our understanding of long-term entrepreneurial perseverance. Perseverance resides not simply in the individual entrepreneur but in social reinforcement, social support, and the capacity for connection, that is, the connection between individual actions, group principles, and community celebration. These create entrepreneurial recovery legacies that act as memory assets to be used when the next crisis hits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some firms pursue open design activities, that is, they freely share innovation-related knowledge with the outside world instead of keeping it secret or protected via patents. Through a series of lab and field studies, this research examines consumer beliefs and reactions to firms’ open design activities and documents a positiveopen design effect: presenting a product as open design (vs. not) increases its attractiveness to consumers. This effect emerges because consumers view firms that freely share innovation-related knowledge as providing benefits to society. Consistent with this societal benefits account, the effect is found to be stronger when (1) moral (vs. selfish) firm motives are made salient and (2) many (vs. few) other firms have already utilized the shared knowledge. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the effect is anchored in the notion that open design activities involve outflows of firm-internal (vs. inflows of firm-external) knowledge. By showing that consumers judge the way firms undertake innovation as more (vs. less) beneficial for society, this research extends the literatures on open design, open innovation, corporate social responsibility, and marketplace morality.</content>

    <title>From Diminishment to Development: A Sensemaking Model of How Life Experiences Foster Humility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is not uncommon for people to recount humbling experiences that have transformed how they see themselves and approach their work. Although the benefits of humbling experiences are widely assumed, we have an incomplete understanding of what these experiences entail and how they may help forge humility. Existing research consists largely of idiosyncratic lists of events that might be humbling without deeper inquiry into what makes these experiences unique or how they are integrated into one’s identity. Our theorizing combines insights from the sensemaking and humility literatures to specify the dynamic processes through which humbling experiences are internalized, including contingency factors that limit or enhance the impact of these events. This approach adds theoretical precision to the understanding of what it means to have had a humbling experience and challenges the implicit assumption that humility is a stable quality. In addition, we inform the debate about how humility relates to negative emotions and self-views by distinguishing humility itself from the process through which it is developed. Throughout the paper, we use leadership as an illustrative context to ground our theorizing, but the processes we propose apply across organizational roles. Altogether, this work provides a foundation for better understanding how humbling experiences cultivate humility—an attribute that allows individuals to approach their roles from a more self-aware, other-oriented perspective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the wide adoption of performance management by organizations, there is little evidence that performance management works. In this paper, I critique both the methods and the goals of performance management. First, I note that performance management, through its reliance on top‐down decision making, robs workers of autonomy and responsibility. Next, I note that two of the three major components of performance management (aligning job performance goals with the strategic goals of the organization and using frequent informal feedback to manage performance) are flawed, and that efforts to manage performance using these tools are likely to fail. Rather than relying on managing performance, organizations should follow decades of research on supportive leadership and focus on supporting and facilitating performance rather than managing it. I call for more empirical research to evaluate the effectiveness of performance management and the effects of the various tools used to manage performance.</content>

    <title>CrossFit in the Crosshairs: A Community-Embedded Theory of Firm Responsiveness to Social Issues</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do community characteristics shape organizational responses to social issues? While existing research has focused primarily on firm-level attributes or issue characteristics, we argue that a community’s social structure systematically affects how external issues penetrate and resonate locally. We develop a theory of community permeability that links three structural features—network closure, segregation patterns, and issue connectedness—to both the local salience of social issues and subsequent firm responses. Our empirical analysis examines how thousands of locally owned CrossFit gyms in the U.S. responded to their CEO’s controversial statements following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a White police officer in 2020. Results show that issue salience was lower in communities characterized by stronger inward-focused ties and greater ethnic segregation but higher in communities more directly connected to populations affected by Floyd’s death. Firms operating in communities where the issue was more salient were more likely to respond, particularly when their dependence on community support was heightened by disruptions unrelated to the focal issue. Our study reveals how community social structure creates systematic variation in both issue salience and organizational responses, advancing understanding of when and why firms act on social issues.</content>

    <title>Cutting the apron strings: Establishing optimal distinctiveness from mentors in creative industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research has established that organizations benefit from “optimal distinctiveness,” that is, being sufficiently similar to and different from competitors. However, we know less about producers' strategic positioning choices to establish optimally distinctive identities. We explore this question through a qualitative study of chef‐owners who started their own restaurants after training with well‐known mentors. We identify two trajectories followed by chefs to establish optimal distinctiveness—legacy and divergent—and their components: interpersonal origins, strategic material and symbolic practices, tensions, and performance outcomes. Our study contributes to research by providing a more complete picture of how creative producers attempt to find an optimal balance between similarity to and difference from mentors, and the constraints they face in their strategic choices, including how these change over time.</content>

    <title>Reinvesting or Consuming Dividends: Account Structure Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is a long-standing fact that households mostly consume and rarely reinvest dividends. Among representative brokerage clients of one of Germany’s largest banks, we find the opposite: 80 percent reinvestments and 12 percent consumption. Of these reinvestments, the majority occurs with a delay after dividends are initially parked as brokerage cash. Motivated by this finding, we study payout modalities (deposits into brokerage accounts, checking accounts, or checks) as a novel mechanism that nudges investors toward reinvesting or consuming dividends. Consistent with a transition from checks to brokerage deposits, we find that the dividend consumption rate in the Consumer Expenditure Survey has decreased substantially over time.</content>

    <title>Regulatory consulting and banks’ financial reporting quality: evidence from the Dodd-Frank Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act expands bank managers’ reporting requirements to federal agencies, particularly relating to banks’ financial losses should common market and macroeconomic shocks occur. To comply with this regulation, bank managers have engaged in consulting arrangements (referred to as regulatory consulting). We examine the financial reporting quality implications associated with hiring external auditors for these services. We find banks with auditor-provided regulatory consulting, relative to banks without, have higher financial reporting quality as measured by loan loss provision validity. Consistent with knowledge spillover benefits accruing to financial audit teams, we find more pronounced effects in the fourth versus interim quarters and more frequent income-reducing Y9-C restatements. We also find auditor responsiveness to PCAOB inspections improves the effectiveness of regulatory consulting. Overall, our results suggest regulatory consulting improves the audits of estimates in judgmental financial statement accounts, despite regulatory concerns that these services may impair auditor independence.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Words Meet Visuals: How Content Composition Drives Social Media Engagement for Marketer-Generated Content</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the balance between text and pictorial content in marketer-generated social media posts affect user engagement? The authors address this question by using computer vision and natural language processing tools to extract the visual and textual features of 34,610 organic brand posts from Facebook and Instagram. Using a Confounding-and-Cluster-Robust Causal Forests model, they test how the balance of text and picture affects social media engagement across content and visual contexts. Results show that posts with greater emphasis on overlay text over pictorial content tend to have fewer likes and comments. However, the performance of text-oriented posts improves if text is more centered, informative, emotionally positive, and congruent with the pictorial content, and if the picture contains fewer prominent objects or less information such as social cues. They quantify how incremental changes in such content composition affect social media engagement. These findings set forth evidence-based principles for optimizing text and picture balance in marketer-generated content (MGC) and provide actionable guidelines on whether, where, when, and how to present text on an image. This research highlights the potential for transforming content and media creation from an imprecise art form into an empirical science nested within a data-driven visual optimization framework.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Trajectory of Confidence: Experience, Certainty, and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Confidence has an important influence on consumer behavior. Beyond what consumers know or believe, the confidence with which they hold those things (i.e., how certain they feel) shapes their judgments, decisions, and actions. But how does confidence shift as consumers gain experience? And what are the consequences for consumer choice? A multimethod investigation combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and experiments to examine these questions. Analysis of 3.7 million reviews from almost 100,000 consumers spanning nearly 30 years reveals a common confidence trajectory. Across diverse product categories (e.g., wine, beer, and cosmetics) there is a U-shaped relationship between experience and confidence. While gaining initial experience decreases confidence, eventually, with more experience, confidence rebounds. Further, feeling less confident leads consumers to avoid options associated with uncertainty and choose something different. This includes picking different products, avoiding brands associated with the uncertainty, and waiting longer to choose from those brands again. Taken together, this research sheds light on the evolution of confidence, how uncertainty shapes choice, and drivers of product switching and brand loyalty more generally.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of an MBA‐style executive education course in finance on corporate policies and firm performance targeting top managers of medium and large Mozambican enterprises. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the educational treatment induces changes in financial policies that improve firm performance. Specifically, a reduction in working capital (0.4 to 0.5 standard deviations) increases cash flow, and in turn long‐term investments. This effect operates primarily through a reduction in accounts receivable (0.4 to 1 standard deviations). Our findings show that targeted educational interventions can build managerial capital and enhance corporate performance by improving financial decision making among executives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of the U.S. money market fund reform implemented in October 2016 on global banks' funding supply and business activities. We show that the reform induced a large negative wholesale funding shock for global banks. In contrast to the conventional bank lending channel, the primary response of global banks to the reform was a cutback in arbitrage positions that relied on unsecured funding, rather than a reduction in loan provision. We discuss the role of postcrisis liquidity regulations and unconventional monetary policy in explaining our findings, and implications for banks' business models and deposit competition.</content>

Yet, despite the climate urgency and growing consumer concerns, the widespread adoption of sustainable behaviors has proven difficult. Why is this the case? How has the growing interdisciplinary field of sustainable consumption contributed to this debate? And where are the knowledge gaps? Guided by a comprehensive conceptual model, this article (a) delves into the keymarket,individual, and societalobstacles that hinder consumers from adopting more environmentally sustainable behaviors, (b) explores how practitioners and policymakers can help consumersminimizeorcircumventthese deterrents, and (c) highlights the pressing gaps in the literature, offering a roadmap for advancing our understanding of how to promote sustainable practices across the consumer journey—from search and purchase to usage and disposal.</content>

    <title>Toward Artificial Intelligence Compliance: Impacts and Mechanisms of Performance Feedback</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance performance, ensuring that employees use AI in compliance with organizational policies becomes crucial for realizing its full value. However, employees’ AI compliance is not guaranteed and can vary based on how their AI use is managed. This study offers timely and actionable insights into how performance feedback—both positive and negative—influences employees’ AI compliance, and how these effects vary with AI identity. Drawing on feedback intervention theory, we conduct a longitudinal field study and a randomized experiment and find that positive performance feedback promotes AI compliance, whereas negative performance feedback reduces it. Importantly, employees with high AI identity respond more strongly to both types of performance feedback. Our findings further uncover distinct underlying mechanisms—task-motivation, task-learning, and meta-cognitive processes—that channel the effects of positive and negative performance feedback on AI compliance. Taken together, organizations should tailor performance feedback as part of AI governance by considering employees’ AI identity. Positive reinforcement of AI compliance is especially effective for employees with high AI identity, whereas cautions are needed when delivering negative performance feedback to avoid undermining AI compliance. Policy guidelines should support identity-sensitive performance feedback in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research AbstractWe study how providing knowledge about “how to do entrepreneurship” influences women's pre‐entry decision to enroll in micro‐entrepreneurship training in poverty settings. We carry out a field experiment study with unemployed women in rural India, randomly exposing them to “founding templates” that depict simple and replicable business set‐ups and practices. We find that exposure to founding templates, especially those that exemplify social support rather than self‐dependence, significantly increases women's sign‐ups to entrepreneurship training. We also find that increased sign‐ups are accompanied by enhanced perceived ease of starting a business. These results shed light on what motivates women in the pre‐entry stage and offer insights on how to increase enrolment, ultimately broadening women's participation in entrepreneurship in poverty contexts.Managerial AbstractMicro‐entrepreneurship training is a widely used intervention to support women's participation in entrepreneurship in poverty settings. While existing research predominantly focuses on assessing the impact of such interventions, we ask when women are motivated to sign up for training in the first place. Our study involved a full‐day information workshop, targeting unemployed women in rural India and providing them with frameworks and practical examples of replicable business setups and practices. Results indicate that access to templates, especially those that exemplify social support rather than self‐dependence, significantly boosts women's confidence and motivation to consider entrepreneurship as a viable option. We thus identify a key institutional lever for broadening the funnel of women's entry into training and entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A New Perspective on Resilience in Flexible Supply SystemsSupply disruptions and demand uncertainty are persistent threats in today’s global operations landscape. In “Process Flexibility: A Distribution-Free Approach to Long Chain Resilience,” Chen, Chou, and Sun revisit the long-standing concept of long chain flexibility and demonstrate its resilience in the face of supply-side risks. By deriving a closed-form bound on expected sales relative to full flexibility, the study offers a robust, distribution-free guarantee that highlights the long chain’s ability to hedge against disruptions. The authors further generalize their findings using a novel moment decomposition approach, extending applicability to a broader range of service metrics and capacity-demand scenarios via semidefinite programming. Their results not only reaffirm the demand-pooling power of long chains but also position them as a highly resilient configuration in disrupted environments, offering practical insights for capacity planning in uncertain supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper makes the first comprehensive attempt to study within‐country heterogeneity of housing returns. We introduce a new city‐level data set covering 15 OECD countries over 150 years and show that national housing markets are characterized by systematic spatial variation in housing returns. Total returns in large agglomerations are close to 100 basis points lower per year than in other parts of the same country. Excess returns outside the large cities can be rationalized as compensation for higher risk, especially higher covariance with income growth and lower liquidity. Real estate in diversified large agglomerations is comparatively safe.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing frequency of information security breaches and the rising importance of cybersecurity have prompted many firms to include chief information security officers (CISOs) in their top management teams (TMTs). Although CISOs are often viewed narrowly through a security-focused lens, our research shows that their inclusion in TMTs can offer a strategic advantage by significantly enhancing firm innovation. We identify three mechanisms that explain this effect: (1) reducing preventable security risks that might otherwise hinder innovation efforts; (2) enabling the adoption of innovation technologies (e.g., cloud computing, big data) that carry strategic security risks; and (3) strengthening security controls that protect intellectual property and mitigate innovation-related threats. Importantly, the CISO’s background matters. Those with specialized experience—either in the same industry or with prior executive roles—have a stronger impact on driving innovation. This research illuminates how CISOs’ presence on TMTs affects firms’ value creation from a security risk management perspective, and provides guidance for firms seeking to hire CISOs for innovation.</content>

    <title>Geographical Pattern of Online Word of Mouth: How Offline Environment Influences Online Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key feature of e-commerce is the access to a wide range of geographical areas; e-commerce platforms spend much effort customizing their strategies across geographical areas. Meanwhile, online word of mouth (WOM) is becoming an increasingly important driver for product sales on e-commerce platforms. This study investigates the geographical pattern of online WOM. Specifically, we examine whether and how customers’ local environment influences the generation and direction of online WOM. Leveraging a unique research design, we measure the online WOM at a U.S. national e-commerce platform by tracking the WOM referral decisions of customers. Whereas digital technologies have enabled customers to share without physical boundaries, we find that location still plays significant roles in the generation and direction of online WOM. First, a customer’s offline social environment (e.g., friend visiting frequency, neighbor interactions) significantly explains the generation of online referrals. Second, online referrals are largely bounded locally, and referrals in areas with more local social interactions are more likely to stay local. Third, even when referrals travel far, they are more likely to point to destinations socially similar to the origins. We derive important implications for firms in allocating resources across geographical areas and in using referrals to identify high-potential geographical markets.</content>

    <title>Does earnings management matter for strategy research?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic management research often uses accounting data, despite well‐known concerns that earnings management could obscure the link between actual and measured performance. We apply methods from the econometric literature on bunching to estimate that around 15 percent of firm‐year observations in Compustat manipulate accounting earnings to achieve profitability. We show that cash‐based performance measures are less susceptible to manipulation and that the choice of accrual versus cash‐based measures “matters” for two classic strategy research questions: a decomposition of ROA variance and an analysis of persistence in firm performance. These findings underscore the importance of robustness testing and contribute to an emerging literature that reconsiders the link between theoretical constructs and empirical performance measures.Managerial SummaryTo understand what drives firm performance, researchers and practitioners often rely on reported accounting measures from annual reports. The most commonly used income‐based measures are strategically inflated or deflated through accounting and operational choices (i.e., earnings management). This article finds that approximately 15 percent of the time that ROA is reported for a fiscal year, a loss would have been reported instead of a gain if not for this manipulation. We then analyze the impact earnings management has on two types of profitability analysis by comparing accrual‐based or cash‐based profit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article extends the rare disaster framework by introducing a model with a time-varying disaster recovery feature. The model yields closed-form pricing formulas for stocks and dividend strips. Calibrated using international disaster data, it quantitatively captures both the unconditional and conditional term structures of equity risk premia. It replicates key empirical patterns, including a downward-sloping unconditional term structure of one-period returns and a countercyclical conditional slope, and generates novel predictions for capital asset pricing model beta, alpha, and price.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Analytical Insights on Inventory AllocationHow should a limited inventory of a single resource be allocated across multiple customer groups with distinct rewards and arrival rates, especially when each group has a finite population? In their paper “Optimal allocation of limited inventory among multiclass customers with finite populations” in Operations Research, the authors develop a stochastic framework and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process. By analyzing the structure of the optimal value function, they reveal a new insight; rather than gradually expanding access to lower-priority groups over time, it is in fact optimal to progressively restrict access to these groups. The paper also introduces a fluid model with an explicit solution, which provides a good approximation when the system size is large. These findings offer both theoretical and practical contributions to inventory allocation problems, with potential applications in healthcare and humanitarian resource management as well as commercial product sales.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use newly assembled data overall encompassing up to 75 countries and starting circa 1910, to study impediments to the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction as it “proceeds by competitively destroying old businesses.” Political connections appear to represent an obstacle to the destructive part of the Schumpeterian process in the replacement of large firms. When accompanied by regulations that restrict entry, political connections can play a role in allowing large firms to remain large. When connected to Fogel, Morck, and Yeung (2008,Journal of Financial Economics89, 83–108), the results imply that political connections, combined with barriers to entry, can retard economic development.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Reducing Visibility of Friends’ Liked Content on User Content Engagement Across Newsfeed Channels</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nowadays, online platforms constantly adjust their newsfeeds to boost engagement, often emphasizing nonsocial channels such as algorithmic recommendations over social ones such as user networks. However, ignoring the interactions between these channels can have unintended consequences. This study delves into this by assessing the impacts of a policy change that reduced the visibility of friends’ liked content on a major discussion platform. We found this led to an overall decrease in users’ content engagement. Although users engaged more with their friends’ original posts and trending topics, their interaction with nonsocial content such as algorithmic recommendations decreased. This reveals a key insight: social channels act as substitutes for one another but are complementary to nonsocial, algorithmic channels. Vibrant social activity is crucial for driving traffic to other parts of a platform. Crucially, the change also made users’ content engagement less diverse. Friends’ liked content is a key source of exposure to niche topics. For platform operators, this means that sidelining social features in favor of algorithmic feeds can backfire, reducing overall engagement and diversity. For policymakers concerned about online echo chambers, our findings suggest that content shared through extended social networks is vital for promoting a wider range of content.</content>

    <title>The use of client-engaged specialists to support opportunistic estimates: evidence from the insurance industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use unique disclosures in the insurance industry to examine whether client-engaged specialists (i.e., external actuaries) affect opportunism within the claim loss reserve. Using a fixed-effects approach, we find that external actuaries significantly affect the opportunism in the claim loss reserve, approaching half the effect of the auditor. With respect to actuary characteristics, we find a positive (negative) association between actuary permissiveness (actuary size) and opportunism in the claim loss reserve. In additional analyses, we find that the relation between actuary permissiveness and claim loss reserve opportunism is stronger when insurers have incentives to opportunistically manage the claim loss reserve. This relation continues to persist in the presence of high-quality auditors. Overall, we provide evidence suggesting that client-engaged external actuaries can be used to support opportunistic claim loss reserve estimates.</content>

    <title>When Do Gender-Diverse Teams Engage More Investors? Evidence of Threshold Alignment Benefits at Techstars</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through an observational field study involving quantitative and qualitative components, we explore the role of gender diversity in shaping the effectiveness of mentorship for founder teams seeking investors. Data on 984 teams of founders assigned to teams of mentors at Techstars-run accelerator programs around the world demonstrate the interteam benefits of aligned gender diversity thresholds: Founder teams characterized by the presence (absence) of gender diversity engage more investors when matched with mentor teams also characterized by the presence (absence) of gender diversity. Neither the presence of gender diversity in the founder team nor the presence of gender diversity in the mentor team exerts a positive influence on investor counts as a standalone factor, but the aligned presence of intrateam gender diversity helps ventures maximize participating investors. We find that the number of participating investors has a positive downstream impact, increasing the amount of funding that the venture raises. Results are robust to the inclusion of controls for venture, founder, and mentor characteristics, with clustering at the Techstars cohort level. Qualitative insights from 20 semistructured interviews reveal how interteam gender alignment facilitates interpersonal attraction, whereas intrateam gender diversity enables resource acquisition. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this phenomenon for internal-external team interactions in venture funding and beyond.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2025.20141 .</content>

    <title>Fairness-Aware Online Price Discrimination with Nonparametric Demand Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating Fairness into Online Price DiscriminationIn the paper “Fairness-aware online price discrimination with nonparametric demand models,” Xi Chen, Jiameng Lyu, Xuan Zhang, and Yuan Zhou explore how fairness can be integrated into dynamic pricing strategies. The authors propose a model that enforces price fairness constraints, ensuring that price differences between customer groups remain within a specified range. Their approach introduces a novel regret lower bound, which contrasts with the typical regret seen in traditional pricing algorithms. This shift underscores the added complexity of optimizing revenue while maintaining fairness. The study not only advances the understanding of fairness-aware dynamic pricing but also enriches the dynamic pricing literature by offering new lower-bound techniques. These insights may be useful for deriving lower bounds in other problems related to learning optimal prices under constraints. Their work contributes significantly to the growing need for ethical pricing practices in data-driven markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two Prices Unlock Big Gains for Reusable ResourcesHow much sophistication is needed to price reusable resources, like hotel rooms and cloud computing, when usage durations are not memoryless? Surprisingly little. In “Dynamic Pricing for Reusable Resources: The Power of Two Prices,” Balseiro, Ma, and Zhang propose a class of dynamic stock-dependent policies that achieve significant improvements over static pricing by only looking at how many units are busy and ignoring how long they have been busy. Using an “insensitivity” property of loss networks, they show that optimizing within this policy class can be formulated as a tractable convex optimization problem. Better yet, the performance loss of the optimal stock-dependent policy can be achieved by a simple two-price policy: charge a high price when inventory falls below a threshold and a low price otherwise. Extensions to multiple resources and customer classes, together with extensive simulations, confirm that “just a little” dynamicity can go a long way.</content>

    <title>On‐Demand Schedules, Worker Absenteeism and Patient Dissatisfaction in Home Care Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service companies often adopt on‐demand scheduling to balance labor costs and fluctuating market demand. However, research shows that such practices can reduce worker productivity and retention. In this study, we examine how on‐demand scheduling affects two critical outcomes: worker absenteeism and patient dissatisfaction. We extend the conceptualization of undesirable scheduling by introducingschedule discontinuity—the presence of unpaid interruptions within a worker's daily schedule—alongside the more commonly studiedschedule inconsistency, or variability in work hours across weeks. Using data on 1.2 million home care visits in a Canadian healthcare provider, we find that both schedule inconsistency and discontinuity significantly increase absenteeism and patient dissatisfaction. Specifically, moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in discontinuity (inconsistency) raises absenteeism by 20.00% (19.29%), and customer complaints by 27.33% (40.27%). To assess the practical implications for employers, we formulate and solve a schedule optimization problem that minimizes schedule discontinuity (or inconsistency), while satisfying demand and supply constraints. Applying a machine learning predictive model to these optimized schedules, we estimate reductions in the probability of absenteeism by 9.5% (8.2%) and in the probability of patient complaints by 7.7% (2.3%), demonstrating that modest scheduling adjustments can substantially improve worker and service outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a pricing kernel with time-varying volatility risk aversion to explain the observed time variations in the shape of the pricing kernel. When combined with the Heston-Nandi GARCH model, this framework yields a tractable option pricing model in which the variance risk ratio (VRR) emerges as a key variable. We show that the VRR is closely linked to economic fundamentals, as well as sentiment and uncertainty measures. A novel approximation method provides analytical option pricing formulas, and we demonstrate substantial reductions in pricing errors through an empirical application to the S&amp;P 500 index, the CBOE VIX, and option prices.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating Expert Views into Investment ModelsHow can investors best incorporate forward-looking expert views into dynamic portfolio strategies? “Dynamic Black-Litterman,” by Anas Abdelhakmi and Andrew Lim, offers a novel solution.The authors generalize the classic Black-Litterman model to a dynamic setting, allowing for continuous trading and expert views of events over varying time horizons that arrive over time. They derive the explicit dynamics of asset prices after incorporating these views, uncovering a surprising and elegant connection to multidimensional Brownian bridges.Remarkably, the paper provides a closed-form solution for the optimal dynamic portfolio policy, a significant finding for a model of this complexity. This includes a specific hedging component to protect against changes in expert views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach consistently outperforms strategies that repeatedly apply the single-period model, leading to higher returns and lower portfolio turnover.</content>

    <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Day-ahead electricity auctions allow market participants to trade power for delivery the following day. In Europe, these auctions are designed as combinatorial auctions, enabling agents to submit package bids (“block bids”) that span multiple time periods rather than bidding separately for each hour. However, power exchanges impose limits on the number of package bids an agent can submit, creating a complex decision problem: Which packages should an agent bid on to best represent their preferences? In “Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives,” Hübner and Hug study this selection problem and propose decision-support algorithms that optimize bid choice under uncertainty. They provide theoretical bounds on welfare loss due to bid limits and validate their methods with simulations involving generators, storage systems, and flexible demand. Their findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and bidders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on a comprehensive data set of classified (staggered) boards covering nearly all U.S. public firms from 1991 to 2020, we show that contrary to conventional wisdom, the use of classified boards remains widespread. Moreover, classified board usage over a firm's life cycle depends significantly on the decade the firm matured or year it went public. While classified boards were rarely removed in the 1990s, firms became more likely to declassify as they matured during the following decades. Decreased collective action costs and increased innovation‐related investments, institutional ownership, and scrutiny of governance contributed to this more dynamic adjustment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new measure of firms' disclosure based on company websites, which are widely available and contain a wealth of information. For a sample of U.S. public firms, we construct our disclosure measure using historical website data, validate it by correlating it with extant measures of disclosure and information asymmetry, and explore its determinants. We then apply our measure to the study of U.S. private firms' disclosure and French firms' compliance with a nonfinancial disclosure mandate. Our applications illustrate that our website‐based measure provides a useful complement to extant measures of disclosure, which are more narrowly focused on investors in public capital markets.</content>

    <title>Sponsored Tasks and Solver Participation in Crowdsourcing Contests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing platforms provide venues for firms looking for solutions (seekers) to interact with individuals who can provide solutions (solvers). As crowdsourcing contest platforms have grown in popularity, with numerous tasks being posted on a daily basis, a concern that has emerged is that many similar tasks compete for solver attention, with some tasks failing to attract sufficient solver participation. To alleviate this concern, in addition to regular task listings, many crowdsourcing platforms offer sponsorship programs under which seekers pay an extra fee for highlighting their tasks to draw solvers’ attention. We examine the effect of sponsorship on solver participation using a unique data set collected from a leading crowdsourcing platform. In contrast to platforms’ claims about the effect of sponsorship on participation, we find that sponsorship does not always boost participation in crowdsourcing contests; sponsorship increases the number of participants only when the task’s prize amount is already high. Furthermore, even when the number of participants increases, the increase comes primarily from low-ability solvers. We also find that when sponsorship increases the total number of submissions, it does so only by increasing the number of participants; sponsorship does not increase the number of submissions that individual solvers submit after joining a task. More granular analyses reveal an effect of anticipated increased competition caused by sponsorship on high-ability solvers that is not observed on those of low ability, explaining the difference in their participation decisions when facing sponsored tasks. We also find that the effect of sponsorship weakens over the duration of a task for high-ability solvers and is also weaker for solvers with more experience on the platform.History: Yong Tan, Senior Editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2021.0246 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how autonomous Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams prioritize competing financial and social goals during 9‐1‐1 calls. Prior research highlights organization‐level solutions that enable single‐goal pursuit, but it remains unclear how frontline professionals manage competing goals that are interdependent and inseparable during task execution. We argue EMS teams will dynamically prioritize goals across calls depending on contextual factors. Using quasi‐random assignment of 9‐1‐1 patients to EMS crews in 31 US states, we find that crews prioritize the financial goal on private insurance calls but shift toward the social goal when agency financial need is low or call acuity is high. Surprisingly, these patterns are most pronounced in non‐profit EMS agencies. Our study offers new insight into how professionals manage goal trade‐offs in real time.Managerial SummaryWhat happens when professionals must pursue competing goals—like financial performance and equitable service—but organizations cannot separate them across tasks? Using data from 31 US states, we examine how Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams navigate this tension during 9‐1‐1 calls. We find that crews dynamically prioritize goals based on perceived risk and opportunity—even without managerial intervention or immediate incentives. Teams provide more services to privately insured patients to increase revenue but shift toward equitable care when patient needs are more urgent or agency finances are stable. Surprisingly, these trade‐offs are most pronounced in non‐profit agencies. Our findings suggest that when goals collide within tasks, managers can shape frontline decision‐making by influencing how professionals understand goal risk and opportunity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock returns exhibit reversals at short horizons but slowly transition to momentum over longer horizons. To help understand this pattern, we develop a multiperiod model with short- and long-horizon noise traders, and active investors who underreact to information they do not themselves produce. The model accords with the transition from reversals to momentum and yields the following novel predictions: (a) attenuated reversals after earnings announcements, (b) a negative relation between monthly reversal and longer-term momentum profits across economies and time, and (c) larger reversals when there is more noise trading. Empirical analysis using U.S. and international data supports these predictions. (JEL G12, G14, G41)</content>

    <title>The Confirmation Nudge: Prompts to Change or Confirm Initial Preferences Steer Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Across two field experiments and several pre-registered laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that confirmation nudges, which ask consumers whether they would like to confirm or change their initial choice, impact choice. First, consumers navigating a subscription company’s smartphone app were randomized to a control or confirmation nudge condition, which asked them to either confirm their initial choice or switch to an annual subscription. Confirmation nudges increased subscribers’ choice of the annual subscription by over 8 percentage points–an effect size similar to default effects tested by the same company. In Experiment 2, conducted by a jewelry retailer, confirmation nudges had countervailing effects, increasing purchases of a nudged service plan add-on, but decreasing originally-planned jewelry purchases likely because it added a step and thus frictions to the purchase process. Confirmation nudges had larger effects when nudged options were desirable and among consumers who would benefit from the nudge (Experiments 3-4). But, they were perceived as more manipulative than comparison conditions (Experiment 5). We suggest that confirmation nudges undo tendencies to focus on initially-preferred options, shifting attention towards alternatives relative to control conditions. Consistent with this, confirmation nudges were especially effective when the wording of the confirmation prompt focused on the “switch” option.</content>

    <title>Is There Fairness in AI?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly steer workplace decisions, debates around fairness have intensified. Existing research often approaches fairness either as a set of universal principles supported or undermined by algorithms, or as a product of social interpretations, thereby providing either technologically deterministic or purely social accounts. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a human resources (HR) department of a large international company that introduced AI in hiring, this study offers an alternative view that shifts focus to how fairness emerges through the ways people define, embed, and perform values with algorithms. Taking a sociomaterial perspective, we find that the introduction and use of AI resulted in crowding out expert practices of performing fairness, favouring instead the version performed by HR. Our process model explains this outcome by the growing symbiosis between HR's professional mandate for fairness and AI procedures, where each legitimizes, shapes, and protects the other over time. This study thus shows that fairness is not pre‐given but constantly redefined and enacted through evolving associations between professional mandates and AI technologies.</content>

    <title>Not All Political Ties Are the Same: Firms’ Ties to the Government and Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complementing research on the implications of political ties for firms’ strategic decisions and financial performance, recent studies are increasingly focusing on the environmental consequences of firms’ political connections. We contribute to this stream of work by integrating insights from the literature on political ties and the multifaceted nature of governments to explore how the level of government influences the pollution implications of firms’ political ties. Specifically, we theorize and demonstrate that, in China, firms’ achieved political ties with high levels of the government reduce pollution, while such ties with low levels of the government increase it. Furthermore, we examine how these relationships are moderated by firm owners’ social class and the attention by different levels of the government to their respective primary goals. Our analysis of data from 6,758 privately-owned Chinese enterprises provides support for our predictions. Our main conceptual contribution is to add more nuance to the research on political ties by highlighting the contingent role of the level of government in shaping firms’ pollution outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on performance feedback presents conflicting views on how above‐aspiration performance influences organizational change. Some studies argue that it constrains change due to a lack of organizational motivation, while others suggest that it enables change by expanding managerial discretion. Reconciling these perspectives, we suggest that managers’ narcissistic tendencies can fundamentally alter how a firm responds to above‐aspiration performance. We theorize and find evidence that high‐narcissism CEOs respond to above‐aspiration performance with more acquisitions—attention‐generating actions that align with their self‐enhancement motives, while under similar conditions low‐narcissism CEOs avoid acquisitions, due to their uncertainty and risk. Our findings highlight the interplay between managerial discretion and personal motivations in shaping strategic responses to performance feedback, offering new insights into the role of executive personality in corporate decision‐making.Managerial SummaryDo successful firms pursue bold strategic moves—or play it safe when firm performance is strong? Our study seeks to answer this question and reconcile conflicting findings about how above‐aspiration performance influences managers’ decisions to undertake risky organizational change, such as corporate acquisitions. We show that it depends on CEO narcissism. High‐narcissism CEOs—who seek attention, hold an inflated self‐view, and are more egoistic—are motivated to initiate bold, high‐risk changes like acquisitions. In contrast, low‐narcissism CEOs—who avoid challenging tasks, hold a modest self‐view, and are sensitive to negative evaluation—are motivated to avoid bold, high‐risk changes like acquisitions. By showing how CEO narcissism affects firms’ risky change actions, we offer new insights into the role of executive personality in corporate decision‐making.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Breaking Barriers: Improving Patient Adherence to Appointments and Provider Productivity through Telehealth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Telehealth services became popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet their operational impacts on healthcare organizations are not well-understood. Patient behaviors can vary significantly between telehealth and in-person appointments, introducing new challenges and opportunities for healthcare delivery. We examine two key behaviors contributing to non-adherence to medical appointments: no-shows and unpunctuality. Analyzing 412,415 telehealth and inperson appointments across a major US medical system from 2020 to 2022, we find that telehealth appointments reduce no-shows by 3.0 percentage points (23.1%) and late-arrivals by 11.4 percentage points (35.6%), indicating significant improvements in appointment adherence. We also find that telehealth is particularly effective in improving adherence to follow-up appointments but may be less suitable for initial consultations with new patients. In addition, telehealth improves adherence most among demographic groups with historically lower in-person attendance – women, racial minorities, Medicaid patients, and younger adults – underscoring its potential to reduce disparities in access. Our analysis suggests that while telehealth may increase patient revisit rates and create extra work for providers, the gains from reduced no-shows, particularly for follow-ups, lead to a net boost in provider productivity. Finally, we explore the best strategies to integrate telehealth into a provider’s daily scheduling template, showing that scheduling telehealth appointments before in-person visits enhances operational efficiency compared to the opposite sequence. Policymakers should recognize telehealth’s capacity to improve appointment adherence, reduce disparities, and enhance productivity, and support its adoption through appropriate regulations. Healthcare organizations should strategically deploy telehealth to address the root causes of patient non-adherence. By offering telehealth appointments to patients facing barriers to in-person care, they can simultaneously optimize both access and productivity.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Global Sourcing for Supply Resilience in the Presence of Emergency Contract Renegotiation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In light of the recent frequency of global emergencies that result in overseas delivery delays and cost surges, many multinational brands consider reshaping their sourcing configurations by incorporating local suppliers that may be of lower quality than globally selected counterparts. In this global context, pre-committed emergency renegotiation clauses have gained recognition as a common practice in international commercial contracts, which enable contractual parties to adjust key terms, such as the wholesale price and order quantity, during ex-post emergencies. This work aims to investigate how the presence of overseas emergency renegotiation affects the brand’s strategy preference for dual versus single sourcing and the decision-making of supply chain parties. By comparing with two widely observed benchmark scenarios—contract termination and contract continuation at post-recovery cost—that exclude overseas emergency renegotiation, we show that in the presence of emergency renegotiation, the overseas supplier under both sourcing strategies may lower its wholesale price for the brand in response to a higher delay probability, which would not be the case in the contract termination benchmark. This price-cutting effect encourages the brand to order more from the overseas supplier, even if the delay probability is high. Furthermore, the brand favors dual sourcing if the overseas post-recovery unit cost is either low or high, driven by a distinct incentive under renegotiation: the local supplier may suppress the local rival by setting a high wholesale price, a scenario not possible in the contract continuation benchmark. Our study highlights the value of emergency contract renegotiation in reshaping resilient sourcing strategies for multinational brands facing global emergencies, even with ex-post local reorder or overseas quality deterioration during recovery.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The placement of facilities in service regions with continuously distributed demand poses a difficult problem, often requiring discretization methods that can potentially introduce approximation errors. This study presents a robust approach to address this challenge of continuous spatial distribution by considering the problem of facility placement under the spatial uncertainty associated with future demand locations, without resorting to discretization and its associated errors. We propose a spatial-data-driven optimization approach to deal with the key challenges, namely the continuous region of potential demands, sparse historical demands, and non-stationarity of the spatial distribution of demands. To this end, we model the spatial uncertainty using a Wasserstein distance based spatial ambiguity set, wherein we leverage popular clustering algorithms to form subregions to explicitly capture the spatial structure of demand occurrences. This proposed spatial ambiguity set does not require the discretization and demand aggregation approach commonly employed in the literature, while still maintaining the optimization tractability. Following a distributionally robust optimization framework with the proposed spatial ambiguity set, the problem is reformulated as a mixed integer semi-infinite optimization problem, which is then solved by our row-and-column generation algorithm. To study the practical performance, we conduct a numerical study in the emergency response context with the real data of fatal road traffic accidents in the city of Leeds, UK. Numerical results suggest that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks and attains facility locations that can potentially provide shorter response times to future demand occurrences. In particular, our proposed approach attains an out-of-sample performance improvement of 7–9% over the sample average approximation approach and an improvement of 5–8% over the discretization and demand aggregation approach under higher future spatial uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic Servers with Individual Preferences in Heavy TrafficAgents in service systems are known to strategically adjust their service speeds to maximize idle time. “Many-Server Queueing Systems with Heterogeneous Strategic Servers in Heavy Traffic” by Büke, dos Reis, and Platonov is the first work to rigorously examine strategic heterogeneous servers in queueing systems. The authors address this technically challenging problem using a novel asymptotic framework that provides valuable insights into equilibrium behavior. The analysis goes beyond existing literature by incorporating a remarkably general class of utility functions and routing policies, allowing for variation in agents’ marginal utility of idleness. One of the key results shows that the celebrated square-root staffing rule retains its optimality—even in the presence of strategic behavior—when agents are sufficiently averse to low levels of idleness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As AI-powered negotiations spread, their psychological and relational impact remains unclear. We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that trains a bot to aim for superior economic outcomes while appearing “human” (“algorithmic anthropomorphization”). In a bargaining game experiment, we compare this “superhuman” bot to two simpler alternatives: a bot that mimics human behavior and a purely efficient bot. Our results show that (a) superficial anthropomorphization can make a bot seem human but does not improve subjective evaluations, (b) the efficient bot is so rational it is easily exploited, undercutting its performance, and (c) the superhuman bot achieves superior economic results while appearing more human than actual humans. Yet even when bots act indistinguishably from humans, they may trigger an “uncanny valley” effect, lowering subjective evaluations regardless of performance. Because subjective evaluations predict future negotiation outcomes, these findings highlight the potential negative impact AI bargaining algorithms can have on long-term customer relationships. We urge firms to measure more than objective outcomes when assessing AI negotiators.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multiple Unit Offers and Rate Calculations: How Rates Influence Price and Promotion Sensitivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers are often faced with multiple unit offers (e.g., $40 for 5 lbs of coffee) in the marketplace and must figure out how to evaluate them. While the total price (e.g., $40) is always provided, the associated rate information is not (e.g., $8/lb for coffee). The focus of this research is on understanding the role that these rates play in influencing consumer decision-making. The authors find that regardless of whether rates are provided by managers or calculated by consumers, consumers are more sensitive to promotional offers with dollar per unit (vs. unit per dollar) rates because dollar per unit rates increase price salience. Additionally, when rate information is not provided, the authors document how these rates are computed by consumers. The authors find that consumers prefer to use the larger numerosity element as their rate’s numerator, which leads to calculating units per dollar rates when the multiple unit offer’s quantity is larger in numerosity than the price but dollars per unit rates when price is larger in numerosity than the quantity. The authors discuss theoretical, practical, and policy implications.</content>

    <title>The More, the Merrier? Membership Expansion and Incumbents' Boundary Work Divergence in the Platformization of Belgian Philanthropy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When actors emerge on the periphery of a field, incumbents either engage in protective boundary work to enforce the field's membership criteria, or opt for membership expansion by adapting these criteria to accommodate peripheral actors. Less explored is the divergence configuration where a minority of incumbents pursue expansion whereas the majority adopt a protective strategy. Since the inclusion of peripheral actors may challenge membership criteria (i.e., the symbolic boundary) and shift the resource distribution and social hierarchy (i.e., the social boundary), how minority incumbents induce membership expansion against the majority's protective stance is an intriguing question. Drawing on a qualitative field‐level case study of Belgian philanthropy, we examine incumbent foundations' responses to the rise of ‘social‐mission platforms.’ We identify four mechanisms through which minority incumbents can overcome the majority's initial opposition and bring about support to membership expansion: affirming divergent expansive posture, leveraging definitional ambiguity, demonstrating comparative reinforcement, and facilitating shared buy‐in. We further show how each mechanism bridges the social and symbolic boundaries through the combined (re)actions of the diverging incumbents and the peripheral actors. Our findings extend understandings of membership expansion as a contested, multi‐actor process and unpack the interaction of social and symbolic boundaries in shaping field evolution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Farmer, Schmidt, and Timmermann (FST) document time‐variation in market return predictability, identifying “pockets” of significant predictability through kernel regressions. However, our analysis reveals a critical discrepancy between the method outlined by FST and the code actually implemented. Instead of using a one‐sided kernel, which guarantees out‐of‐sample forecasts, they perform in‐sample estimation with a two‐sided kernel. As a result, future information leaks into the forecasting model, undermining its reliability. Rectifying this error qualitatively alters the findings, invalidating most conclusions of the FST study. Thus, attempts to exploit such “pockets”—should they exist—offer little help in forecasting market returns.</content>

    <title>Fairness Perceptions in Demographic Targeting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deciding which customer segment(s) to serve, or targeting, is a cornerstone of marketing strategy. While companies commonly target based on demographic characteristics, recent cultural movements (e.g., #MeToo, Black Lives Matter) have heightened sensitivity to the differential treatment of certain demographic groups. Yet research to date has not examined whether demographic targeting itself seems fair or appropriate. Fourteen experiments (N = 9,399), 13 supplemental studies (N = 7,065), and two Facebook A/B Tests (N = 513,151) reveal that when consumers learn or infer that they or others have been targeted based on demographic characteristics, fairness perceptions and brand support suffer (relative to broad advertising). To explain why, we propose a conceptual model based on the extent to which consumers view demographic targeting as discriminatory (ie, differential treatment based on attributes that are irrelevant and/or uncontrollable), and whether the discrimination is perceived as intentional (ie, knowingly or willingly bringing about an avoidable outcome). Consequently, factors that (a) improve relevance (ie, whether belonging to the targeted segment is diagnostic of preferences) or (b) increase controllability (ie, whether consumers themselves determine their membership in the targeted segment) attenuate perceptions of unfairness, as do variables that (c) reduce perceived intentionality (e.g., firm size, industry norms).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper empirically studies the effects of the early law-and-economics movement on the U.S. judiciary. We focus on the Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges, an intensive economics course that trained almost half of federal judges between 1976 and 1999. Using the universe of published opinions in U.S. Circuit Courts and 1 million District Court criminal sentencing decisions, we estimate the within-judge effect of Manne program attendance. Selection into attendance was limited, as the program was popular among judges of all backgrounds, frequently oversubscribed, and admitted participants on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that after attending economics training, participating judges use more economics language in their opinions, rule against regulatory agencies more often, and impose more severe criminal sentences. We argue that economics, as a rigorous social science, was especially effective in persuading judges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should a large investor trade when their actions influence—and are influenced by—others in the market? This paper investigates optimal execution in financial markets where order flow is endogenous and governed by self-exciting dynamics. Market order arrivals are modeled using a Hawkes process, with intensity shaped by the trader’s own activity—capturing a feedback loop between execution and market response. The study considers both risk-neutral and risk-averse investors under market impact, deriving closed-form and semi–closed-form optimal strategies. In the risk-averse case, the solution skews execution toward earlier periods to mitigate inventory risk. The model is also extended to more general Hawkes kernels, enhancing practical applicability. The findings shed light on how sophisticated traders can minimize execution costs while accounting for the risk of being tracked in increasingly transparent markets. This work offers actionable insights for algorithmic execution under realistic microstructure dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a search and bargaining model of over‐the‐counter markets for nonstandardized assets of heterogeneous quality. Once matched, investors privately learn their values positively correlated with asset quality. Bargaining results in delay that is hump‐shaped in quality and U‐shaped in asset turnover. We document these patterns in commercial real estate and corporate bonds markets. Extreme qualities are little affected by changes in asset standardization, while intermediate qualities are more susceptible. For nonstandardized assets, opacity ensures active trading of all assets, which explains why their trading is decentralized and suggests that trade centralization should come with greater standardization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although everyone must make decisions about where to live, we know little about how consumers perceive social interactions with neighbors and incorporate information about neighbors into their residence decisions. This article explores the impact of consumers' self‐construal on the importance they attribute to neighbor information when choosing a residence. Across seven preregistered studies, including lab experiments and online surveys, the findings consistently show that independent consumers, compared with interdependent ones, place greater importance on information about potential neighbors. This tendency stems from independent consumers' stronger desire for social closeness with neighbors, prompting them to place more weight on information that will help them find neighbors with whom they could become friends.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital streamers gain popularity in live commerce, online retailers face critical questions about the actual business value of their operations. This study offers timely, evidence-based insights into the economic impact and optimal design of digital streamers. Although current designs do not significantly improve sales over no live streaming, incorporating behavioral realism—especially enhanced real-time question and answer (Q&amp;A)—can boost sales by 25%, making digital streamers as effective as human hosts. Visual upgrades and human-like voices also help but to a lesser degree. Importantly, not all AI-driven enhancements deliver immediate returns, and imitating human scripts does not guarantee success. Retailers should focus on dynamic human-AI interaction features that drive engagement and trust, such as real-time Q&amp;A and interactive giveaways. Designers are encouraged to integrate multiple realism features to maximize effectiveness while managing cost and scalability. These findings offer actionable guidance for retailers and platform designers seeking to leverage AI effectively and cost efficiently in live streaming commerce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What human capital do established organizations need to bring new ideas to market? Combining Danish registry and Community Innovation Survey data, we document a robust positive relationship between hiring former founders and firms' sales from innovation. Entrepreneurs join smaller, younger firms (which exhibit larger effects), managerial skills and external industry founding experience matter, while other selection or human capital‐based explanations appear muted. Founder hires especially enhance innovation when given middle management decision rights, for incremental offerings, and in innovation‐active firms. Our collective findings indicate startup experience equips founders with a generalist ability to acquire and mobilize resources around new ideas. By clarifying the nature of entrepreneurial human capital, we highlight a novel innovation input that helps firms unlock its commercial value.Managerial SummaryAs entrepreneurial careers proliferate, former founders represent a growing pool of potential employees with expertise in bringing new products and services to market. Can hiring entrepreneurs help established organizations enhance innovation? Using data from Denmark, we answer this question affirmatively and offer several explanations. Former founders gravitate towards younger, smaller established firms, where effects are stronger; they also bring valuable managerial skills and external industry founding experience. Notably, they generate more value when given broader authority as middle managers, for less obvious resource combinations, firms already active in innovation or research and development, and higher uncertainty contexts. Taken together, our findings suggest former founders' distinct combination of skills helps firms marshal resources around new offerings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;After medical marijuana legalization (MML) by U.S. states, firms’ cost of equity (COE) decreases, especially for those with more growth opportunities, higher productivity, or a more skilled workforce. This policy change also reduces firm risk and leads to an increase in labor supply through increased labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and net migration. Further, home prices rise after MML, reflecting increased local housing demand due to a growing supply of workers. These findings align with theoretical models that link asset prices to labor markets and suggest that MML can lower firms’ COE by mitigating labor search frictions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the effects of a multiday cyberattack that forced offline a technology service provider (TSP) to the banking sector. The attack impaired customers’ ability to send payments through the TSP, but the business continuity plans of banks and the TSP reduced the effect by more than half. Large banks performed better. Through contagion, banks not directly exposed to the attack experienced a liquidity shortfall, causing them to borrow funds or tap reserves. The ability to send payments after hours helped avoid further contagion. These results highlight the importance of preparedness by the private and official sector for cyberattacks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aggregate U.S. bank lending to firms expanded following the outbreak of COVID‐19. Using loan‐level supervisory data, we show that this expansion was driven by draws on credit lines by large firms. Banks that experienced larger credit line drawdowns restricted term lending more, crowding out credit to smaller firms, which reacted by reducing investment. A structural model calibrated to match our empirical results shows that while credit lines increase total bank credit in bad times, they redistribute credit from firms with high propensities to invest to firms with low propensities to invest, exacerbating the decrease in aggregate investment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do movements in the distributions of bank size and income affect the macroeconomy? To answer this question, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous financial intermediaries, incomplete markets, and aggregate uncertainty. We find that market incompleteness and uninsured idiosyncratic bank rate of return risk generate minimal concentration in the bank net worth distribution, leading to an “as-if” result, whereby the economy behaves as if it had a representative bank. However, introducing ex ante heterogeneity in the banks’ rates of return significantly raises concentration and amplifies real and financial fluctuations relative to the representative-bank case, as this increases a key sufficient statistic, the average marginal propensity to lend. We then extend the model with two empirically validated features of the banking sector—countercyclical return risk and deposit market power—and show that these amplify and dampen aggregate fluctuations, respectively. Finally, because in the model with ex ante heterogeneity the distribution of bank size is highly concentrated, shocks to the largest banks can account for almost all of the aggregate variation that is due to idiosyncratic risk, leading to granular banking and economic cycles. The failure of granular banks (“too big to fail”) produces sizeable macroeconomic crises.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Bunker Refueling Under Price Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bunker refueling decisions in international shipping are crucial operational choices. Each ship acts like a movable storage unit navigating through diverse markets, procuring bunker fuels from different ports to sustain its voyage. This involves grappling with challenges posed by varying bunker fuel prices over time and locations. To address this, we propose data-drivenstructure-prescriptive (SP) approachesthat combine the strengths of modern machine learning with the insights from traditional OR modeling and optimization. Instead of predicting future fuel prices, our approach directly learns the optimal policy from data and adapts refueling decisions to the current market conditions, including fuel prices, crude oil price, NYSE index, etc.Our focus lies in leveraging the well-established understanding that the optimal refueling decision adheres to a state-dependent base-stock refueling policy. This decision depends on factors such as the port of call, fuel tank capacity, market conditions, and is finite-valued, depending on the ship’s schedule and voyage. We provide a practical framework to incorporate these structural properties into data-driven decision-making. The finite-valued property, for instance, establishes a connection between the refueling problem and multi-class classification, integrating OR modeling with machine learning.We test our approach through experiments under both simulated scenarios and a real-world example involving the Asia-North America Trade Route. The proposed SP approaches successfully recovered the “true” optimal refueling policy in synthetic simulations. Our real-world data experiments further demon-strate that integrating structural properties into the learning process enhances the quality of prescriptions, particularly when training data is limited. Specifically, with one and a half years of training data, the proposed methods outperform current industry practices. With less than three years of training data, our models yield substantial fuel cost savings, approximately 40 US dollars per metric ton, during the testing period.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Efficiency and Interventions of Strategic Driver Relocation for Ride-Hailing Platforms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Idle drivers’ spontaneous relocation, when provided with sufficient information, has the potential to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance in ride-hailing services. As this potential remains ambiguous, this study aims to address two fundamental questions and derive managerial insights: Q1: To what extent can drivers’ spontaneous relocation resolve the supply-demand imbalance? Q2: How can subsidies be designed to induce the platform optimum? We propose a leader-follower game-theoretic framework to investigate the dynamic relocation game on arbitrary service networks. The platform, as the leader, designs relocation subsidies to achieve service-oriented or interest-oriented goals, while idle drivers, as followers, decide relocation and compete for individual returns in a multi-stage context. Despite the inherent problem complexity, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, transformation, and solution of the driver equilibrium, providing insights into these critical questions. First, the platform should avoid issuing subsidies purely for relocation purposes when drivers’ actions align with platform goals, such as 1) when the supply and demand are sufficiently imbalanced in volume, eliminating drivers’ gambling behavior, and 2) when commission rates are low—a plausible case in practice—due to the tension between the platform and drivers. Second, we present the potential of the platform intervention in other cases, providing theoretical references for the platform expectations. Notably, due to the extra responsibility gap, the subsidy impact on completed trips exceeds that on platform profits, with the latter at most doubling. Third, we investigate the imbalance in demand that values the platform’s intervention. While a certain spatial imbalance or a demand surge in peak hours emphasizes subsidies for platform goals, the spatial and temporal imbalance can possibly complement each other, inducing coupled demand that directly achieves platform-optimal goals. These results comprehensively answer Q1 along with practical suggestions. Fourth, for Q2, we confirm its feasibility and provide actionable subsidy configurations that induce platform-optimal goals to aid platform management. Numerical examples demonstrate that sparse network structures can lead to larger realized gaps. Additionally, drivers with appropriately random behavior can enhance platform performance, suggesting careful information disclosure by platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores the effects of competition on fair trade operations. Specifically, as a benchmark, we first consider a model with a single fair trade organization (FTO), i.e., a monopoly FTO. We then extend the analysis to a setting with two competing FTOs, i.e., duopoly FTOs. Although both FTOs share the common goal of alleviating farmers’ poverty, they adopt contrasting strategies: one FTO seeks to lower the barriers to fair trade, aiming tomainstreamit, while the other maintains stricter standards to preventfairwashing(orgreenwashing). Following industry practices, we implement two modes of competition and compare them with the monopoly benchmark. We find that, while competition between FTOs increases the aggregate demand for fair trade certified products (mainstreaming), it results in less aggregate premium (fairwashing). Furthermore, we consider the potential application of blockchain technology in fair trade operations and demonstrate that it offers a promising solution to mitigate thefairwashingeffects from competition between FTOs.</content>

    <title>Conquering the Divide? The Role of Political Polarization in the Destigmatization of a U.S. Medical Marijuana Platform Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A documented recent rise in the polarization of American legislative politics underscores the question of how increasing political polarization affects organizations and industries. Yet, organizational scholars have not directed significant attention to the impact of polarization. In this paper, we demonstrate that political polarization may play an important role in organizational dynamics by revealing that polarization may expedite the destigmatization of legal yet historically stigmatized industries. To this end, we develop a theory explaining how political polarization normalizes counter-normative behavior and encourages customers to become open about their engagement with stigmatized products and organizations—a key step toward industry destigmatization. We further argue that this polarization impact may vary across regional markets because of differences in local legitimation processes that can either amplify (normative legitimacy) or attenuate (regulatory legitimacy) the effect of polarization on consumer engagement with a stigmatized industry. We find empirical evidence for our theorizing in analyses of all U.S. dispensaries of medical marijuana that existed on the online platformWeedmaps.comfrom its beginning in 2008 to 2014. Ultimately, this paper suggests that political polarization can significantly influence organizations and industries and thus warrants more systematic investigation and attention from organizational scholars, particularly in stigmatized industries.</content>

    <title>Connected to a Sinking Ship? Firm Performance in a Besieged Autocracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Doing business in an autocracy that still permits the existence of markets is fundamentally different than operating under a democracy. This variety of state capitalism, termed authoritarian capitalism, requires specific form of political connections to the regime in order to survive and, in some cases, to thrive. However, authoritarian governance has another defining feature—namely paroxysms of political violence of different modalities, a phenomenon that can harm business but may benefit those who are connected to the regime. This paper examines life under a particular authoritarian capitalist state, 19th-century tsarist Russia, via an examination of one politically connected firm, the full-service steamship firm Kavkaz i Merkurii (Caucasus and Mercury). Using never-before-utilized company archival material to examine the firm’s relationship with the tsar, I find that management directly pursued intense business linkages with the government, even appointing tsarist officials and members of the royal family to leadership positions. This behavior increased even as political violence skyrocketed throughout Russia. A formal empirical analysis shows that this strategy was mostly beneficial for the firm, as some forms of political violence were received positively by shareholders as a source of new business. However, military action that drew heavily on the firm—where the government was underpaying relative to market rates—was perceived negatively by investors, and violence, which could have threatened the regime, manifested in higher long-term volatility. This paper shows both the benefits and costs associated with political connections under authoritarian capitalism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formulate a tractable model of pricing under directed search with heterogeneous firm demands. Demand characteristics drive bids in a position auction and enable us to bridge insights from the ordered search literature to those in the position auction literature. Equilibrium pricing implies that the marginal consumer’s surplus decreases down the search order, so consumers optimally follow the firms’ position ordering. A firm suffers from “business stealing” by firms that precede it and “search appeal” from subsequent firms. We find rankings that achieve the maximal joint profit or consumer surplus by constructing firm-specific scores. A generalized second price auction for positions endogenizes equilibrium orders and bids are driven by position externalities that impact incremental profit from switching positions. The joint profit maximization order is upheld when firm heterogeneity concerns mostly their mark-up potentials. But the consumer welfare order is robust when firms differ mostly over their potential market sizes.</content>

    <title>Brokering Votes with Information Spread Via Social Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Politicians rely on political brokers to buy votes throughout much of the developing world. We investigate how social networks facilitate these vote-buying exchanges. Our conceptual framework suggests brokers should be particularly well-placed within the network to learn about non-copartisans’ reciprocity in order to target transfers effectively. As a result, parties should recruit brokers who are central among non-copartisans. We combine village network data from brokers and citizens with broker reports of vote buying, allowing us to use broker and citizen fixed effects. We show that networks diffuse information about citizens to brokers who leverage it to target transfers. In particular, among those citizens who are not registered to their party, brokers target reciprocal citizens about whom they can learn more through their network, and these citizens are more likely to support the brokers’ party. Moreover, recruited brokers are significantly more central than other citizens among non-copartisans, but not among copartisans. These results highlight the importance of information diffusion through social networks for vote buying, broker recruitment, and ultimately for political outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A seller with commitment power sets prices over time. Risk-averse buyers arrive to the market and decide when to purchase. We show that it is optimal for the seller to choose a constant high price punctuated by occasional episodes of sequential discounts that occur at random times. This optimal price path has the property that the price a buyer ends up paying is independent of his arrival and purchase times, and only depends on his valuation. Our theory accommodates empirical findings on the timing of discounts.</content>

    <title>The Power of Posting: An Examination of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; Social Media Celebrity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing prevalence of social media has prompted discussions regarding its impact on the social evaluations of organizational leaders. In this study, we develop the construct of CEO social media celebrity, which arises when a CEO obtains high levels of attention and positive emotional responses from audiences on social media. Building upon parasocial interaction theory, we examine how a CEO's posting influences their likelihood of becoming a social media celebrity. Analyzing 320 S&amp;P 1500 CEOs on X (formerly Twitter) from 2009 to 2021, who posted over 250,000 times and attracted 1.6 mentions from social media users, we find that the volume, positivity, and variety of CEO posts relate positively to CEO social media celebrity attainment, while the uniqueness of their posts shows no such effect. Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that the nature of the CEO's social media posts relates differently to the two dimensions of CEO social media celebrity (i.e., larger audience attention and positive emotional reactions). We offer suggestions for future research to further enrich the understanding of social evaluations in an increasingly digital world and provide practical insights for CEOs seeking to boost their public profile using social media.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between international trade and development in a model where countries differ in their capability, goods differ in their complexity, and capability growth is a function of a country's pattern of specialization. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for international trade to increase capability growth in all countries and, in turn, to push all countries up the development ladder. This occurs if (i) shifting employment towards more complex sectors raises capability growth and if (ii) foreign competition is tougher in less complex sectors for all countries. Empirically, we provide causal evidence consistent with (i) using the entry of countries into the World Trade Organization as an instrumental variable for other countries' patterns of specialization. The opposite of (ii), however, holds in the data. Through the lens of our model, these two empirical observations imply dynamic welfare losses from trade that are pervasive, albeit small for the median country. The same economic forces also suggest that the emergence of China has held back capability growth for a number of African countries who are pushed away from their most-complex sectors, which China exports, and into their least-complex sectors, which China imports.</content>

    <title>Litigation risk and IPO underpricing: evidence from federal judge ideology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using federal judge ideology as an exogenous measure of issuing firms’ litigation risk, we document that the initial public offerings (IPOs) of the firms headquartered in more liberal circuits are more underpriced. The effect is mitigated when plaintiffs’ pleading standards are more stringent and is amplified when judges have more discretion in their decisions. The effect is also amplified among deep pocketed issuing firms, while it is mitigated among issuing firms hiring reputable intermediaries in the IPO process. The results of additional analysis suggest that issuing firms located in more liberal circuits are more likely to become targets of lawsuits after their IPOs and that these lawsuits are less likely to be dismissed by the courts and result in larger settlements. Collectively, our findings underscore the salience of litigation risk stemming from the issuing firms’ legal environment in driving IPO underpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic led to sharp declines in public transit ridership, resulting in budget shortfalls and service cuts that disproportionately affect vulnerable riders who lack alternative transportation options. Understanding the effect of vaccination on public transportation demand is important for planning for demand recovery as vaccination efforts progress. This study examines this effect, with a particular focus on heterogeneous effects across population groups. Estimating the impact of vaccination is challenging due to a lack of fine-grained data and potential endogeneity issues. To overcome these hurdles, we exploit the distinctive features of the COVID-19 vaccination progress to identify an instrumental variable. By merging the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination data with county-level mobility data, we construct a sample that links vaccination rates to the demand for public transportation and follow the instrumental variable approach to estimate the impact. We show that higher vaccination rates led to increases in public transportation demand, as reflected in mobility data from transit stations. Furthermore, we find the effect of vaccination on public transit demand is 50% greater in counties with a larger uninsured population and 80% greater in counties with a higher share of residents without a college degree. Our findings suggest that as vaccination efforts progress, public transit agencies should proactively strengthen their infrastructure to accommodate the anticipated rise in ridership. A strategic, forward-looking approach will be critical to ensuring a sustainable and effective recovery of public transportation systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As omnichannel operations become increasingly important for meeting diverse customer expectations in retail, continuous innovation in service and business models is essential to maintain a competitive edge. While effective order fulfillment is key to omnichannel success, the manual picking process in physical stores, one of the major driver of fulfillment costs, still offers substantial opportunities for improvement. This paper focuses on thecrowdpickingmodel as an innovative approach to manage online order picking operations in physical stores by leveraging existing in-store customers, offering a business model with considerable potential. We explore the real-time assignment of orders to in-store customers using ML to identify effective assignment policies. These policies are combined with a task-decomposition strategy to reduce picking costs and enhance crowdpicker participation as a key resource. The proposed crowdpicking model and its real-time management framework are tested on real-world data. Our results show that a well-managed crowdpicking system can lower order picking costs by more than 20% and provide actionable insights for managers in designing such systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we define and develop the concept of avant-garde market driving, a process whereby producers transform an industry by rebelling against the status quo as a means of social-industrial critique rather than in response to market demand. Avant-garde market driving is primarily driven by a desire to rebel against the status quo, at the expense of widespread acceptance; it involves a multiplicity of like-minded individuals such as other producers, intermediaries and consumers; it occurs particularly in contexts where like-minded consumers seek hedonic or aesthetic novelty or social distinction. Breaking new ground comes with substantial challenges. How do rebel producers overcome the challenges of introducing radically different products and successfully sustain avant-garde market driving? Analyzing the wine market in France, we find that avant-garde market driving is initiated and sustained by symbolic disruption and vertical collaboration among producers and intermediaries. This process can provide a strategic advantage to smaller, low-status firms. Based on our analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for producers and intermediaries who wish to engage in avant-garde market driving.</content>

Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how relative performance evaluation (RPE) affects industry competition—a question relevant for corporate boards interested in incentivizing executives. Using U.S. airline data, we estimate a dynamic game of competition between heterogeneous firms in an oligopolistic market, with managers incentivized by RPE contracts. While RPE can induce a firm to compete more intensely by smoothing compensation, it also amplifies a firm’s cost efficiency relative to its peers and can weaken competition from inefficient firms. The first effect dominates in small markets and the second in median-sized markets. RPE has little effect in large, highly profitable markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have seen a rise in global trade of “green products”—those designed to minimize environmental harm compared to traditional alternatives. In this study, we examine the relevance of pollution haven effects—i.e., shifts of production toward countries with less stringent environmental standards—in firms’ global sourcing strategies for green products. Given the importance of credible and sustainable manufacturing practices in firms’ global value chains for green products, we expect that country environmental standards shape global sourcing decisions for green versus non-green products differently. Our findings using data on global imports and exports for more than 5000 distinct products over the 2002–2019 period show that green products are more likely to be sourced from countries with higher environmental stringency, whereas non-green product sourcing patterns align with prior research, which emphasizes the appeal of lower environmental standards and cost-efficiency. This green sourcing effect is stronger for consumer-facing products and for sourcing into countries where consumer engagement in environmentalism is higher and non-governmental organizations are more active. Unlike prior research that implies that higher environmental standards hurt exporters, our results suggest that such standards can benefit green product exporters.</content>

    <title>Sustainability Cues Can Delay Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rise of environmental concerns in recent decades, many companies have joined the initiative to advertise and promote sustainable consumption. The current research examines how providing sustainability cues to consumers might have unintended consequences of which practitioners and policymakers may not be fully aware. One pilot study and ten main studies, including two real-choice studies, show that a sustainability cue may delay consumption. That is, in an intertemporal choice, a sustainability cue can increase preference for a larger-later option over a smaller-sooner option. This effect occurs because a sustainability cue shifts a consumer’s temporal focus toward the future, leading to a shorter perceived wait time for the larger-later option. The findings further show that the delay does not emerge among those with strong green consumption values and can be circumvented if firms communicate the immediate need or instant payoff of sustainable actions. By investigating how sustainability cues shift consumer preferences between two options separated in time, the current research contributes to the literature on both sustainable consumption and intertemporal choice. The findings offer practitioners and policymakers guidelines to nudge consumers’ sustainable consumption more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model populism as the dissemination of a false “alternative reality,” according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism. (JEL D72, D82, D83)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that predictable uninformed cash flows forecast aggregate market stock returns. Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9. These results suggest price pressure is a widespread result of flows, not an anomaly. (JEL G12, G14, G35)</content>

    <title>Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This “offset” policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A nested bundling strategy creates menus in which more expensive bundles include all the goods of less expensive ones. We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles. (JEL D11, D21, D42, D82, M31)</content>

    <title>Moonshot: Public R&amp;amp;D and Growth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-term effect of public R&amp;D on growth in manufacturing by analyzing new data from the Cold War–era space race. We develop a novel empirical strategy that leverages US-Soviet rivalry in space technology to isolate windfall R&amp;D spending. Our results demonstrate that public R&amp;D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors. While migration responses were important, they were not sufficient to generate a wedge between local and national effects. The iconic moonshot R&amp;D program had only modest economic effects for both the local and national space-related sectors. (JEL E22, H54, L60, N12, N42, N62, O47)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Supplemental Security Income program uses a birth weight cutoff at 1,200 grams to determine eligibility. Using birth certificates linked to administrative records, we find low-income families of infants born just below the cutoff receive higher monthly cash benefits (equal to 27 percent of family income) at ages 0–2 with smaller benefits continuing through age 10. Yet we detect no improvements in health care use and mortality in infancy, nor in health and human capital outcomes as observed through young adulthood for these infants. We also find no improvements for their older siblings. (JEL I12, I13, I18, I38, J13, J14, J31)</content>

    <title>Drivers of Change: Employment Responses to the Lifting of the Saudi Female Driving Ban</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment to quantify the impact of the lifting of the Saudi women's driving ban on women's employment by randomizing rationed spaces in driver's training. Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women. The results underscore the importance of intrahousehold responses that can counteract legal gains in women's freedoms. (JEL C93, D13, J16, J22, K38, O15, O17)</content>

    <title>Test-Optional Admissions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many US colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that “society” dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its “disagreement cost.” We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.

    <title>Labor Market Power, Self-Employment, and Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.

    <title>Micro versus Macro Labor Supply Elasticities: The Role of Dynamic Returns to Effort</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2. (JEL D31, H24, H31, J22, J31, J62)</content>

    <title>Imperfect Competition and Rents in Labor and Product Markets: The Case of the Construction Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).
