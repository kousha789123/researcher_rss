    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal and Self Selection of Service Type in a Queueing System where Long Service Postpones the Need for the Next Service</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a make-to-order system with a finite set of customers. Production is stochastic with a nonlinear dependence between the ordered quantity and the production rate. Customers may have to queue until their turn arrives, and therefore their order decisions interact. Specifically, while being served, customers are aware of the queue length and choose one of two order quantities (or service types). The time to the next replenishment (their activity time) is stochastic and depends on the order quantities. A customer is inactive during service and while waiting in the queue. We refer to the type of service with a greater ratio of expected activity to service time as “more efficient”. In the centralized case, the system is interested in maximizing the steady-state average number of active customers, which is referred to as the efficiency of the system. We show that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal, but the optimal strategy can be approximated well by selecting one of three threshold strategies which depend on the number of inactive customers. In the decentralized case, each customer acts to maximize the fraction of time she is active. We observe that individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: When the queue is long, individuals tend to choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short service in this case. This makes the system difficult to regulate. However, we show that simply removing the less efficient service significantly increases efficiency.</content>

    <title>Replenishment Recommendation in Convenience Stores</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of a replenishment recommendation system on inventory management in convenience stores. We collaborate with a convenience store chain to implement the system in some locations while leaving others unchanged. We find that the introduction of the system increases reorder points and reduces order size, leading to a 2.9% improvement in service levels without requiring additional inventory and without negatively affecting sales or revenue. Additionally, it reduces managers’ daily ordering time by 36.5%, thus enhancing overall store efficiency. Our study also highlights the important role of managerial discretion in complementing the system. For popular items, managers often adjust recommendations by placing orders ahead of any recommendations or increasing the recommended quantity. Interview with managers suggests that they override in anticipation of demand increases that the system has yet to detect. For non-popular items, given their slow-moving nature, managers are more likely to postpone recommendations due to concerns over excess inventory. Our study demonstrates that, for small retailers without the resources to invest in advanced algorithms, even a basic moving average algorithm can be effective by allowing managerial discretion to complement the algorithm in responding to demand fluctuations. This also underscores the need to enhance recommendation accuracy for both top-selling items, given their significant contribution to sales, and the typically overlooked less-popular items due to their slow-moving nature.</content>

    <title>On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice Modeling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice ModelingChoice modeling is an important topic that underlies a wide range of applications involving human decision making, and it traces its roots to the 1920s. Matrix balancing has an equally long history and wide applicability (e.g., in transportation and mobility networks). Recently, its celebrated Sinkhorn’s algorithm has been instrumental in the efficient approximation of optimal transport distances. However, the two topics have largely developed independently. In “On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice Modeling,” Qu, Galichon, Gao, and Ugander establish extensive connections between a class of Luce choice models and a common matrix-balancing problem. They leverage these connections to resolve open problems on the convergence of Sinkhorn’s algorithm for nonnegative matrices, characterizing its global linear convergence rate in terms of the algebraic connectivity and deriving the sharp asymptotic rate. The connections established in this paper between two seemingly unrelated topics help the transmission of ideas and lead to further interesting results.</content>

    <title>Politicians’ Ideology, State Intervention, and Corporate Taxation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines whether and how politicians’ ideologies influence corporate taxation. Our tests exploit the implementation of the 1978 Reform and Opening-up policy in China that significantly weakens the communist ideology. Using textual analyses of city secretaries’ speeches, we first establish that secretaries who joined the communist party after 1978 have a weaker communist ideology. We next show that, in the postreform period, firms in cities whose secretaries joined the communist party after 1978 have significantly lower effective tax rates than those of firms with secretaries joining the communist party beforehand. Further analyses reveal that tax benefit provisions and tax enforcement are the mechanisms through which secretaries’ ideologies influence corporate taxation.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [General Research Fund 17502219].

    <title>When Rivalry Backfires: How Individual Skill and Risk of Status Loss Moderate the Effects of Rivalry on Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing rivalry research finds that people try harder and perform better when competing against their rivals. However, are there conditions under which rivalry can harm performance? We integrate rivalry theory with regulatory fit theory to propose two moderators of rivalry: individual skill and situational risk for status change. We test our predictions using data from software programming contests involving more than 4.6 million competitive encounters across 16,846 software developers (“coders”) to examine the causal effects of rivalry and the conditions under which it may backfire. We find that, on average, coders who are randomly assigned to compete against a field of competitors with whom they share a rivalrous history exhibit higher performance, above and beyond other established drivers of performance in competition. Importantly, however, this positive effect of rivalry is moderated by (1) coders’ skill level, such that rivalry is more beneficial for more skilled coders and is harmful for less skilled coders, and (2) coders’ risk of experiencing a status change, such that coders who face a possible status loss exhibit decreased performance when competing against rivals. Thus, we extend research on rivalry by revealing the conditions under which it can harm performance, which is vital to understanding its role in organizations.This paper was accepted by Sameer Srivastava, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00344 .</content>

    <title>Does Speculation in Futures Markets Improve Commodity Hedging Decisions?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of traditional versus selective hedging strategies in commodity futures markets. Traditional hedging aims solely to reduce spot price risk, whereas selective hedging also seeks to enhance returns by predicting movements in commodity futures prices. We construct selective hedges using a range of forecasting techniques, from simple historical averages to advanced machine learning models, and evaluate their performance based on the expected mean-variance utility of hedge portfolio returns. Out-of-sample results for 24 commodities do not favor selective hedging over traditional hedging as the former increases risk without delivering additional returns. These findings are robust across various hedge reformulations, expanding estimation windows, and rebalancing frequencies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This research was supported by grants from Audencia Business School and Auckland University of Technology, awarded during A.

    <title>Too Much, Too Soon, for Too Long: The Dynamics of Competitive Executive Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine executive compensation in a general equilibrium model with dynamic moral hazard, where executives' outside options are endogenously determined by equilibrium market compensation. Firms provide incentives through compensation packages featuring deferred payments as “carrots” and termination as “sticks.” Crucially, the effectiveness of termination as an incentive device is undermined by the outside options available to executives. As individual firms fail to internalize the effect of their compensation design on these endogenous outside options, the equilibrium is generally inefficient. Compared to shareholder‐value‐maximizing compensation packages, executives are paid too much, too soon, and keep their jobs for too long.</content>

    <title>Near-Histories and Strategy Emergence: A Microhistorical Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even when anticipated strategic decisions or actions do not materialize, they can still set in motion emergent dynamics with collateral consequences that lead to profound strategic consequences. Adopting a microhistorical lens, we elucidate the dynamics of these processes by focusing on two largely dismissed near-history episodes in the relatively recent history of the Nokia Corporation. We develop a process model that elaborates on how anticipatory reactions, mobilization of networks, revision of expectations, and the emergence of a new strategic direction can eventually have significant strategic consequences. By focusing on this poorly understood but important form of strategy emergence, we contribute to a fuller understanding of strategy emergence and the role of strategic agency therein. Furthermore, we extend the conversation on near-histories from focusing on what could have happened to examining their concrete consequences. Our findings show that near-history episodes are not merely precursors or impediments to actualized events but productive forces shaping organizational trajectories in ways that realized events alone cannot explain. In so doing, our microhistorical analysis has major methodological implications for historically oriented strategy research and for our understanding of causal complexity in strategy emergence.</content>

    <title>Estimating Welfare Effects in a Nonparametric Choice Model: The Case of School Vouchers</title>
    <updated>2025-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop new robust discrete choice tools to learn about the average willingness to pay for a price subsidy and its effects on demand given exogenous, discrete variation in prices. Our starting point is a nonparametric, nonseparable model of choice. We exploit the insight that our welfare parameters in this model can be expressed as functions of demand for the different alternatives. However, while the variation in the data reveals the value of demand at the observed prices, the parameters generally depend on its values beyond these prices. We show how to sharply characterize what we can learn when demand is specified to be entirely nonparametric or to be parameterized in a flexible manner, both of which imply that the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We use our tools to analyze the welfare effects of price subsidies provided by school vouchers in the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. We find that the provision of the status quo voucher and a wide range of counterfactual vouchers of different amounts can have positive and potentially large benefits net of costs. The positive effect can be explained by the popularity of low-tuition schools in the program; removing them from the program can result in a negative net benefit. We also find that various standard logit specifications, in comparison, limit attention to demand functions with low demand for the voucher, which do not capture the large magnitudes of benefits credibly consistent with the data.</content>

    <title>Reallocative Auctions and Core Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When selling goods like wireless spectrum or electricity contracts, designers often opt for core-selecting mechanisms—i.e., those that induce outcomes in the core—in order to balance revenue and efficiency goals. But increasingly, auctions—such as the FCC's Incentive Auction and those explored for natural resources—seek to reallocate goods, not just sell them. We show that when bidders can both buy and sell, substitutability among goods is no longer sufficient or necessary for core selection. In particular, in these environments, core selection can fail even with a single good and positive revenue, and can succeed even when some or all bidders view goods as complements. Instead, we show that the key feature that determines core selection is heterogeneity among the bidders. With too much heterogeneity, reallocation mostly realizes pre-existing gains from trade among the bidders, and core selection fails. With limited heterogeneity, most gains from trade among the bidders are created by the quantity auctioned, and a core-selecting mechanism is possible.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Hidden Fees to Open Books: An Empirical Examination of the Impact of Hospital Price Transparency Rule on Costs and Quality of Medical Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, the lack of competition within the healthcare market is notably influenced by the opacity of service pricing, leading to unchecked price increases without improvements in service quality. The hospital price transparency rule, implemented on January 1, 2021, seeks to address this by requiring the disclosure of prices, aiming to stimulate competition and lower costs. Yet, the policy’s effect on hospital charges and consumer behavior remains largely unexplored. This study employs a difference-in-differences analysis of inpatient data from Florida hospitals to assess the impact of the Federal price transparency rule on hospital charges and patient decision-making, leveraging the phased compliance of hospitals with the rule.Our analysis reveals that while the price transparency rule does not broadly reduce hospital charges, it leads to lower charges for self-pay patients opting for elective procedures who are sensitive to price and can shop for better deals. This reduction is driven by both lower unit prices and decreased care complexity as hospitals compete to attract cost-conscious patients. Furthermore, our findings indicate that after the implementation of the policy, patients choose hospitals that not only comply with the rule but also charge below the market average, particularly benefiting those seeking elective services. This suggests that price transparency primarily aids cost-aware patients with the flexibility to choose more affordable providers. Our research underscores the nuanced impact of price transparency on healthcare costs and patient welfare, offering valuable insights for future healthcare policy development.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: On Matching Efficiency in Online Labor Markets for IT Services: The Role of Project Description</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many online labor markets face challenges in matching service providers with employers because of the high uncertainty in online environments compared to traditional ones. While prior studies have mostly focused on the uncertainty that employers face with service providers, our study explores the uncertainty service providers face when selecting projects on which to bid. Specifically, our study examines the role of project description in the Call for Bids (CFB) that describes the services requested by employers, in shaping service providers’ bidding behavior and the matching between service providers and employers. Drawing upon transaction cost economics, we examine three key dimensions of project descriptions: (a)codifiability(provisions of detailed procedures), (b)flexibility(provisions of renegotiation opportunities), and (c) provisions ofoutcome standards. We first use machine learning to quantify the three key dimensions based on unstructured textual information. Second, we use Bayesian mediation analysis and a randomized experiment to examine the role of these three key dimensions in matching efficiency and to explore the mediating role of three key bid attributes (i.e., number of bids, average price of bids, average quality of bids). Findings reveal:First, codifiability is positively associated with matching efficiency by reducing the number of bids received by employers.Second, flexibility is negatively associated with matching efficiency by raising the average price of bids.Third, outcome standards are positively linked to matching efficiency by reducing the number, albeit improving the average quality, of bids. By focusing on the project description and analyzing the textual content of CFB, our study contributes to the literature by enhancing the matching efficiency of online labor markets and facilitating the contracting of IT services in online labor markets.</content>

    <title>A Ridesharing Platform with an Oversupply of Drivers: Different Assigning Rates or Commission Rates for Drivers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a ridesharing platform's choice among two quality-dependent compensation schemes for drivers when the market is oversupplied, that is, there are more drivers than riders at a given time. We examine an information asymmetric context in which drivers (high and low cost) have different costs to improve service quality, which is private information. The platform designs a menu of contracts for drivers to reveal their type. In the assigning-differentiation compensation scheme, the platform offers contract options with different assigning rates, that is, the probability of receiving an order assignment, different service-quality levels, but the same commission rate. In the commission-differentiation compensation scheme, the platform offers contract options with different commission rates, different service-quality levels, but the same assigning rate. We find that the oversupply degree, measured as the ratio of the number of drivers to the number of riders, plays a critical role in the platform's choice of scheme. The platform's expected profit is higher under the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when the oversupply degree is high (low). We also determine the effect of the driver-type distribution on the platform's choice of scheme. When the difference in the drivers’ costs is small, the platform is more likely to choose the commission-differentiation scheme when there are more high-cost drivers. When the cost difference is large, first, the platform is more (less) likely to choose the commission-differentiation (assigning-differentiation) scheme, but then, it is more (less) likely to choose the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when there are more high-cost drivers. Further, high-cost drivers are indifferent to either compensation scheme, whereas low-cost drivers are better off under the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when the oversupply degree is low (high). In addition, we find that both the platform and (low-cost) drivers prefer the assigning-differentiation scheme, a win-win outcome under certain conditions. Finally, we show that the platform can provide a subsidy to mitigate potential misalignment with the drivers.</content>

    <title>Not Good Enough, but Try Again! The Impact of Improved Rejection Communications on Contributor Retention and Performance in Open Knowledge Collaboration</title>
    <updated>2025-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Producing high-quality content through open knowledge collaboration presents a dilemma. Successful quality control requires rejecting contributions that do not align with the aims of an open knowledge collaboration system, yet rejections demotivate new contributors from attempting further contributions. Building on research on the regulation of behavior in online communities and on organizational selection, we theorize how the way rejections are communicated affect new contributors. We leverage a change to the rejection notices used by the Stack Overflow community question-answering service to study the issue empirically. First, we use a regression discontinuity in time design to construct a natural experiment to estimate the average treatment effect of more informative rejection notices on the retention of initially rejected contributors. The results show that notices that better explain the reason for rejecting a contributor’s initial question—and therefore reduce uncertainty about the outcome if the contributor tries again—increase retention by approximately 21.7 percentage points. Second, we use a mediation model to study mechanisms by which more informative rejection notices affect contributor performance. We find that more informative notices affect contributor performance through selection rather than performance improvement. Additional contributors, who are retained because of the more informative rejection notices, ask more questions, on average, whereas we find no evidence of individual contributors improving their performance in terms of the quality or quantity of their contributions. Overall, the results suggest that rejection communications offer low-cost interventions to mitigate the trade-off between new contributor retention and the quality of contributions in open knowledge collaboration.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the Fox School of Business, Temple University (Young Scholar Interdisciplinary Forum) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02720 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In their early life-cycle stages, business-to-business (B2B) high-tech start-ups face severe challenges in establishing their first customer relationships. To generate business growth, they must convey the value of unfamiliar, innovative, complex offerings to customers, using the limited resources at their disposal. Prior research has not examined the different roles of mass-media marketing and personal sales communications in this challenging endeavor, despite principal differences between these activities in start-up contexts. To help B2B high-tech start-ups allocate financial resources to mass-media marketing and personal sales communications across early and later stages of their organizational life cycle, this article presents a longitudinal survey study involving founders of B2B high-tech start-ups. The findings indicate that start-ups spending a larger share of their budget on personal sales (i.e., higher personal sales expense ratio) exhibit stronger performance in earlier stages of their life cycle but weaker performance in later stages; however, still in later stages, these expenditures enhance certain performance metrics. Conversely, start-ups spending a larger share of their budget on mass-media marketing (i.e., higher mass-media marketing expense ratio) show stronger performance in later stages but weaker performance in earlier stages. High-tech start-ups can leverage these findings to improve their budget allocation and ensure persistent growth.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Customer Data Privacy Stewardship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To address rising customer concerns about data privacy, some firms adopt strong privacy practices. However, such investments are costly, both financially and in terms of limiting the ability to leverage customer data, leading many firms to treat privacy primarily as a risk to be managed. The current research proposes a different perspective, in which data privacy is a strategic opportunity. Specifically, this article introduces the concept ofcustomer data privacy stewardship: a customer-facing, strategic approach to responsible data privacy management. With three multimethod studies, the authors establish a positive relationship of privacy stewardship with performance at firm, brand, and customer levels. Critically, the strength of this beneficial relationship depends on customers’ perceptions of firms’ motives, such that data dependence weakens the relationship, but brand affinity strengthens it. The relationship also varies with perceptions of data risk; a history of data breaches strengthens the relationship, and strong industry-level protections weaken it. Customers’ perceptions of privacy benevolence and privacy concerns mediate the positive relationship between privacy stewardship and performance too. By moving beyond risk mitigation to emphasize strategic value creation, this conceptualization advances privacy research and offers actionable guidance for aligning privacy stewardship with public perceptions of firm motives and data risk.</content>

    <title>A Review of Market Categorization Research: An Evolutionary Framework Across Perspectives and Stages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market categorization—the process of grouping organizations perceived as sharing core attributes and serving similar demand profiles—has become a central topic in management research, offering a theoretically rich and interdisciplinary domain of study. Scholars have examined how market categories form, develop, and decline, drawing from structural, strategic, and constructionist perspectives to explore their role in shaping firms, industries, and institutions. Despite substantial advancements, research on market categorization remains fragmented, leading to inconsistent conceptualizations, theoretical isolation, and a lack of cross-stage integration. Studies often focus on individual stages while neglecting their interconnections or apply discipline-specific lenses that limit theoretical synthesis and hinder the accumulation of knowledge. To address these gaps, we conducted a systematic review of 195 articles published between 1999 and 2024, synthesizing insights across stages and perspectives to develop an evolutionary framework of market categorization. Our analysis identifies three cross-perspective mechanisms—categories as constraints, enablers, and actor-shaped entities—that underpin categorization processes and explain their underlying dynamics. In addition, by conceptualizing transitions between categorization stages, we provide a unified foundation for future research. This evolutionary perspective clarifies the role of market categorization in shaping economic and organizational landscapes while bridging theoretical divides and guiding future empirical inquiry.</content>

    <title>Leader Anthropomorphizing Behavior Toward Robots: Conceptualization, Measurement, and Implications for Perceived Objectification and Workplace Deviance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As robots become more integrated into the workplace, leaders are increasingly engaging in behaviors that anthropomorphize robots. Given that this form of leader behavior remains undertheorized, we conceptualize it as leader anthropomorphizing behavior toward robots (LABR)—an observable behavior through which leaders endow robots with human-like characteristics. Although practical wisdom and previous studies have highlighted a prevailing optimism about adopting LABR to manage human–robot teams, such optimism may be premature. Drawing on objectification theory, we develop a model that uncovers the detrimental effects of LABR on employees who observe such behavior. To test our model, we developed and validated a LABR scale (Study 1) and conducted five subsequent studies (Studies 2a–5) using vignette-based experiments and field surveys. The results showed that employees who observed LABR were more likely to perceive themselves as being objectified by their leaders, which in turn increased their likelihood of engaging in workplace deviance. By theorizing LABR and revealing its potential dark sides, we contribute to the literature on leader behavior, robot anthropomorphism, human–robot teams, and objectification.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing the performance of intralogistics operations, that is logistics operations within facilities such as manufacturing plants, order fulfillment warehouses, ports and terminals, and retail stores, is critical in fulfilling customer expectations. Traditional decision-making for intralogistics operations is based on historical data, typically collected over long-range intervals with significant processing delays. However, nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) applications are used to gather detailed real-time data to make dynamic decisions. These new data sources provide challenges and opportunities for operations management. We provide an overview of prominent IoT technologies in four domains: Manufacturing, warehousing, ports and terminals, retail, and other emerging areas. We discuss four prominent research questions (cutting across multiple application domains) that can be addressed using new data sources, along with the methodological approach and managerial insights that may result. In particular, IoT can improve the tracking and tracing of objects, equipment, and humans and provide rapid alerts, allowing managers to make real-time decisions and improve asset use, uptime, and profitability.</content>

    <title>Playing Divide-and-Choose Given Uncertain Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the classic divide-and-choose method for equitably allocating divisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian agents. The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions of those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent values and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a common-value component). We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game and identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute equilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the distribution over the chooser’s value for each good follows a normal distribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of uniform distributions over intervals. A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates several striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the divider has a compelling “diversification” incentive in creating the chooser’s two options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider’s optimal strategy when preferences are known. In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of the divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players’ levels of knowledge about each other’s values, the correlations between the players’ values, and the number of goods being divided. Under fairly mild assumptions, we show that the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, whereas the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, Harvard University, and the National Science Foundation [Grant DGE1745303].

    <title>Director Liability Protection and the Quality of Independent Directors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether legal liability protection helps companies to recruit and retain high-quality independent directors. We conduct difference-in-differences analyses exploiting the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling on the Silicon Graphics case, which substantially raised the bar for filing securities class action (SCA) lawsuits as a shock. We document supporting evidence for the talent attraction hypothesis by showing improvements in newly recruited independent director quality following the ruling, but only for candidates who are previously not exposed to SCA litigation risk. The effects are stronger for firms facing greater litigation risk ex ante or smaller local supplies of director candidates. Results are more evident for experience-based quality dimensions. We also analyze a sample of voluntary independent director departures and find little support for the talent retention hypothesis, suggesting that more complex factors enter into a director’s continuation decision once a director is already exposed to SCA litigation risk. A policy implication is that liability protection can be useful in attracting more unexposed high-quality candidates to the pool of public boards but does little to attract high-quality candidates who are already in the pool of public firms.This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.Funding: H.

    <title>How to Staff When Customers Arrive in Batches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many different settings, requests for service can arrive in near or true simultaneity with one another. This creates batches of arrivals to the underlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for the batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a dangerous and deceptive stress on services, requiring a high amount of resources and exhibiting a fundamentally larger tail in those demands. This uncovers a service regime in which a system with large batch arrivals may have low utilization but will still have nontrivial waiting. Methodologically, these staffing results follow from novel large batch and large batch-and-rate limits of the multiserver queueing model. In the large batch limit, we establish the first formal connection between general multiserver queues and storage processes, another family of stochastic models. By consequence, we show that the batch scaled queue length process is not asymptotically normal and that, in fact, the fluid- and diffusion-type limits coincide. Hence, the (safety) staffing of this system must be directly proportional to the batch size just to achieve a nondegenerate probability of wait. In exhibition of the existence and insights of this large batch regime, we apply our results to data on Covid-19 contact tracing in New York City. In doing so, we identify significant benefits produced by the tracing agency’s decision to staff above national recommendations, and we also demonstrate that there may have been an opportunity to further improve the operation by optimizing the arrival pattern in the public health data pipeline.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: We acknowledge the generous support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) through Andrew Daw’s Graduate Research Fellowship under grant DGE-1650441, received during the initial phase of this research as part of his doctoral studies at Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03979 .</content>

    <title>Data-Driven Reliable Facility Location Design</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the reliable (uncapacitated) facility location (RFL) problem in a data-driven environment where historical observations of random demands and disruptions are available. Owing to the combinatorial optimization nature of the RFL problem and the mixed-binary randomness of parameters therein, the state-of-the-art RFL models applied to the data-driven setting either suggest overly conservative solutions or become computationally prohibitive for large- or even moderate-size problems. In this paper, we address the RFL problem by presenting an innovative prescriptive model aiming to balance solution conservatism with computational efficiency. In particular, our model selects facility locations to minimize the fixed costs plus the expected operating costs approximated by a tractable data-driven estimator, which equals to a probabilistic upper bound on the intractable Kolmogorov distributionally robust optimization estimator. The solution of our model is obtained by solving a mixed-integer linear program that does not scale in the training data size. Our approach is proved to be asymptotically optimal, and offers a theoretical guarantee for its out-of-sample performance in situations with limited data. In addition, we discuss the adaptation of our approach when facing data with covariate information. Numerical results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms several important RFL models with respect to both in-sample and out-of-sample performances as well as computational efficiency.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: H.

    <title>Does Increasing the Riskiness of Choices Widen Gender Gaps?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We isolate the causal effect of changing the riskiness of choices on the gender gap in real world outcomes. We do so by exploiting a national reform to the regrade system of Norwegian universities that generated exogenous variation in the probabilities of the outcome of regrade requests. Using unique individual-level administrative data, we show that both the expected value of a regrade request, as well as the downside risk, increased substantially as a result of the policy. We then show how the ostensibly gender-neutral policy substantially increased gaps between men and women because they differed in their risk preferences and beliefs. Specifically, the exogenous change in the riskiness of requesting a regrade augmented the gender gap in regrade requests by 90%. We demonstrate that this has important implications for students through its impact on their grades. We disentangle the relative importance of mechanisms through auxiliary reduced-form analyses, structural estimation, and a supplemental laboratory experiment. Taken together, our mechanism analyses suggest that gender differences in risk preferences and loss aversion are not sufficient to explain the increased gender gap after the policy change, and that gender differences in confidence or beliefs are necessary to rationalize the data and more broadly consistent with the patterns we observe.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This project was partially funded by the Research Council of Norway through its Centers of Excellence Scheme [FAIR Project 262675].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04088 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prominent factor models are based on tradable factors that do not represent theoretically relevant risks. To address this issue, we develop a factor model that captures the risks to long-term investors present in the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). Empirically, we construct intertemporal risk factors as long-short portfolios based on stock exposures to dividend yield and realized variance. These tradable factors mimic news to long-term expected returns and volatility, and they offset part of the marginal utility increase in recessions induced by wealth declines. Our intertemporal factor model estimation implies significant risk prices that are consistent with the ICAPM restrictions under moderate risk aversion. Moreover, our model performs well relative to previous factor models in terms of its tangency Sharpe ratio and its pricing of key test assets, including single stocks, industry portfolios, and portfolios sorted on risk exposures and lagged anomalies.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00261 .</content>

    <title>The Economics of Capital Allocation in Firms: Evidence from Internal Capital Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a unique chief financial officer (CFO) survey data set to examine capital allocation in firms. Top management is aware of agency and information problems at the divisional level and organizes the budgeting process to counteract managerial opportunism, employing systems of interconnected measures, including layers of approval, divisional budgets, reporting requirements, and compensation schemes. When making funding decisions, top management relies heavily on top-level nonfinancial information, such as the assessment of divisional managers’ abilities. However, substantial parts of the capital budget do not require top management approval as firms trade off the benefits and costs of decentralization, thereby deviating from the traditional paradigm of decentralized project initiation but centralized project approval. Even firms with active internal capital markets tilt capital allocation toward relatively even distributions, reflecting the use of capital allocation as a credible communication device. We also find that within-firm agency problems may result in capital rationing, that is, divisions’ restricted access to internal capital. CFOs also believe that integrating multiple businesses into an internal capital market results in tangible financial benefits, predominantly lower costs of capital and higher debt capacities. Thus, our findings also support coinsurance arguments suggesting that internal capital markets may improve access to external financing.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the BBBank Karlsruhe, Wissenschaftsförderung der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, and Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists).

    <title>The Good, the Bad and the Picky: Consumer Heterogeneity and the Reversal of Product Ratings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of consumer heterogeneity on online ratings. Consumers differ in their experience, which can affect both their choices and ratings. Thus, biases in average ratings can arise when the opinions of experienced and novice users are aggregated. We first build a two-period model to characterize the biases’ drivers and consequences. We test our theory combining data from IMDb and MovieLens, two well-known movie ratings platforms. We proxy users’ experience with the total number of ratings posted on the platforms. First, using external measures of quality, such as the Academy awards and nominations, we show that, on both platforms, experienced users, on average, rate movies of higher quality compared with novices. Moreover, they post more stringent ratings than novices for more than 98% of movies. Combined, these imply a compression in aggregate ratings, and thus a bias against high quality movies. We then propose a simple, fixed-point algorithm to debias ratings. Our debiased ratings demonstrate the presence of ranking reversals for more than 8% of comparisons in our sample. As a result, our debiased ratings better correlate with external measures of quality.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03281 .</content>

    <title>The Value of Information Design in Supply Chain Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies an information design problem of a retailer in a two-tier supply chain that procures a single type of product from a supplier. The supplier needs to decide on a production quantity by balancing the shortage cost and the excess inventory holding cost with respect to the retailer’s demand. The retailer’s demand is random, but the retailer receives an informative signal about the demand before the supplier sets the production quantity and places orders after learning the demand realization. The retailer wants to reduce the shortage cost, and to this end, the retailer can disclose information about the retailer’s signal to persuade the supplier to increase production levels. For this setup, we characterize the optimal information disclosure policy of the retailer and shed light on settings in which the retailer strictly benefits from carefully designed information disclosure policies relative to a full- or a no-disclosure policy.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has primarily focused on the direct value of information technology (IT) and IT adoption by individuals and firms, this study explores the indirect value of IT in the form of public infrastructure technology. By exploiting a spatial discontinuity in water monitoring stations, we discover that firms located immediately upstream of water monitoring stations exhibit significantly lower levels of corruption than firms located immediately downstream. These findings are particularly noteworthy given that water monitoring stations have the potential to generate significant indirect value as they are not explicitly designed to mitigate corruption. Further analyses reveal that public infrastructure technology alone does not hold the key to mitigating corporate corruption. Instead, it is the synergistic interplay between public infrastructure technology and organizational change that drives the outcome. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the broader IT value landscape, emphasizing the indirect value of technological advancements in public infrastructure that were not originally intended for such benefit. Additionally, our findings highlight the benefits of leveraging existing infrastructure technology to address emerging societal needs.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that a broad set of asset pricing factors/anomalies are significantly exposed to “noise trader risk,” and the noise trader risk is priced in factor premia. We first confirm that mutual funds’ flow-induced trading of factors are uninformed, as they generate a large price impact on factor returns, followed by a complete reversal. We then show that asset pricing factors are subject to flow-driven noise trader risk in that expected variation (covariation) of flow-induced noise trading strongly forecasts variance (covariance) of factor returns. Importantly, factor premia are higher when flow-driven noise trader risk is expected to be more salient.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01827 .</content>

    <title>Calling All Issuers: The Market for Debt Monitoring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ninety-five percent of long-term municipal bonds have callable features, and yet, we find new evidence of a substantial fraction of local governments exercising these valuable options suboptimally, with significant delays—resulting in sizable losses. Using data from 2001 to 2019, we estimate that U.S. municipals lost over $26 billion from delayed refinancing, whereas the entire U.S. corporate sector, facing the same low interest-rate environment, lost only a comparatively modest $1.4 billion. We present evidence that these delays are related to gaps in localized debt monitoring. For instance, when a bond becomes callable in a month that is the fiscal year end of a local government—a particularly busy time for finance departments—the decision to call is delayed significantly longer. A significantly longer delay also occurs when a municipality is faced with waves of calls all coming due at once. These effects are magnified in smaller municipalities staffed with smaller finance departments. Moreover, the market for outside monitoring (e.g., underwriters) is a fractured one. It is characterized by extreme stickiness; 87% of a municipality’s bonds are issued with the same underwriter over our sample period. The usage of a less locally focused underwriter is associated with significantly greater delays.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00444 .</content>

    <title>A Model of Shoppertainment Live Streaming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Shoppertainment” live streaming, a blend of entertainment and product selling, is becoming increasingly popular. In shoppertainment sessions, streamers face bandwidth constraints so balance between providing product information and entertainment (such as singing, dancing, and storytelling). We conceptualize a shoppertainment live streamer as a novel type of online retail platform that maximizes total commissions from selling a range of manufacturer products. Our study investigates how streamers can leverage entertainment bandwidth as a long-term strategy to influence manufacturers’ pricing decisions and consumers’ attendance, as well as purchasing behaviors. Our model reveals several intriguing findings. First, we find that higher entertainment bandwidth encourages more manufacturers to adopt a demand-oriented, low-pricing strategy to attract buyers rather than a margin-oriented, high-pricing strategy that appeals only to buyers who perceive a high likelihood of finding a suitable product. Second, we observe that an increase in entertainment bandwidth initially boosts consumer traffic to shoppertainment sessions, but this trend may reverse once the bandwidth becomes excessively high, indicating an inverted U-shaped relationship. Conversely, the streamer’s expected profit per attending consumer first decreases and then increases with higher entertainment bandwidth, forming a U-shaped relationship. Third, our results suggest that a commission-maximizing streamer facing bandwidth constraints should not exclusively focus on providing product information. Instead, it is advantageous to allocate significant bandwidth to entertainment, even with limited entertaining capability, and potentially beneficial to dedicate all bandwidth to entertainment if the capability is substantial. Lastly, we demonstrate that the streamer’s quality threshold moderates the impact of entertainment bandwidth on these dynamics.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01724 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of news media consolidation on local business coverage and its consequences for firms, investors, and capital markets. Using television transcripts, we find a substantial drop in coverage of local firms following the consolidation of local television stations associated with Sinclair acquisitions. Local information search, institutional portfolio local bias, and overall retail trading decrease for firms in treated geographic areas. Results are most pronounced for small firms, for stations with higher ex ante viewership, and for stations with greater reductions in local coverage. Our results provide insight into the consequences of media consolidation for local business coverage, firms, investors, and capital markets.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Financial support from the Brigham Young University Marriott School of Business, Purdue University Mitch Daniels School of Business, and Kenan-Flagler Business School is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02247 .</content>

    <title>Staggered Health Policy Adoption: Spillover Effects and Their Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the direct and spillover effects on mobility caused by the staggered adoption of stay-at-home orders (SHOs) implemented by U.S. counties to contain COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declines by a third to a half as much as in the counties that implement the SHOs. Furthermore, these spillovers are concentrated in counties that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we also find that declines in internal mobility in the neighbor counties account for a much larger proportion of the overall decline in mobility than decreases in traffic originating in the treated counties. Together, these results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and voluntary social distancing. Based on our estimates and a simple model of staggered SHO adoption, we construct counterfactual scenarios that separate the impact of policy coordination from that of adoption timing. We find that staggered implementation of SHOs could yield mobility reductions that are larger than coordinated but delayed SHO adoption.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Hopkins Business of Health Initiative pilot grant program.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01033 .</content>

    <title>Demand-Side Effects of Open Innovation: The Case of Cryptocurrency Forking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many digital products follow an open-innovation model, wherein the open boundaries facilitate copying (forking) the codebase and creating new products, which may compete with the parents for user demand. Although a rich body of literature highlights the benefits of open source such as the availability of developers with diverse skill sets and accelerated innovation, the competition effects of forked products on the demand of their parents remain understudied. Using data from major cryptocurrencies and their forked products created between 2011 and 2021, we study how these entrants impact the demand for parent cryptocurrencies. We categorize cryptocurrencies as transaction or platform types. Transaction coins are primarily used for the exchange of goods and services, whereas platform coins offer additional capabilities such as hosting applications or third-party services. We find that parents with only transaction capabilities experience a negative impact on demand. Although popularity may shield the parents to a certain extent, the substitution effect is still dominant. However, popular coins with platform capabilities do not experience a decrease in demand when competing with forked entrants; an increase in smart contract transactions due to their compatibility with the competing forked products offsets the negative substitution effect observed for regular transactions. Our study underscores the competitive dynamics of open innovation and provides managerial insights for firms considering open models for product development. Our results highlight the importance of considering both substitution and complementarities when assessing the risks and benefits of the open-innovation model.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03132 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of adoption of labor-replacing automation technology on corporate financing. Empirically, using Chinese firm-level panel data on deployment of industrial robots as an example of such automation, we find that robot adoption increases leverage and reduces cost of debt. We hypothesize that the underlying reason is that being a substitute for labor, automation provides a hedge against fluctuations in labor costs. A model based on this hedging argument delivers additional testable predictions concerning determinants of the relation between automation and corporate financing. These relations are borne out in the data, providing support for the proposed mechanism. Our evidence is inconsistent with alternative channels behind the observed relations.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: X.

    <title>Online Learning and Decision Making Under Generalized Linear Model with High-Dimensional Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a minimax concave penalized multiarmed bandit algorithm under the generalized linear model (G-MCP-Bandit) for decision-makers facing high-dimensional data in an online learning and decision-making environment. We demonstrate that in the data-rich regime, the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm attains the optimal cumulative regret in the sample size dimension and a tight bound in the covariate dimension and the significant covariate dimension. In the data-poor regime, the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm maintains a tight regret upper bound. In addition, we develop a local linear approximation method, the two-step weighted Lasso procedure, to identify the minimax concave penalty (MCP) estimator for the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm when samples are not independent and identically distributed. Under this procedure, the MCP estimator can match the oracle estimator with high probability and converge to the true parameters at the optimal convergence rate. Finally, through experiments based on both synthetic and real data sets, we show that the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm outperforms other benchmarking algorithms in terms of cumulative regret and that the benefits of the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm increase in the data’s sparsity level and the size of the decision set.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Customer Voice on Two-Sided Platforms: The Effect of Surge Pricing on Customer Complaints</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two-sided platforms (e.g., ride-sharing, freelance labor, and lodging) match customers and service providers. Customers can voice their satisfaction level through review/rating systems, which the platforms use to monitor and screen service providers. However, customers may misdirect complaints about platform-level features toward individual service providers. We examine the extent and consequences of this issue in the context of a large ride-sharing platform. We focus on surge pricing as the platform-level feature. Our findings are as follows. First, for an average trip, surge pricing makes it 1.13 times more likely for the driver to receive a complaint (either a low rating or a formal complaint). Second, complaints negatively impact a driver’s future income. Surge-induced complaints offset about 23% of a driver’s immediate gain from the surged fare. Third, after the platform adopted a policy to cap the magnitude of surge prices, the effect of surge on customer complaints reduced. The policy also led to more usage of the platform. The results suggest a close interaction between the pricing and review systems on ride-sharing platforms. More broadly, they point to the importance for online two-sided platforms to identify and address customer complaints about platform-level features that may have been misdirected to service providers.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: Y.

    <title>Conditional Approval and Value-Based Pricing for New Health Technologies</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health technology assessments often inform decisions made by public payers, such as the UK’s National Health Service, as they negotiate the pricing of companies’ new health technologies. A common assessment mechanism compares the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the new health technology, relative to a standard of care, to a maximum threshold on the cost per quality-adjusted life year. In much research and practice, these assessments may not distinguish between cost-per-patient and negotiated price, effectively ignoring the value-based-pricing principle that better health outcomes merit higher prices. Other research makes this distinction, but it does not account for uncertainty in the ICER associated with clinical trial data that are limited in size and scope. This paper models the strategic behavior of a payer and a company as they price a new health technology, and it considers the use of conditional approval (CA) schemes whose post-marketing trials reduce ICER uncertainty before final pricing decisions are made. Analytical results suggest a very different view of the value-based pricing negotiations underlying these schemes: interim prices used during CA post-marketing trials should reflect cost-sharing for the CA scheme, not just cost-effectiveness goals for a treatment. Moreover, the types of caps on interim prices used by entities such as the UK Cancer Drugs Fund may hinder the development of new technologies and lead to suboptimal CA designs. We propose a new risk-sharing mechanism to remedy this. Numerical results, calibrated to approval data of an oncology drug, illustrate the issues in a practical setting.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: Financial support from the Mack Institute for Innovation Management at the Wharton School to the authors and the support of Dr. Simba Gill and Sabi Dau to the INSEAD Healthcare Management Initiative are gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03628 .</content>

    <title>Should Individuals Choose Their Own Incentives? Evidence from a Mindfulness Meditation Intervention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditionally, incentives to promote behavioral change are assigned rather than chosen. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically investigate the alternative approach of letting people choose their own incentives from a menu of increasingly challenging and rewarding options. When individuals are heterogeneous and have private information about their costs and benefits, we theoretically show that leaving them the choice of incentives can improve both adherence and welfare. We test the theoretical predictions in a field experiment based on daily meditation sessions. We randomly assign some participants to one of two incentive schemes and allow others to choose between the two schemes. As predicted, participants sort into schemes in (partial) agreement with the objectives of the policymaker. However, in contrast to our prediction, participants who could choose complete significantly fewer sessions than participants that were randomly assigned. Because the results are not driven by poor selection, we infer that letting people choose between incentive schemes may bring in psychological effects that discourage adherence.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Zilveren Kruis Zorgverzekeringen N.V.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04157 .</content>

    <title>Reducing Marketplace Interference Bias via Shadow Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketplace companies rely heavily on experimentation when making changes to the design or operation of their platforms. The workhorse of experimentation is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, in which users are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. However, marketplace interference causes the stable unit treatment value assumption to be violated, leading to bias in the standard RCT metric. In this work, we propose techniques for platforms to run standard RCTs and still obtain meaningful estimates despite the presence of marketplace interference. We specifically consider a generalized matching setting, in which the platform explicitly matches supply with demand via a linear programming algorithm. Our first proposal is for the platform to estimate the value of global treatment and global control via optimization. We prove that this approach is unbiased in the fluid limit. Our second proposal is to compare the average shadow price of the treatment and control groups rather than the total value accrued by each group. We prove that this technique corresponds to the correct first order approximation (in a Taylor series sense) of the value function of interest even in a finite-size system. We then use this result to prove that, under reasonable assumptions, our estimator is less biased than the RCT estimator. At the heart of our result is the idea that it is relatively easy to model interference in matching-driven marketplaces because, in such markets, the platform mediates the spillover.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01881 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the data-integrated, price-setting newsvendor problem in which the price–demand relationship is described by some parametric model with unknown parameters. We develop the operational data analytics (ODA) formulation of this problem that features a data-integration model and a validation model. The data-integration model consists of a class of functions called the operational statistics. Each operational statistic maps the available data to the ordering decision. The validation model finds, among the set of candidate operational statistics, the ordering decision that leads to the highest actual profit, which is unknown because of the unknown demand parameters. This ODA framework leads to a consistent estimate of the profit function with which we optimize the pricing decision. The derived quantity and price decisions demonstrate robust profit performance even when the sample size is very small in relation to the demand variability. Compared with the conventional approach with which the unknown parameters are estimated and then the decisions are optimized, the ODA framework produces significantly superior performance in the mean, standard deviation, and minimum of the profit, suggesting the robustness of the ODA solution especially in the small-sample regime.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02227 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a stylized incentive management problem over an infinite time horizon, where the principal hires an agent to provide services to customers. Customers request service in one of two ways: either via an online or a traditional offline channel. The principal does not observe the offline customers’ arrivals, nor does she observe whether the agent exerts (costly) effort that can increase the arrival rate of customers. This creates an opportunity for the agent (i) to divert cash (that is, to under-report the number of offline customers and pocket respective revenues) and also (ii) to shirk (that is, not to exert effort), thus leading to a novel and thus far unexplored double moral hazard problem. To address this problem, we formulate a constrained, continuous-time, stochastic optimal control problem and derive an optimal contract with a simple intuitive structure that includes a payment scheme and a potential termination time of the agent. We enrich the model to allow the principal to either (i) dynamically adjust the prices for the services in both channels or (ii) monitor the agent. Both tools help the principal to alleviate the double moral hazard problem. We derive respective optimal strategies for using those tools that guarantee the highest profits. We show that the worse the agent’s past performance is, the lower the prices should be set and the more the principal should monitor the agent.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The work of F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)’s opt-in requirement in a model with a firm that provides a digital service and consumers who are heterogeneous in their valuations of the firm’s service and the privacy costs incurred when sharing personal data with the firm. We show that the GDPR boosts demand for the service by allowing consumers with high privacy costs to buy the service without sharing data. The increased demand leads to a higher price but a smaller quantity of shared data. If the firm’s revenue is largely usage based rather than data based, then both the firm’s profit and consumer surplus increase after the GDPR, implying that the GDPR can be welfare improving. But if the firm’s revenue is largely from data monetization, then the GDPR can reduce the firm’s profit and consumer surplus.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Decision Centralization and Learning from Experience in Groups: Separating Context from Aggregation Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational learning often involves groups that learn from feedback on their decisions over time (also known as “learning by doing” or “learning from experience”). Although organizational learning is frequently assumed to resemble individual learning from experience, there is limited evidence to validate this assumption. Furthermore, groups in organizations often have centralized rather than decentralized decision making, but we know little about how they differ in learning from experience. Using a combination of experimental data and computational modeling, we compare individuals to groups that are either decentralized or centralized in their decision making. We find that centralized groups behave like hyper-individuals: They update and explore more than individuals (who, in turn, update and explore more than decentralized groups). Our evidence shows that not only do groups differ from individuals because of aggregation processes but also that individuals change their behaviors simply by virtue of being in a group (a context effect). Specifically, we find that participants assigned as leaders in centralized groups become proactive learners who seek novel information to learn by deviating from experience. Implications are drawn for how this might alter the way we conceptualize and model organizational learning.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organization.Funding: This work was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [Grant W911NF-20-1-0006], the Strategic Management Society [Will Mitchell Dissertation Research Grant Program], NUS Presidential Young Professorship grant and the Desmarais Fund for the Organizations and Algorithms project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01507 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Linkages between bank competition and risk-taking are analyzed in a model where market integration is the principal driver of increased competition. Risk implications of across-market competition under banking market integration are significantly different from that of within-market competition. Although both modes of competition increase the number of competitor banks, across-market competition yields a bank-customer effect that can potentially reverse any relation that prevails between within-market competition and risk-taking. This result suggests that the lack of consensus in the bank competition-financial stability literature is not an anomaly but an inherent feature of the analysis.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03495 .</content>

    <title>Instructions and Incentives in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a different perspective on organizations, emphasizing the role of instructions in providing incentives. In our framework, there is a conflict of interest between a principal and an agent over the course of action. When preferences are aligned over executing a course, the principal can selectively instruct the agent on a preferred course to steer the agent toward it. Because less able (less confident) agents are more responsive to instructions, hiring these types of agents can be beneficial. This steering role of instructions toward a course of action helps us understand why and when firms are reluctant to hire overqualified (high-ability) workers, how worker risk aversion can be valuable to an organization, why instructions, although more likely to be used, are less intense, in more uncertain environments, and why instruction-giving and incentive pay go hand-in-hand.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.</content>

    <title>The Click-Based MNL Model: A Framework for Modeling Click Data in Assortment Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the click-based MNL choice model, a framework for capturing customer purchasing decisions in e-commerce settings. Specifically, we augment the classical Multinomial Logit choice model by assuming that customers only consider the items they have clicked on before they proceed to compare their random utilities. In this context, we study the resulting assortment optimization problem, where the objective is to select a subset of products, made available for purchase, to maximize the expected revenue. Our main algorithmic contribution comes in the form of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem, showing that the optimal expected revenue can be efficiently approached within any degree of accuracy. To establish this result, we develop several technical ideas, including enumeration schemes and stochastic inequalities, which may be of broader interest. Using data from Alibaba’s online marketplace, we fit click-based MNL and latent class MNL models to historical sales and click data in a setting where the online platform recommends a personalized six-product display to each user. We propose an estimation methodology for the click-based MNL model that leverages clickstream data and machine learning classification algorithms. Our numerical results suggest that clickstream data are valuable for predicting choices and that the click-based MNL model can outperform standard logit-based models in certain settings.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Agricultural open burning, that is, the practice of burning crop residue in harvested fields to prepare land for sowing a new crop, is well recognized as a significant contributor to CO2and black-carbon emissions, and long-term climate change. Low-soil-tillage practices using an agricultural machine called the Happy Seeder, which can sow the new seed without removing the previous crop residue, have emerged as the most effective alternative to open burning. However, given the limited supply of Happy Seeders from the government, and the fact that farmers incur a significant yield loss if they delay sowing the new crop, farmers are often unwilling to wait to be processed by the Happy Seeder and, instead, burn their crop residue. We study how the government can use effective information-disclosure policies in the operation of Happy Seeders to minimize open burning. A Happy Seeder is assigned to process a group of farms. The government knows, but does not necessarily disclose, the Happy Seeder’s schedule at the start of the sowing season. We propose a class of information-disclosure policies, called dilatory policies, that provide no information to the farmers about the schedule until a prespecified switch period and then reveal the entire schedule afterward. We show that an optimal dilatory policy can significantly lower the number of farms burnt compared with that under the full-disclosure and the no-disclosure policies. Using data from the rice-wheat crop system in northwestern India, we demonstrate that the optimal dilatory policy can reduce CO2and black-carbon emissions by 17% on average. We also examine the impact of the government’s policy on the trade-off between environmental damage and farmers’ welfare.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03030 .</content>

    <title>A Simple Approach for Measuring Higher-Order Arrow-Pratt Coefficients of Risk Aversion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the importance of the second-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion is well established, the importance of higher-order risk attitudes has only recently begun to be recognized. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to directly measure higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion in an expected utility framework using choices between compound lotteries and show how it can be easily implemented in behavioral studies. Specifically, we provide a theoretical basis for using risk apportionment to reveal the intensity of higher-order risk attitudes, and then draw upon our theoretical results to develop a simple, systematic, and generalizable procedure for eliciting higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients. We demonstrate our approach in a laboratory experiment and find that the modal second-order, third-order, and fourth-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients are positive and small. Further, we find that degrees of risk aversion are positively correlated across orders. Additionally, we discuss alternative implementations of our procedure.This paper was accepted by Peng Sun, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: R. J.

    <title>Portfolio Optimization Based on Almost Second-Degree Stochastic Dominance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In portfolio optimization, the computational complexity of implementing almost stochastic dominance has limited its practical applications. In this study, we introduce an optimization framework aimed at identifying the optimal portfolio that outperforms a specified benchmark under almost second-degree stochastic dominance (ASSD). Our approach involves discretizing the return range and establishing both sufficient and necessary conditions for ASSD. We then propose a three-step iterative procedure: first, identifying a candidate portfolio; second, assessing its optimality; and third, refining the discretization scheme. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the portfolio identified through this iterative process improves with each iteration, ultimately converging to the optimal solution. Our empirical study, utilizing industry portfolios, demonstrates the efficacy of our approach by consistently identifying an optimal portfolio within a few iterations. Furthermore, comparative analysis against other decision criteria, such as mean-variance, second-degree stochastic dominance, and third-degree stochastic dominance, reveals that ASSD generally leads to portfolios with higher out-of-sample average excess returns but also entails increased variations and risks.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: C.

    <title>Employee Board Representation and Capital Investment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how parity employee representation (PER) on corporate boards affects firms’ capital investments. In Germany, PER is legally mandated for firms with more than 2,000 domestic employees, but not for those below this threshold. Exploiting this discontinuity, we show that PER has heterogeneous effects on firms operating in diverse environments. For firms experiencing positive growth, PER increases their responsiveness to investment opportunities, suggesting that employee participation increases firms’ ability to exploit growth options. The effect through growth options is particularly salient in situations in which growth options are highly valuable. In contrast, for firms experiencing negative growth, PER reduces investment responsiveness, suggesting that employees resist the exercise of abandonment options. This effect is more pronounced in firms with high labor intensity, in which employees are likely to have a strong voice. Furthermore, operational risk moderates the effects of employee representation––the positive effect through growth options is attenuated in high-risk firms and the negative effect through abandonment options is exacerbated, thereby suggesting that employee board representatives are less interested in pursuing growth where businesses are relatively risky, and they protect their constituents more forcefully in high-risk environments. Moreover, the positive effect of PER on exploiting growth options is attenuated by collective bargaining agreements, while its effect through abandonment options is little affected. Evidence from stock price behavior further supports the viewpoint that employee representation affects capital investment. Our findings are relevant to policymakers as well as to firms’ various stakeholders.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by China’s National Science Foundation [Grants 72032003, 72102166]; China’s Ministry of Education [111 Project (B18033)]; and China’s Ministry of Education (Project of Key Research Institutes of Humanities and Social Science in Universities [22JJD790094]).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03495 .</content>

    <title>Why Wages Don’t Fall in Jobs with Incomplete Contracts</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how the incompleteness of an employment contract—discretionary and noncontractible effort—can affect an employer’s decision about cutting nominal wages. Using matched employer-employee payroll data from Great Britain linked to a survey of managers, we find support for the main predictions of a stylized theoretical framework of wage determination: nominal cuts are at most half as likely when managers believe that their employees have significant discretion over how they do their work, although the involvement of employees, via information sharing, reduces this correlation. We also describe how contract incompleteness and wage cuts vary across different jobs. These findings provide the first observational quantitative evidence that managerial beliefs about contractual incompleteness can account for their hesitancy over nominal wage cuts. This has long been conjectured by economists based on anecdotes, qualitative surveys, and laboratory and field experiments.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: M.

    <title>The Importance of Unemployment Risk for Individual Savings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we use a novel natural experiment and Norwegian tax data to quantify the causal impact of unemployment risk on individual savings. By comparing individuals who live in the same area but face different increases in risk, we show that a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment rates increases safe assets by 1.3%. Reassuringly, this effect is driven by low-tenured workers, who face the highest increase in risk. Savings in risky financial assets remain unaffected, implying a decrease in the overall risky share of individual portfolios. We use two independent approaches, relying either on cross-sectional variation or time series variation, to quantify the importance of job loss risk in accounting for higher savings during recessions. Our results suggest that unemployment risk can explain 60%–80% of the recession-induced increase in safe assets.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00987 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial statement audits for public companies require auditors to test the internal controls over the client’s information systems that are material to the financial reporting process. Given the increasingly integrated nature of corporate data and control systems, a standard audit may have a positive effect on client firms’ other information systems, such as those that help prevent data breaches. In this paper, I provide evidence on whether and how auditors help prevent data breaches. Using plausibly exogenous improvements in auditing due to regulatory inspections and auditors’ cross-client learning, I find a decreased likelihood of data breaches among these auditors’ clients. Institutional insights gathered from interviews with accounting firm partners and industry professionals suggest two mechanisms for the role of auditors in preventing data breaches: the provision of relevant information and incentives for internal controls. Collectively, the findings provide evidence that improving accounting information systems can have a positive impact on nonaccounting systems.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: I gratefully acknowledge financial support from Columbia Business School, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the Deloitte Foundation, and the Bradley Fellowship awarded by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01357 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by blockchain applications in the fresh produce industry, we consider a newsvendor problem in which a retailer faces stochastic and freshness-dependent consumer demand. The retailer can adopt blockchain technology to have more transparent information on the freshness of supply. We quantify the value of blockchain-enabled freshness transparency by deriving closed-form expressions for the retailer’s expected profit growth and food waste reduction brought by blockchain adoption. Using publicly available data, we provide a numerical example illustrating that for Walmart’s strawberry business in the United States (which is about only 4% of Walmart’s fresh produce sales), blockchain can increase annual profit by [Formula: see text] million while eliminating 23 million pounds of food waste annually through operational improvements. Despite this substantial value for the retailer, blockchain adoption can decrease the expected profit of the retailer’s supplier. We design a family of threshold-type smart contracts contingent on a blockchain-based freshness consensus and examine when such contracts offer a win-win proposition to the retailer and the supplier. Moreover, when the retailer offers freshness-based price discounts, we find that less fresh supply leads to less food waste. In contrast, when the supplier adjusts the wholesale price based on freshness, less fresh supply causes more food waste. We also generalize our findings to the cases of (i) dual sourcing, (ii) noisy measurements in the Internet of Things sensors feeding data into blockchain, and (iii) the retailer’s culling processes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02949 .</content>

    <title>Delaying Informed Consent: An Empirical Investigation of Mobile Apps’ Upgrade Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In response to users’ evolving desire for choice and control over their personal data, numerous platforms across sectors have been updating privacy policies. Unlike public regulations that mandate uniform compliance, many platforms grant a more flexible time window for complementors to adopt privacy policies. Although several studies have examined the impact of privacy policies, the consequences of delayed policy adoption under time flexibility remain largely unexplored. This study is among the first to investigate the impact of apps delaying policy adoption in the context of a privacy policy change. The context of our research is the upgrade to Android version 6.0, which gave consumers more control over their personal data. Apps were given a three-year grace period to adopt the new privacy policy, during which apps that did not adopt the policy could still run on the latest Android version. We leverage this variation in policy adoption by apps to examine its impact on apps’ marketplace outcomes. By installing over 13,691 popular apps on emulators, we detect exactly when each app upgrades to version 6.0. We combine this unique data set with multiple data sets to quantify the impact of delaying the upgrade. We find that delaying the upgrade results in a significant loss of downloads and user ratings for apps. Frequently maintaining the apps without upgrading can only partially mitigate these declines. In further examining who delays upgrades and why, we find that apps that display in-app advertising and overreach for permissions are more likely to delay upgrading, suggesting a strategic trade-off between marketplace outcomes and the ability to collect data continuously. The findings of our study highlight the need to carefully consider participants’ potential strategic behaviors in designing policy implementation. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets at the University of Maryland is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00334 .</content>

    <title>Optimal Control of Service Systems with Heterogeneous Servers and Priority Customers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study service systems with parallel servers and random customer arrivals and focus on the waiting cost of customers. Using a Markov decision process (MDP) modeling approach, we analytically characterize the structures of the optimal dynamic server assignment policies for two important systems, one consisting of multiple homogeneous servers and two classes of customers and the other consisting of two heterogeneous servers and multiple classes of customers. Based on the obtained results, we propose a threshold-type heuristic policy for the generalized system consisting of multiple heterogeneous servers and multiple classes of customers. To design such a heuristic policy, we first develop techniques for the performance evaluation of general threshold-type policies with any given threshold values. We then construct a path to search for the optimal threshold values. We compare the performance of the best threshold-type heuristic policy with that of the optimal policy and show that our proposed heuristic policy is computationally efficient yet generates great performance. To derive additional managerial insights, we compare the system under our threshold-type dynamic server assignment policy with other commonly seen and simple systems, such as the dedicated system and the work-conserving flexible priority system. The clear performance advantage observed from extensive numerical experiments demonstrates the importance and usefulness of dynamic server assignment control for systems serving multiple classes of customer arrivals. Finally, we extend our analysis to incorporate customer-dependent service rates and sojourn-time minimization performance metrics.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [16500921, 16505819] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [72201233, 72301222].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01228 .</content>

    <title>Penalty or Reward? The Effect of Social Disincentives on Online Users’ Contributions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research on online communities has primarily demonstrated that users are motivated by social rewards or social incentives such as positive social feedback and enhanced reputation. In contrast, this study examines how social penalties, or social disincentives, including negative social feedback and loss in reputation, influence online users’ voluntary contributions in the short and long term. We develop empirical models to investigate reviewers’ decisions on whether to contribute (i.e., review incidence decision) and how much to contribute (i.e., quality-adjusted review effort decision) over time. Using a state-space model, we capture the dynamics in reviewers’ latent review motivation that stems from both social incentives and social disincentives. Based on a unique data set from the Amazon review system, our analysis shows that, surprisingly, social disincentives increase reviewers’ motivations to contribute more frequently and devote more effort to contributions. Such effects prevail in both the short and long term. In addition, a reviewer’s real name identity and experience moderate the impact of social disincentives on a reviewer’s contribution decisions. We find that loss in reputation has more impact on less experienced reviewers and anonymous reviewers. Our policy simulation exercise suggests that not providing negative social feedback could diminish reviewers’ review propensity by 7.85% (2.39%) and review effort by 14.82% (4.50%) in the short term (long term). Not allowing reputation loss on a review site decreases reviewers’ review propensity by 2.82% (1.40%) and review effort by 7.52% (3.45%) in the short term (long term).This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01115 .</content>

    <title>Self-Regulation for Reputation-Sensitive Buyers: SA8000 in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industries and firms have diverse motives for adopting self-regulatory institutions. This research develops and tests propositions about one motive—exploiting opportunities to do business with reputation-sensitive buyers—as distinct from self-regulation to defend against regulatory or activist threats. To study the adoption and effects of self-regulation for reputation-sensitive buyers, we study the SA8000 socially responsible employment certification among large firms in China in the early 2000s. Using official longitudinal industrial microdata, we test hypotheses generated by this assumed motive for self-regulation and find that (a) despite concerns about the corruptibility of certification bodies, SA8000 adopters in China exhibited higher precertification worker wages than comparable nonadopters, (b) self-regulation led to increased employment and sales to foreign markets, where reputation-sensitive buyers are concentrated, (c) the positive effect on exports was greater than the (insignificant, negatively signed) effect on domestic sales, and (d) there is no evidence that self-regulation increased worker wages beyond the initial high start. Contrasting these findings with prior research on industry self-regulation for other motives, this study highlights how both adoption patterns and downstream effects differ according to the audience for self-regulation.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01306 .</content>

    <title>When Newspapers Fail to Deter Corporate Illegality: The Constraining Effects of Economic Institutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents aim to restrict corporate illegality, yet its prevalence highlights inconsistencies in enforcement mechanisms. To explore this issue, we examine how newspapers reduce corporate illegality by imposing ethical norms on firms. Analysing data from firms in 29 countries, we find that higher newspaper reach is only moderately associated with lower levels of corporate illegality due to key boundary conditions. Specifically, we leverage institutional anomie theory as a framework to identify and test three ways in which economic institutions constrain newspapers' ethical norm‐setting role. The negative association between newspaper reach and corporate illegality is weakened in countries with strong cultural pressure to succeed or pervasive economic penetration into newspapers. However, firm‐level shareholder orientation does not moderate this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized analyses of media landscapes and the role of economic institutions in undermining social control processes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study analyzes 6 million civil judgments in China from 2014 to 2018, documenting gender disparities that disfavor female litigants. We investigate the impact of an open justice reform that mandated courts to broadcast legal proceedings live on a centralized online platform. By exploiting variations in its implementation across courts and over time and employing both difference-in-differences and Bartik IV approaches, we find that gender disparities in chances of winning decrease as broadcast intensity increases. Analysis of the textual content of judicial decisions provides further evidence that these changes in judicial outcomes stem from altered judge behaviors (i.e., attention and effort) under enhanced judicial transparency. Our results demonstrate how information technology shapes judges’ conduct, underscoring its broader potential to improve accountability in public institutions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers introducing asymmetric privacy in the design of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and digital currencies more generally to preserve the privacy of money spent while keeping the benefits of digital records for money received. It is shown that this feature would help minimize real distortions between consumers, firms, and financiers while enabling tax optimization and better access to external financing. Protecting the privacy of consumers is desirable from a welfare and efficiency standpoint as long as there exist noticeable privacy concerns. Implementing asymmetric privacy is technologically feasible, using, for instance, zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy tools.This paper has been accepted by Lin William Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06830 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Passive bond funds provide predictable demand for newly issued corporate bonds included in popular indices. By issuing index-eligible bonds, firms can take advantage of this passive demand and improve bond characteristics unrelated to index eligibility. To this end, firms issue a disproportionate number of bonds with face value just sufficient to be included in major bond indices. Higher passive demand is associated with larger bonds. Following an increase in the index size threshold, some firms withdraw from the bond market while others respond by issuing larger bonds at the new threshold.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01999 .</content>

    <title>Third-Party Software Development Kit Utilization and Mobile App Market Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the highly competitive mobile market, third-party vendors located outside the purview of hosting mobile platforms are becoming major suppliers of functional tool kits for mobile app development and innovation. However, app developers face challenges in navigating the use of third-party software development kits (SDKs) to enhance app performance. Drawing on the platform ecosystem literature, this study examines the roles of third-party SDKs, platform owners, and mobile app developers from a boundary-spanning perspective, emphasizing their respective contributions to shaping the functional value of third-party SDKs as boundary objects. By analyzing a longitudinal data set of 335,958 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play, we find that integrating more third-party SDKs can significantly boost daily active users, especially when tool-type SDKs are utilized. However, this positive effect diminishes following platform updates that redefine platform boundaries and as developers gain more platform-specific experience. This study highlights the importance of balanced governance in platform ecosystems to sustain market growth, offering actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and industry leaders in shaping the future of mobile app markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School districts historically approached conflict resolution from the perspective that suspending disruptive students was necessary to protect their classmates, even if this caused harm to perceived offenders. Restorative practices (RP)—focusing on reparation, accountability, and shared ownership of disciplinary justice—are designed to address undesirable behavior without harming students. We study Chicago Public Schools’ adoption of RP and find that suspensions and arrests decreased, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test score value added, ruling out meaningful average declines. We estimate a 15 percent decrease in out-of-school arrests, consistent with RP substantively changing student behavior. (JEL D63, D74, D91, I21, I28, J15, J16)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that administrative hourly wage data exhibit considerable bunching at round numbers. We run two experiments randomizing wages around $0.10 and $1.00 to experimentally measure left-digit bias for identical tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk; we fail to find any evidence of discontinuity in the labor supply function at round numbers despite estimating a considerable degree of monopsony. We replicate these results in administrative worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon. We can rule out inattention estimates found in the behavioral product market literature. We provide evidence that firms “misoptimize” wage setting. More monopsony requires less employer misoptimization to explain bunching. (JEL D22, J22, J31, J42)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the employer's role in unemployment insurance (UI) take-up. Employer effects on claiming and appeals are substantial, and those effects are negatively correlated, consistent with appeals deterring claims. Low-wage workers are less likely to claim and more likely to have their claims appealed than median-wage workers. Employer effects help explain these income gradients, so equalizing employer effects on claiming would increase the progressivity of UI. Finally, the main source of targeting error in UI is that eligible workers do not claim. (JEL J22, J31, J63, J64, J65)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists routinely make functional form assumptions on demand curves to derive welfare conclusions. How sensitive are these conclusions to such assumptions? In this paper, we develop robustness measures that quantify the extent to which the true demand curve must deviate from common functional form assumptions in order to overturn a welfare conclusion. We parametrize this variability in terms of the gradient and curvature of the demand curve. By leveraging tools from information design, we show that our measures are easy to compute. Our measures are also flexible and easy to use, as we illustrate through empirical applications. (JEL D01, D60, F13, H55, Q48)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the direct effects and indirect spillover effects of investment tax credits on firms. Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm's investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects. (JEL D22, H25, H32, J23, L25, L60, R11)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a randomized trial among 14,545 households in rural Burkina Faso to test the oft-cited hypothesis that limited access to contraception is an important driver of high fertility rates in West Africa. We do not find support for this hypothesis. Women who were given free access to modern contraception for three years did not have lower birth rates; we can reject even modest effects. We cross-randomized additional interventions to address inefficiencies that might depress demand for free contraception, specifically misperceptions about the child mortality rate and social norms. Free contraception did not significantly influence fertility even in combination with these interventions. (JEL D12, J13, J16, J18, O12)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Common values auction models, where bidder decisions depend on noisy signals of common values, provide predictions about Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes. In settings where these common values can be estimated, these predictions can be tested. We propose a series of tests, robust to assumptions about the signal structure, to determine whether the observed data could have been generated by a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In the setting of oil and gas lease auctions in New Mexico, we find evidence that participation decisions are correlated and that participants systematically underbid in light of ex post outcomes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study changes in political discourse during campaigns, using a novel dataset of candidate websites for US House elections, 2002–2016, and manifestos for French parliamentary and local elections, 1958–2022. We find that candidates move to the center in ideology and rhetorical complexity between the first round (or primary) and the second round (or general election). This convergence reflects candidates’ strategic adjustment to their opponents, as predicted by Downsian competition: Using an RDD we show that candidates converge to the platform of opponents who narrowly qualified for the last round as opposed to those who narrowly failed to qualify.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Accelerated investment in electricity transmission could reduce total costs and enhance renewable integration. I document static allocative inefficiencies induced by incomplete market integration in 2 major US markets; these have risen over time and totaled $2 billion in 2022. I also argue that estimating firm-level impacts is important, as incumbents may have the power to block new lines and other reforms. I show that 4 firms would have experienced a collective $1.3 billion drop in net revenues in 2022 had the market been integrated, and there are reports of some of these firms blocking transmission projects.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Galí (2014) showed that a monetary policy rule that raises rates when bubbles exceed some steady-state benchmark can paradoxically lead to larger deviations from steady state. Nevertheless, this comment shows that a central bank can always dampen a bubble by setting a higher-than-expected rate, although it may have to raise the rate aggressively. This is a different point from the Miao, Shen, and Wang (2019) comment on Galí (2014). They showed that when the central bank targets a different steady state than Galí considered, raising rates when bubbles exceed this alternative benchmark leads to smaller deviations from steady state.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a framework to extend the strategic form analysis of cursed equilibrium (CE) developed by Eyster and Rabin (2005) to multistage games. The approach uses behavioral strategies rather than normal form mixed strategies and imposes sequential rationality. We define and characterize properties of cursed sequential equilibrium (CSE) and apply it to four canonical economic applications: signaling games, reputation building, durable goods monopoly, and the dirty faces game. These applications illustrate various implications of CSE, show how and why it differs from sequential equilibrium and CE, and provide evidence from laboratory experiments that support the empirical relevance of CSE.

    <title>Refugees at the door: Initial funding partners and new venture performance in a changing emerging market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs must navigate complex environmental shifts that significantly impact firm survival. In this paper, we investigate how different firm‐level logics influence new venture survival in Jordan during changing social and economic conditions, such as a refugee influx. Our study reveals that these shifting environmental dynamics can differentially alter the performance outcomes of firms based on their internal logics that drive venture strategy. This dynamic relationship underscores how varying firm‐level logics can alter the impact of environmental changes on new venture performance. These findings provide guidance to entrepreneurs to be aware of their venture's underlying values and principles and consider how they may impact business decisions and outcomes in the face of changing circumstances.Managerial SummaryThis study examines the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on new venture performance in Jordan, specifically investigating whether ventures' survival was affected by the source of their initial funding. The results show that ventures that received their initial funding from family were less likely to survive than those that received their initial funding from banks when significant numbers of refugees entered Jordan. Our paper suggests that this difference may be due to how the guiding principles of firms shaped decisions around resource allocation and strategic adaptation. For entrepreneurs and investors, this suggests that the source of a venture's initial funding can be a hidden strength or vulnerability, depending on the social and economic disruptions it faces.</content>

    <title>Air pollution and managers’ forecasting ability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between U.S. managers’ short-term exposure to air pollution and their forecasting ability. We focus on air pollution due to PM2.5, a fine particulate matter that can easily penetrate an indoor, climate-controlled environment. We show that the short-term ambient PM2.5level at the firm’s headquarters before a management earnings forecast issuance is negatively associated with the accuracy of the forecast. Also, the short-term ambient PM2.5level before an earnings announcement is negatively related to the likelihood of a concurrent management forecast issuance. These relations occur at PM2.5levels below the U.S. air quality standard. A battery of additional tests validate these findings. These results suggest that a transitory exposure to PM2.5at levels common in the United States temporarily decreases managers’ forecasting ability. The temporary cognitive impairment from short-term exposure to modest levels of PM2.5, as documented in epidemiological studies, is presumably the reason.</content>

    <title>Improving Cystic Fibrosis Screening Through a Novel Testing Design</title>
    <updated>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newborn screening (NBS) plays a key role in detecting life-threatening genetic disorders, with cystic fibrosis (CF) being a prominent example. Having CF requires both copies of the CFTR gene (one inherited from each parent) to be pathogenic variants. With over 1,000 CF-causing variant types, a genetic test that can detect enough variant types for sufficient screening accuracy is expensive and capacity-constrained. Consequently, in the US, the first tier of testing uses an inexpensive biochemical test that measures immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, which are often elevated in CF cases. Genetic testing is reserved for a small fraction of newborns with elevated IRT levels, based on an IRT threshold. However, setting an optimal IRT threshold that balances sensitivity with overall screening cost and genetic testing capacity is challenging, which is exacerbated by variations in IRT levels and CF prevalences among different racial/ethnic groups. As a result, the current practice of using a single IRT threshold for all newborns is not necessarily the most efficient or equitable strategy.
            
            This paper introduces a novel screening design that integrates an inexpensive small-panel genetic test with an IRT test in the first tier of testing. This strategy customizes IRT thresholds based on the number of variants detected by the small-panel genetic test. This design leads to novel optimization problems, including variant type selection for the small-panel genetic test and IRT threshold customization. We establish key structural properties of optimal IRT thresholds and develop Pareto frontiers that inform decision-makers about the efficiency versus equity trade-off, considering a specific minimax type equity measure. The case study, utilizing CF NBS data from the states of New York and California, demonstrates the potential efficiency and equity gains of this novel approach compared to current practice and race-based benchmarks. This research offers valuable insights and methodologies for improving CF NBS processes, and has implications for public policy decision-making.</content>

    <title>Rate-Optimal Online Learning for Dynamic Assortment Selection with Positioning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study addresses a key challenge in online retail: product positioning. The authors propose a novel online learning framework called dynamic assortment selection with positioning (DAP). Unlike traditional models that focus solely on item selection, DAP also learns optimal product placement to maximize revenue. The researchers model customer choices using a multinomial logit framework, where item appeal depends on both intrinsic preference and display position. They demonstrate that ignoring position effects leads to suboptimal performance and introduce a new algorithm, TLR-UCB, which effectively incorporates adaptive position-dependent feedback through a geometric linear bandit structure and truncated linear regression techniques. Theoretical analysis confirms that TLR-UCB achieves optimal learning efficiency. To handle unknown position effects, they further develop EI-TLR, a two-stage policy that jointly estimates customer preferences and positioning impacts before applying a generalized TLR-UCB procedure. Extensive simulations show that both TLR-UCB and EI-TLR significantly outperform existing benchmarks, offering powerful tools for dynamic, data-driven assortment and layout optimization in online marketplaces.</content>

    <title>Performance Ranks, Conformity, and Cooperation: Evidence from a Sweater Factory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Performance ranking can trigger multiple social incentives for workers. On one hand, it offers status rewards to induce them to increase effort. On the other, better-ranked workers may reduce effort to conform to coworkers’ productivity in fear of social retribution. This paper uses a field experiment in a sweater factory to disentangle the incentives underlying performance ranks. Treated workers receive ranks either privately or publicly. I find that private ranks do not have any effect on average but that public ranks reduce worker productivity. Additional evidence confirms that productivity declines because of workers’ social concerns and their desire to conform to the productivity of their friends. Cooperation between workers decreases too but with limited effect on productivity. The paper illustrates how inducing worker competition may be counterproductive for firms.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Financial support from the Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries, Centre for Economic Policy Research [PEDL ERG 4362] and the DFG through CRC TRR 190 [Project 280092119] are gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01381 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The estimation of loss distributions for dynamic portfolios requires the simulation of scenarios representing realistic joint dynamics of their components. We propose a novel data-driven approach for simulating realistic, high-dimensional multiasset scenarios, focusing on accurately representing tail risk for a class of static and dynamic trading strategies. We exploit the joint elicitability property of Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall to design a Generative Adversarial Network that learns to simulate price scenarios preserving these tail risk features. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on synthetic and market data sets through detailed numerical experiments. In contrast to previously proposed data-driven scenario generators, our proposed method correctly captures tail risk for a broad class of trading strategies and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. In addition, combining our method with principal component analysis of the input data enhances its scalability to large-dimensional multiasset time series, setting our framework apart from the univariate settings commonly considered in the literature.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00936 .</content>

    <title>Boosting Sales and Customer Welfare from Premade Foods (Let the Freshest Chicken Fly off the Shelf First)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a grocery retailer’s management of a premade food product. The retailer’s goal is to maximize a weighted sum of direct profit and customer welfare. Multiple items of the product are produced in batches and immediately displayed for sale. Considering that each item’s quality decreases while it sits on the shelf, the retailer chooses the shelf life, whether to issue items in first-in-first-out (FIFO) or last-in-first-out (LIFO) order, whether to timestamp items, and how to price items. In a base model, we find that the retailer should use LIFO issuance and not timestamp items. The intuition is that this increases customer welfare and allows for a longer shelf life, increasing sales and thus reducing waste. By extending the model, we identify features that can make FIFO optimal (such as a holding cost, upper bound on the shelf life, age-dependent disposal cost, or customer risk or loss aversion), and we show how customer heterogeneity can favor timestamps. Lastly, we show how a mandate to donate unsold food items (as implemented in France and California) can motivate a retailer to increase the shelf life, thereby reducing the quality and quantity of donated items.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01246 .</content>

    <title>Trade-Offs in Leveraging External Data Capabilities: Evidence from a Field Experiment in an Online Search Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly leverage external entities’ data capabilities to unlock improvements in their offerings, but measuring the impact of such capabilities is challenging. Collaborating with the search team at a technology company, we analyzed a large-scale field experiment in which we randomized access to an external, leading search engine’s autocomplete application programming interface (API) for more than two million users over 108 days. We measure the causal effects of removing API access on two performance metrics of the focal company’s search product: (a) clickthrough rate (CTR) on search suggestions and (b) CTR on the search engine results page. We find that, on average, compared with the baseline with API access, removing API access reduces the search suggestion CTR by 4.6%. Further, exploiting the experimental variation, we use an instrumental variables approach to establish that a 10% increase (decrease) in CTR on search suggestions leads to a 1.85% increase (decrease) in CTR on top-slot search results. However, the negative effect of removing API access becomes less negative over time with the effect magnitude in the longer term being half what we would have obtained with a short-term experiment. We provide suggestive mechanism evidence of the longer term effect: the focal company’s reliance on the leading search engine’s data capability tapers off the accumulation of internal data and then limits the improvement of its autocomplete predictions. This research informs managers of a critical trade-off in leveraging external data capabilities and sheds light on regulations, such as the Digital Markets Act, that mandate data sharing by large digital platforms.This paper was accepted by DJ Wu, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72442015, 72171132, and 72171146] and the China Scholarship Council [Grant 202206230110].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01834 .</content>

    <title>Economic Substance Behind Texas Political Anti-ESG Sanctions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A stark contrast exists between the stated preferences of politicians in the so-called blue states (Democrats) and those in red states (Republicans) on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. We examine whether these polarized political stances are reflected in the investment strategies of respective states’ pension funds. We examine a Texas directive that the state agencies divest from investment companies that profess a pro-ESG stance and allegedly “boycott” energy stocks. We find that funds banned by the Texas directive, despite carrying ESG-focused titles, are largely indexers with a tilt slightly away from energy stocks and slightly toward technology stocks. Banning such funds would make little difference to Texas pensioners or Texas energy companies, because the returns and stock holdings of banned funds are not meaningfully different from those of size-matched funds that do not proclaim an ESG focus. Pension funds in red states do not act per their politicians’ stance and largely follow market trends in their investment strategies. They have similar exposures to technology and energy stocks, as do pension funds in blue states. We conclude that the vehement pro– and anti–fossil fuel proclamations of blue and red states’ politicians, respectively, are not observed in their own state pension funds’ investment policies over which politicians have better control than on external funds.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

    <title>EXPRESS: Healthy Relationships and Healthy Eating: How Stressful Events and Social Support Affect Indulgence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how acute stress and social support jointly influence indulgent food decision making using lab experiments and a unique combination of large-scale datasets. Our experiments reveal that social support moderates the effect of stress on indulgent food choices, with individuals with lower support more likely to indulge under stress. We argue that this occurs because social support provides psychological resources that help individuals regulate their behavior under stress. Using a process-by-moderation approach, we demonstrate that providing contextual support, enhancing perceived control, and promoting deliberative thinking attenuate the effect of low social support on indulgent behavior under stress. At a broader level, we test these predictions by analyzing the impact of Hurricane Sandy, an exogenous stressor, on indulgent food purchases. A Difference-in-Difference (DiD) analysis in a natural experiment reveals that while Sandy-affected areas experienced a significant rise in indulgent food sales, this increase was attenuated in communities with higher social support, suggesting that the availability of social resources plays a critical role in moderating stress-driven consumption. Together, our research highlights how social support shapes stress-induced consumption patterns and identifies novel factors that affect indulgent food choices on a real-world and large-scale basis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing portfolio combination rules that optimize the out-of-sample performance under parameter uncertainty assume multivariate normally distributed returns. However, we show that this assumption is not innocuous because fat tails in returns lead to poorer out-of-sample performance of the sample mean–variance and sample global minimum-variance (GMV) portfolios relative to normality. Consequently, when returns are fat-tailed, portfolio combination rules should allocate less to the sample mean–variance and sample GMV portfolios, and more to the risk-free asset, than the normality assumption prescribes. Empirical evidence shows that accounting for fat tails in the construction of optimal portfolio combination rules significantly improves their out-of-sample performance.</content>

    <title>The right to decide: A decision‐based perspective on corporate stakeholder governance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complications arise when stakeholders with heterogeneous and potentially misaligned preferences are considered in corporate decisions. This paper examines how high‐level decision‐making corporate forums, such as boards, can address such heterogeneous claims. We identify three corporate stakeholder governance types depending on the externalities that they generate (which can consider the contributing stakeholders or encompass a broader set of stakeholders affected by the company's operations) and, based on three critical governance attributes (allocation of control rights, corporate objectives, and deliberation mechanisms), identify governance structures that generate benefits to the targeted stakeholders (based on the generated externalities) at a lower governance cost. We also propose that structures managing broad externalities facilitate problem formulation (besides solving) and more effectively deal with contexts involving ill‐defined problems.Managerial SummaryIn the corporate governance of for‐profit firms, there have been calls to consider the demands of multiple stakeholders and even engage them in the decision‐making process. However, dealing with multiple stakeholders is costly; their perspectives often differ markedly, creating conflict and risking impasse. Focusing on three critical attributes of boards (decision rights, corporate objective, and decision‐making mechanisms), we identify three main types of stakeholder‐oriented corporate governance structures that increasingly broaden the set of stakeholders considered while keeping decision‐making costs manageable. We argue that structures accommodating broader stakeholder interests, although costly, are relatively more effective when board members face problems that are difficult to characterize and that may require different opinions and perspectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive overview of accounting-related regulatory changes (financial accounting, auditing, tax, and other disclosures) in the 27 European Union countries and the United Kingdom since 1993 based on an extensive literature review, survey, and topic and country expert input. Across all countries and years, we find that more than 16 regulatory events occur in a typical difference-in-differences research design that includes pre- and post-periods of four years. On average 3.4 out of four accounting disciplines are affected, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary awareness. Our accompanying website (http://www.eu-regulations.com) offers visual representations of these events, regulation summaries, literature links, and source documents, all by country. This work aims to (1) lower the cost for researchers, reviewers, and editors to understand the EU’s evolving regulatory landscape; (2) improve research designs by identifying concurrent regulatory events; and (3) highlight research opportunities for those studying the EU or specific member states.</content>

    <title>Situational Support for Corruption: A Two-Part Field Experiment on Collusive vs. Extortive Bribery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reports a two-part field experiment study that demonstrates that negative externality primes commonly used in anticorruption campaigns and academic research on collusive corruption are more effective in reducing participation in corruption among the minority of people who already reject the private-public trade-off inherent in collusive corruption than they are in changing the behavior of those who are tolerant of it. Using a random sample of 1,403 residents of Nairobi County, Kenya, we first administered an in-person vignette experiment that measures respondents’ attitudes regarding collusive bribes compared with more coercive types. Collusive bribes are judged more acceptable across multiple outcome measures because they provide the greatest private benefits, but collusive bribes are also rated as the most unethical and at least as harmful to public goods as coercive payments. Several days later, we administered a behavioral experiment to the same respondents, which provided an opportunity to collude with a corrupt representative of the research team to receive illicit additional compensation for participating in the study. A negative externality prime was effective in reducing acceptance of the corrupt opportunity among respondents who rejected the trade-off between self-interested benefits and harming public goods in the vignette experiment. A concluding discussion addresses the high overall acceptance rate of the collusive offer and suggests directions for future interventions. Lastly, we generalize our results to a middle-range theory of organizational misconduct involving transactions between corrupt agents and the public.Funding: This work was supported by the University of South Carolina Sonoco International Business Department’s Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) [Grant P220A220013-23], received from the U.S. Department of Education.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18659 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the consequences of an intrusive debt-collection tactic that targets delinquent borrowers’ social circles. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that some of the delinquent loans are not worked on because of collection agents’ excessive workload. Using two approaches to estimate the local treatment effect, we show that this social-shaming tactic backfires and substantially increases the borrowers’ default rate. Borrowers with better outside options for credit access and male borrowers respond more strongly after they are shamed socially. These findings are in general consistent with the negative reciprocity interpretation; angered borrowers retaliate by defaulting on their loans.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00681 .</content>

    <title>When Emotion AI Meets Strategic Users</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When organizations adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize individuals’ negative emotions and accordingly allocate limited resources, strategic users are incentivized to game the system by misrepresenting their emotions. The value of AI in automating such emotion-driven allocation may be undermined by gaming behavior, algorithmic noise in emotion detection, and the spillover effect of negative emotions. We develop a game-theoretical model to understand emotion AI adoption, particularly in customer care, and analyze the design of the associated allocation policies. We find that adopting emotion AI is valuable if the spillover effect of negative emotions is negligible compared with resource misallocation loss, regardless of algorithmic noise and gaming behavior. We also quantify the welfare impacts of emotion AI on the users, organization, and society. Notably, a stronger AI is not always socially desirable and regulation on emotion-driven allocation is needed. Finally, we characterize conditions under which leveraging the AI system is preferred to hiring human employees in emotion-driven allocation. We also explore the alternative application of using emotion AI to monitor strategic employees and compare it with hiring a human manager for monitoring. Intriguingly, algorithmic noise may increase the profit of AI monitoring. Our work provides implications for designing, adopting, and regulating emotion AI.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit staggered releases of satellite data on parking lot traffic across U.S. retailers and conduct the stacked Poisson regression to identify the causal effect of big data availability on corporate voluntary disclosure. We document a significant decrease in management good news forecasts following the satellite data release, whereas bad news forecasts are unaffected. The asymmetric decrease cannot be explained by the demand-side substitution hypothesis. Our evidence suggests that the supply-side “meeting guidance” hypothesis is likely to account for the disappearing good news forecasts. We also derive cross-sectional predictions from the hypothesis and confirm them in the data: The decrease in good news forecasts is more pronounced among short-horizon quarterly guidance than long-term forecasts and when firms have higher institutional ownership, higher operating uncertainty, and higher litigation risk of missing guidance.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: S.

    <title>Entrepreneurial Fundraising Strategies and the Gender Gap: Theory and Evidence from Equity Crowdfunding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Start-ups with female founders typically raise less money than their male counterparts. Prior literature explores investor demand and finds evidence of assortative matching, where investors prefer to invest in entrepreneurs of their own gender. In the context of equity crowdfunding, we examine the supply side of the gender funding gap, asking how female and male founders anticipate different investor demand. We develop an assortative matching theory that generates four benchmark predictions, namely that female founders (i) ask for less funding, (ii) have the same campaign success probability, (iii) receive less funding if successful, and (iv) have the same overfunding ratio, defined as the ratio of funding received over funding requested. Leveraging proprietary data from a UK equity crowdfunding platform that includes both successful and unsuccessful ventures, the evidence matches the first three predictions, also finding that all-female teams have larger funding gaps than mixed-gender teams. For the overfunding ratio, we find that mixed-gender (all-female) teams have higher (lower) overfunding ratios than the all-male benchmark. We also find that female investors fund mixed-gender teams relatively more, whereas male investors give disproportionately less to all-female teams. Gender gaps increase for more capital-intensive ventures.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Said Business School, University of Oxford [John Fell Fund] and the Coller Institute of Venture at Tel Aviv University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06658 .</content>

    <title>Evaluating the Effect of Soda Taxes Using a Dynamic Model of Rational Addiction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The obesity rate has grown to epidemic proportions in the United States. Recent scientific studies suggest that excess intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is one of the primary contributors to weight gain. One option to address the growing obesity epidemic is to discourage SSB consumption through fiscal policies such as imposing a soda excise tax. In this paper, we apply the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction to present evidence that consumers are rationally addicted to the consumption of soda drinks that contain caffeine and/or sugar. Motivated by the evidence, we build a dynamic structural model to quantify the impact of soda taxes on soda purchases and consumption and study the role of addiction in influencing this impact. We extend the canonical rational addiction model by introducing a multidimensional framework of addiction, which allows for the decomposition of addiction in the context of soda consumption into two distinct components: caffeine and sugar. Using the parameter estimates, we conduct counterfactual analyses based on realistic policy scenarios and evaluate how different tax policies would affect soda purchases. For example, one policy experiment indicates that a tax of one cent per ounce only on sugary soda categories would lead to a 50.2% decrease in sugary soda consumption. In addition, we find that sugar seems to play a bigger role in influencing substitution patterns than caffeine. We further investigate how these taxes affect welfare through a change in addiction level and emphasize the importance of addiction by comparing estimation results with and without addiction in the model. To understand the externalities associated with soda taxation, we integrate our counterfactual results with causal estimates from recent medical literature. Our findings suggest that individuals could decrease their medical costs by $642 to $717 per year under various tax schemes. These results underscore the potential of soda taxes to significantly improve public health and reduce obesity-related healthcare costs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by a Nanyang Technological University start-up grant [Grant 023220-00001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02422 .</content>

    <title>Dynamic Pricing for Two-Sided Marketplaces with Offer Expiration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a two-sided marketplace in which a market operator sells services to clients and buys services from vendors. The market operator determines the prices dynamically for both clients and vendors. Services are transacted in discrete units called jobs, and the jobs are characterized by their types, service deadlines, client prices, and vendor prices. Jobs are submitted by clients to the marketplace, and the market operator then lists the available jobs. Vendors can view the available jobs and choose them based on their preferences. We consider an infinite-horizon long-run average reward Markov decision process (MDP) model of the market operator’s dynamic pricing problem. The MDP consists of the arrival processes on both sides of the marketplace as well as the choice behavior of both clients and vendors. Because solving this MDP directly is impractical for large market sizes, we study a discrete-time fluid approximation of the problem. This approximation results in a simple pricing policy in which each job’s price trajectory depends on the time remaining until the service deadline but does not depend on the other jobs available in the marketplace. We show that this policy is asymptotically optimal with a loss ratio of order [Formula: see text] on the long-run average reward, where [Formula: see text] represents the scale of demand and supply. The performance of the fixed price trajectory policy is compared with other heuristics, including a constant pricing policy and a state-dependent pricing policy. We also extend the model to continuous-time and finite-horizon settings.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: The work of Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To address growing geographical disparities in healthcare access and quality, connected health platforms (CHPs) have emerged as promising solutions. However, rapidly scaling CHPs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing tensions among multiple entities. This study examines the digital scaling process of a CHP through the lens of paradox theory, focusing on tensions and their management in resource‐constrained environments. We conducted a 13‐year longitudinal case study of a CHP encompassing over 300 hospitals in China. Our findings reveal three distinct yet interconnected phases of digital scaling: digital foundation building; system integration and governance; and continuous improvement and innovation. We demonstrate that tensions evolve over time during the scaling process, with one dominant type prevailing in each phase, challenging previous assumptions that different tensions emerge simultaneously across multiple entities. We also identify phase‐specific “both‐and” responses employed by rural hospitals to manage tensions despite experiencing resource constraints. We provide guidance to organizations operating in resource‐constrained environments on the management of paradoxical tensions across a complex digital scaling process.</content>

Relative to the 1990s, this share has both risen by 10% and become age‐dependent. The Pension Protection Act (PPA)—which allowed target date funds (TDFs) to be default options in retirement plans—played an important role: younger (older) workers starting at a firm after TDFs became the default option post‐PPA invested more (less) in stocks, in line with the TDF glidepath. In contrast, contribution rates changed little following the PPA.</content>

    <title>Do Shared Auditors Facilitate Follow‐on Innovation?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether shared auditors promote the dissemination of innovative knowledge among their clients, thereby fostering follow‐on innovation. We find that a company cites more patents from another company when they are audited by the same audit office. To address concerns about potential confounding factors stemming from commonalities in the fundamentals of the two companies, we leverage a quasi‐exogenous shock to auditor sharing: the demise of Arthur Andersen and the subsequent increase in auditor switching in 2002. Further analysis reveals that the effect of a shared auditor on cross‐client patent citations is stronger when both clients engage in intensive innovation activities. Additional evidence suggests that shared auditors exert more influence on the citations of recent patents and patents that are easier for outsiders to utilize. Overall, our findings suggest that auditors affect corporate innovation by facilitating the transfer of innovative knowledge among their clients.</content>

    <title>That's Not What I Was Promised! Psychological Contracts and Quiet Quitting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The phrase “quiet quitting” has become a popular topic within the workplace and academia. However, the nomological network of quiet quitting is unclear. We contribute to quiet quitting research by incorporating organizational justice and job characteristics theories with a psychological contract and social exchange lens to illuminate antecedents and outcomes of quiet quitting. Prior to doing so, we address the conceptual and measurement challenges that threaten the knowledge accumulation of quiet quitting research. Using a qualitative study (N= 42) and prior research, we disentangle quiet quitting from its antecedents and outcomes to define it asintentionally performing to the minimum requirements of the job. We then develop a measure of quiet quitting across a subject matter expert review (N= 51), a naïve rater review (N= 90), and an assessment of the measure's psychometric properties (N= 198). Finally, we assess our conceptual model (N= 540) and find that psychological contract fulfillment has a negative indirect effect on quiet quitting through job satisfaction. Furthermore, psychological contract breach increases quiet quitting through job satisfaction. We find that quiet quitting subsequently increases CWBs and decreases OCBs. Our findings point toward an optimistic outlook: by accurately communicating expectations regarding organizational justice and job characteristics, human resource managers may be able to limit the prevalence of quiet quitting and subsequent detrimental behaviors within their organizations.</content>

If advisors’ recommendations in the initial meeting led to positive (vs. negative) performance, investors are 2.1 times more likely to arrange a second meeting. This effect is driven by the performance of the recommendations the investor decided to follow. Investors with positive performance follow recommendations to a greater degree. The findings show that experiences matter in the advisory context and shape the demand for advice. (JEL D14; G11; G40; G51)</content>

    <title>Traditional Institutions in Modern Times: Dowries as Pensions When Sons Migrate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses newly-collected data on the allocation of dowry to examine its role in resolving intergenerational frictions around migration in India. Migration disrupts traditional elderly support structures, in which sons live near their parents and care for them in old age. We develop a model in which dowry can promote migration by allowing sons to make upfront transfers to their parents and ease constraints on income sharing. To test this hypothesis, we collect two new datasets that measure the distribution of dowry between family members. We document for the first time that net transfers of dowry to a man’s parents are common but far from universal. Consistent with using dowry for income sharing, such transfers occur more often when sons migrate, especially when they work in higher-earning occupations. In nationally representative data, migration rates are higher in areas with stronger historical dowry traditions. Finally, exploiting a large-scale highway construction program, we show that men from areas with stronger historical dowry traditions migrate more when migration costs fall. Our findings provide some clues as to why dowry persists despite its well-documented adverse consequences.</content>

    <title>Aggregation and the Estimation of Quality Change: Application to U.S. Import Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the contribution of changes in quality, price, and variety entry/exit to the aggregate price index for smooth, invertible demand systems, generalizing the standard results derived in the CES case. The results require the knowledge of heterogeneous cross-product elasticities of substitution. To apply them in practice, we also show how to identify rich demand systems using data only on prices and market shares, without the need for external cost-shock instruments or strong assumptions on the covariance between supply and demand shocks. Using this approach, we compute the US import price index based on the Kimball demand system. We find that quality change on average lowered the inflation in import prices by around 0.007 log points annually (1989–2016). To further validate our approach, we show that it estimates price elasticities and quality changes similar to those found by the standard mixed logit (BLP) demand in data on the US auto market.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impacts of Strategic Consumers and Direct Channel on Supply Chain Contracting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impacts of strategic consumers and direct channel on the manufacturer’s choice between static and dynamic contracts. We consider two scenarios: one in which the manufacturer sells through a single retailer, and the other in which it sells through two different retailers sequentially. In each scenario, the retailer(s) sets the retail prices, which the manufacturer’s direct channel matches, while consumers may time their purchases. We derive the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We find that in the first scenario, the static wholesale contract is preferred if the market share of the direct channel is large, as it alleviates strategic consumer waiting. This is most effective when consumers are moderately strategic. In the second scenario, intertemporal competition arises between the two retailers, which may not only reduce supply chain friction but also counteract strategic waiting. As a result, the equilibrium changes structurally. The dynamic wholesale contract is preferred when consumers are not very strategic, and the direct channel no longer plays a significant role. Several extensions of our main setting are explored. Our findings provide practical insights into how an upstream firm can effectively manage its retail channel in the presence of a direct channel and strategic consumers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Influence of Power on Trust in Buyer−Supplier Relationships: An Actor−Partner Interdependence Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trust is among the most critical factors in buyer−supplier relationships. In an effort to understand the origins of trust, power has become the focus of a burgeoning body of literature. However, research on the association between power and trust has been plagued by inconsistencies in terms of whose power and trust are being examined, which has led to confusion and hindered cumulative progress. We address this issue by disentangling the effect of the focal organization (actor effect) from the effect specific to its partner (partner effect) and accounting for both simultaneously. We further theorize and show that the partner’s level of self-promotion communication about his or her own achievements and credentials moderates both actor and partner effects, thus adding knowledge about a contingency that accounts for a considerable degree of variation in the linkage between power and trust. Using multi-informant, dyadic survey data paired with archival information scraped from firms’ webpages, we find that (i) actors low (vs. high) in power tend to place more trust (ii) while simultaneously eliciting higher levels of trust from their partners; however, (iii) these effects differ markedly depending on the partner’s level of self-promotion communication. Our study offers a novel, integrative perspective on power and trust, and we elaborate on its important implications for understanding buyer−supplier relationships.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Growth of a Two-Sided Platform with Heterogeneous Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the dynamics of a two-sided platform, where the agent population on both sides experiences growth over time with heterogeneous growth rates. The compatibility between buyers and sellers is captured by a bipartite network. The platform sets commissions to optimize its total profit overTperiods, considering the trade-off between short-term profit and growth as well as the spatial imbalances in supply and demand. We design an asymptotically optimal policy with the profit loss upper-bounded by a constant independent ofT, in contrast with a myopic policy shown to be arbitrarily bad. To derive the policy, we first develop a benchmark problem that captures the platform’s optimal steady state. We then identify the agent types with the lowest relative population ratio compared to the benchmark in each period, and adjust the service level of these types to be higher than or equal to their service level in the benchmark problem. A higher service level accelerates growth but requires substantial subsidies during the growth phase. Additionally, we provide the conditions under which the subsidy is necessary. We further examine the impact of the growth potential and the compatibility network structure on the platform’s optimal profit, the agents’ payment/income, and the optimal commissions at the optimal steady state. To achieve that, we introduce innovative metrics to quantify the long-run growth potential of each agent type. Using these metrics, we show that a “balanced” compatibility network, where the relative long-run growth potential between sellers and buyers for all submarkets is the same as that for the entire market, allows the platform to achieve maximum profitability. Our study provides insight into how the growth potential and compatibility network structure jointly influence the commission policy in the growth process and the optimal steady state.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether individuals form extrapolative beliefs across different tasks. In line with cross-extrapolation, equity analysts who experience bad news from some of their coverage firms become overly pessimistic about other firms in their coverage. This leads to disagreement among analysts and has implications for the stock market, as we observe effects on trading volume, return volatility, and pricing. Our findings highlight the relevance of non-domain-specific belief models.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04903 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how access to debt markets affects firms’ incentives to provide trade credit. Using hand-collected trade credit data between customer-supplier pairs and two exogenous shocks to firms’ debt capacity, we show that better access to debt reduces firms’ provision of trade credit per dollar of sales. The decline in trade credit is concentrated on ex ante powerful customers, but absent for weak ones, suggesting that better access to debt improves firms’ bargaining position relative to powerful customers. The decline in trade credit leads customers to cut investment, increase leverage, and scale back trade credit provision to firms further downstream.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04090 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dice: Advancing Social Media Research through Digital In-Context Experiments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article introduces Digital In-Context Experiments (DICE), an experimental paradigm that enables researchers to study entire social media feeds while tracking users’ granular behavioral data at the post level. Current research paradigms (vignette-based experiments, online platform studies, and observational studies) predominantly focus on isolated social media posts without examining how users consume content within the broader context of a feed. This isolation overlooks the competing attention between content (e.g., sponsored posts or ads) within a feed and contextual spillovers that occur when users scroll through continuous streams of content. DICE complements existing paradigms by presenting posts withinscrollable feeds, more closely resembling how users experience content on social media. This allows researchers to systematically manipulate entire feed compositions while unobtrusively tracking participants’ scrolling behavior. To demonstrate the potential of DICE, the article presents two illustrative case studies that examine contextual spillovers and predict ad recall in environments where content competes for attention. The authors conclude with directions for future research and managerial perspectives derived from expert interviews with marketing professionals. An accompanying open-source app, available athttps://dice-app.org, enables researchers to conveniently integrate the experimental paradigm into their preferred workflow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Article Title: “The ITEM Ontology: A Tool to Elucidate the Anatomy of Psychometric Indicators”Authors:Kai R. Larsen, University of Colorado BoulderRoland M. Mueller, Berlin School of Economics and LawDario Bonaretti, NEOMA Business SchoolDiana Fischer-Preßler, University of Applied Sciences FrankfurtJames (Jim) Burleson, California Polytechnic State UniversityNimisha Singh, Bennett University, IndiaJeffrey Parsons, Memorial University of NewfoundlandJean-Charles Pillet, Toulouse Business SchoolLan Sang, University of Colorado BoulderZhu (Drew) Zhang, University of Rhode IslandProblem definition:For decades, scientists have treated the survey item as the atomic unit of psychological measurement, an indivisible entity to be validated primarily through statistics. But what if we have been looking at the wrong level of analysis? Despite sophisticated modeling techniques, even well-validated instruments often contain items that are vague, double-barreled, or semantically misaligned with their intended constructs. These flaws remain undetected because current methods ignore the semantic anatomy of items. There is no shared language for decomposing indicators into the elements that carry meaning.Relevance:We show that psychometric measurement cannot be understood at the item or construct level and, for the first time, demonstrate that problems such as double-barreled items, restriction of range, and double negation can now be operationally defined and automatically detected. We argue that without tools like the ITEM Ontology, psychological measurement will never be precise enough to match the precision required for tasks such as medication optimization, leadership evaluation, technology impact assessment, and political polling.Theoretical foundations: This paper advances a new theory of survey indicator design by proposing that indicators can—and should—be deconstructed into meaningful components such as objects, actions, attributes, qualifiers, and response formats. This component-level analysis reveals structural and semantic flaws that traditional psychometric techniques often miss. Although grounded in linguistic and cognitive theory, our framework also draws on principles from established ontologies, particularly DOLCE, to ensure conceptual rigor and consistency. By making the internal anatomy of indicators explicit, the approach offers a foundational shift in how we understand, evaluate, and improve survey-based measurement.Methodology: We used design science methodologies to develop, refine, and test the ontology.Results: In addition to the ITEM ontology, we also provide a website ( http://www.itemontology.org/ ) that enables researchers to code indicators within the ontology, along with the ITEMIZER tool, which highlights potential wording issues and construct validity concerns associated with coded indicators.Contributions: This paper enables researchers and survey writers to understand the underlying components and their relationships within and across survey indicators. With the ITEM ontology, not only can we enhance the quality of future surveys, but we also provide a language to discuss how indicators are written and how they can be improved. We demonstrate the value of the ITEM Ontology by presenting two use cases for evaluating item quality and validating content.Keywords: ontology, psychometrics, indicator evaluation, validity, scale developmentProblem definition: What is your research problem/question in simple terms?Relevance: Why is this problem relevant for research and/or practice?Theoretical foundations: What theory (theories) underlie this work (if applicable)?Methodology: What is the research approach used (if applicable)?

    <title>Is Everyone Having a Good Time? The Effects of Complex Organizational Rituals on Employee Engagement and Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The organizational rituals literature has primarily focused on simple rituals and their positive effects on participants. While generative, this focus has obscured the intricacy and potential downsides of complex rituals, such as workplace celebrations and team-building retreats. In our research, we leverage Interaction Rituals Theory (IRT) to broaden the theoretical foundation of the study of organizational rituals by examining the range of experiences that employees have within complex organizational rituals. First, we inductively identify the positive and negative experiences within complex organizational rituals and create scales to measure them. Next, drawing further from IRT, we develop a model explaining how these experiences affect employee engagement and identify the subsequent work behaviors most likely to be affected by ritual-induced changes in engagement (helping, loyal boosterism, and job search behavior). In two field studies in the United States and Germany, we test this model, first in a single complex organizational ritual (i.e., company holiday party) and then across a broader set of common complex organizational rituals. Across both studies, we find that employees’ positive experiences during an organizational ritual enhance engagement and predict subsequent work behavior, while their effects can be significantly diminished by negative ritual experiences, challenging the assumption that rituals are uniformly beneficial. By providing evidence for a more balanced perspective on the impact of organizational rituals, our work provides a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the true nature of organizational rituals.</content>

    <title>When Managers Stay, Workers Are Safer: Rethinking the Value of Firm-Specific Human Capital</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A commonly held assumption is that firm-specific human capital benefits firms while constraining employees, particularly by reducing their external mobility. While this tension holds in many contexts, it overlooks the possibility that firm-specific human capital developed by one group of employees—managers—can generate positive externalities for others. Using a novel empirical setting and a 16-year panel of 19,044 establishments with 107,309 establishment-year observations, we find that an increase in managers’ firm-specific human capital is associated with improvements in workplace safety. These effects are especially pronounced in organizations with weak safety orientations and with higher proportions of lower-skill employees, who are typically more vulnerable to safety risks. Our findings reveal a previously underexplored channel through which firm-specific human capital creates value: by enabling managers to protect other employees. This challenges the prevailing view that firm-specific human capital primarily serves firm interests and highlights a broader set of beneficiaries—offering a new perspective on the role of managers’ firm-specific human capital in shaping organizational outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A crisis is a juncture that demands decision and action. We live in times of wicked crises, that is, crises that are non-linearly interlinked; transgress organizational, institutional, and cultural boundaries; and can be addressed only collectively. Our chances to rise to wicked crises depend on our capacity to decide and to act in concert, which is power, according to political philosopher Hannah Arendt. In this essay, in honor ofAdministrative Science Quarterly’s 70th volume, I highlight different features of wicked crises and discuss two interrelated forces that weaken and undermine such power: first, organizational fragmentation, which results in governance complexity and fault lines, and second, societal fragmentation, which manifests in growing distrust in core cultural institutions, polarization, the loss of a shared lifeworld, and the rise of authoritarianism. I conclude with a call to action for our discipline.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs who face recurring crises must repeatedly navigate lengthy recovery processes. In this article, we go beyond immediate responses and individual-level outcomes to focus on the evolution of entrepreneurial perseverance as entrepreneurs engage with broader recovery efforts post-crisis. We examined the experiences of 33 entrepreneurs during and following the Calbuco Volcano eruptions in Chile from 2015 to 2019. We discovered three social cues that reinforce entrepreneurial perseverance over extended periods of time: descriptive (the sharing of recovery memories), injunctive (the socialization of recovery work ethic), and symbolic (the celebration of recovery legacies). Findings show how socially reinforced entrepreneurial perseverance becomes intertwined with broader recovery efforts creating a sustained collective response to crisis, which we theorize asrelational entrepreneurial perseverancein extreme contexts. This changes our understanding of long-term entrepreneurial perseverance. Perseverance resides not simply in the individual entrepreneur but in social reinforcement, social support, and the capacity for connection, that is, the connection between individual actions, group principles, and community celebration. These create entrepreneurial recovery legacies that act as memory assets to be used when the next crisis hits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some firms pursue open design activities, that is, they freely share innovation-related knowledge with the outside world instead of keeping it secret or protected via patents. Through a series of lab and field studies, this research examines consumer beliefs and reactions to firms’ open design activities and documents a positiveopen design effect: presenting a product as open design (vs. not) increases its attractiveness to consumers. This effect emerges because consumers view firms that freely share innovation-related knowledge as providing benefits to society. Consistent with this societal benefits account, the effect is found to be stronger when (1) moral (vs. selfish) firm motives are made salient and (2) many (vs. few) other firms have already utilized the shared knowledge. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the effect is anchored in the notion that open design activities involve outflows of firm-internal (vs. inflows of firm-external) knowledge. By showing that consumers judge the way firms undertake innovation as more (vs. less) beneficial for society, this research extends the literatures on open design, open innovation, corporate social responsibility, and marketplace morality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the wide adoption of performance management by organizations, there is little evidence that performance management works. In this paper, I critique both the methods and the goals of performance management. First, I note that performance management, through its reliance on top‐down decision making, robs workers of autonomy and responsibility. Next, I note that two of the three major components of performance management (aligning job performance goals with the strategic goals of the organization and using frequent informal feedback to manage performance) are flawed, and that efforts to manage performance using these tools are likely to fail. Rather than relying on managing performance, organizations should follow decades of research on supportive leadership and focus on supporting and facilitating performance rather than managing it. I call for more empirical research to evaluate the effectiveness of performance management and the effects of the various tools used to manage performance.</content>

    <title>Cutting the apron strings: Establishing optimal distinctiveness from mentors in creative industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research has established that organizations benefit from “optimal distinctiveness,” that is, being sufficiently similar to and different from competitors. However, we know less about producers' strategic positioning choices to establish optimally distinctive identities. We explore this question through a qualitative study of chef‐owners who started their own restaurants after training with well‐known mentors. We identify two trajectories followed by chefs to establish optimal distinctiveness—legacy and divergent—and their components: interpersonal origins, strategic material and symbolic practices, tensions, and performance outcomes. Our study contributes to research by providing a more complete picture of how creative producers attempt to find an optimal balance between similarity to and difference from mentors, and the constraints they face in their strategic choices, including how these change over time.</content>

    <title>Reinvesting or Consuming Dividends: Account Structure Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is a long-standing fact that households mostly consume and rarely reinvest dividends. Among representative brokerage clients of one of Germany’s largest banks, we find the opposite: 80% reinvestments, 12% consumption. Of these reinvestments, the majority occurs with a delay after dividends are initially parked as brokerage cash. Motivated by this finding, we study payout modalities (deposits into brokerage accounts, checking accounts, or checks) as a novel mechanism that nudges investors towards reinvesting or consuming dividends. Consistent with a transition from checks to brokerage deposits, we find that the dividend consumption rate in the CEX has decreased substantially over time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act expands bank managers’ reporting requirements to federal agencies, particularly relating to banks’ financial losses should common market and macroeconomic shocks occur. To comply with this regulation, bank managers have engaged in consulting arrangements (referred to as regulatory consulting). We examine the financial reporting quality implications associated with hiring external auditors for these services. We find banks with auditor-provided regulatory consulting, relative to banks without, have higher financial reporting quality as measured by loan loss provision validity. Consistent with knowledge spillover benefits accruing to financial audit teams, we find more pronounced effects in the fourth versus interim quarters and more frequent income-reducing Y9-C restatements. We also find auditor responsiveness to PCAOB inspections improves the effectiveness of regulatory consulting. Overall, our results suggest regulatory consulting improves the audits of estimates in judgmental financial statement accounts, despite regulatory concerns that these services may impair auditor independence.</content>

    <title>Communication, Learning, and Bargaining Breakdown: An Empirical Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bargaining breakdown is common in bargaining in environments with incomplete information. We study whether, in these environments, permitting communication impacts bargaining outcomes. On May 23, 2016, eBay Germany’s Best Offer platform introduced unstructured communication allowing desktop users, but not mobile users, to accompany offers with a message. Using this natural experiment, our difference-in-differences approach documents a 14% decrease in the rate of breakdown among compliers. Though adoption is immediate, the effect is not. We show, using text analysis, that the dynamics are consistent with repeat players learning how to use communication in bargaining. Finally, tying the two results together, we show that messages that emulate the text content of experienced sellers are more likely to be accepted.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: Part of this research was supported by the NSF [Grant SES-1629060].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00366 .</content>

    <title>Pricing Control and Regulation on Online Service Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An open debate in platform design is who should control pricing: the platform (centralized pricing) or its service providers (decentralized pricing). We show that a key trade-off is between regulating competition and enabling price tailoring. Centralized pricing allows the platform to manage competition, but it faces information asymmetry as it cannot observe agent costs. Decentralized pricing lets agents adjust prices to their costs, but without oversight, competition can become too strong (prices too low) or too weak (prices too high). For commission-based platforms, either form of price control can prevail depending on market conditions, implying that neither dominates. However, a relatively simple tweak—adopting an affine fee structure based on posted prices or quantities served—allows the platform to decentralize pricing control without sacrificing optimality. This flexibility further supports agent classification as independent contractors, offering platforms a valuable strategic option for how to structure their workforce.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Supporting grants have been provided by the Mack Institute for Innovation Management and the Ripple University Blockchain Research Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04078 .</content>

    <title>A Modeling Framework for Tipping in the Presence of a Social Norm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tipping is a complex phenomenon cutting across various stakeholders—firms, customers, and workers. Analyzing the long-run impact of policies related to tipping is therefore challenging. To facilitate such analysis, we develop a modeling framework in which a tipping norm forms endogenously in a market consisting of a firm that offers service to potential customers. Customers choose whether to consume the service or not and, if yes, how much to tip the server afterward. With tipping, customers show appreciation to the server by sharing a fraction of their surplus but also undergo social pressure to comply with the prevailing norm. This tipping norm is shown to evolve endogenously through a dynamic process of sequential market adjustments over time: the average tip in each period determines the tipping norm for the following period, causing the firm to adapt the price and customers to adapt their tips accordingly. Characterization of this equilibrium outcome allows us to derive qualitative results on the long-run impact of different exogenous factors on tipping: we find that the equilibrium tip-to-price ratio increases when customers are more sensitive to social pressure, their range of service valuations spreads out, or they consider the service more valuable. Building on this framework, we further investigate several economic implications of tipping pertaining to social welfare, labor cost, and service quality, thus uncovering incentives and trade-offs to which the tipping mechanism gives rise from the firm, the worker, and the customer’s perspectives.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations and supply chain management.Funding: Financial support by The Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel, The Coller Foundation, and the Israeli Science Foundation [Grant 1361/23] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03422 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Words Meet Visuals: How Content Composition Drives Social Media Engagement for Marketer-Generated Content</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the balance between text and pictorial content in marketer-generated social media posts affect user engagement? The authors address this question by using computer vision and natural language processing tools to extract the visual and textual features of 34,610 organic brand posts from Facebook and Instagram. Using a Confounding-and-Cluster-Robust Causal Forests model, they test how the balance of text and picture affects social media engagement across content and visual contexts. Results show that posts with greater emphasis on overlay text over pictorial content tend to have fewer likes and comments. However, the performance of text-oriented posts improves if text is more centered, informative, emotionally positive, and congruent with the pictorial content, and if the picture contains fewer prominent objects or less information such as social cues. They quantify how incremental changes in such content composition affect social media engagement. These findings set forth evidence-based principles for optimizing text and picture balance in marketer-generated content (MGC) and provide actionable guidelines on whether, where, when, and how to present text on an image. This research highlights the potential for transforming content and media creation from an imprecise art form into an empirical science nested within a data-driven visual optimization framework.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Trajectory of Confidence: Experience, Certainty, and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Confidence has an important influence on consumer behavior. Beyond what consumers know or believe, the confidence with which they hold those things (i.e., how certain they feel) shapes their judgments, decisions, and actions. But how does confidence shift as consumers gain experience? And what are the consequences for consumer choice? A multimethod investigation combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and experiments to examine these questions. Analysis of 3.7 million reviews from almost 100,000 consumers spanning nearly 30 years reveals a common confidence trajectory. Across diverse product categories (e.g., wine, beer, and cosmetics) there is a U-shaped relationship between experience and confidence. While gaining initial experience decreases confidence, eventually, with more experience, confidence rebounds. Further, feeling less confident leads consumers to avoid options associated with uncertainty and choose something different. This includes picking different products, avoiding brands associated with the uncertainty, and waiting longer to choose from those brands again. Taken together, this research sheds light on the evolution of confidence, how uncertainty shapes choice, and drivers of product switching and brand loyalty more generally.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of an MBA‐style executive education course in finance on corporate policies and firm performance targeting top managers of medium and large Mozambican enterprises. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the educational treatment induces changes in financial policies that improve firm performance. Specifically, a reduction in working capital (0.4 to 0.5 standard deviations) increases cash flow, and in turn long‐term investments. This effect operates primarily through a reduction in accounts receivable (0.4 to 1 standard deviations). Our findings show that targeted educational interventions can build managerial capital and enhance corporate performance by improving financial decision making among executives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of the U.S. money market fund reform implemented in October 2016 on global banks' funding supply and business activities. We show that the reform induced a large negative wholesale funding shock for global banks. In contrast to the conventional bank lending channel, the primary response of global banks to the reform was a cutback in arbitrage positions that relied on unsecured funding, rather than a reduction in loan provision. We discuss the role of postcrisis liquidity regulations and unconventional monetary policy in explaining our findings, and implications for banks' business models and deposit competition.</content>

    <title>Toward Artificial Intelligence Compliance: Impacts and Mechanisms of Performance Feedback</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance performance, ensuring that employees use AI in compliance with organizational policies becomes crucial for realizing its full value. However, employees’ AI compliance is not guaranteed and can vary based on how their AI use is managed. This study offers timely and actionable insights into how performance feedback—both positive and negative—influences employees’ AI compliance, and how these effects vary with AI identity. Drawing on feedback intervention theory, we conduct a longitudinal field study and a randomized experiment and find that positive performance feedback promotes AI compliance, whereas negative performance feedback reduces it. Importantly, employees with high AI identity respond more strongly to both types of performance feedback. Our findings further uncover distinct underlying mechanisms—task-motivation, task-learning, and meta-cognitive processes—that channel the effects of positive and negative performance feedback on AI compliance. Taken together, organizations should tailor performance feedback as part of AI governance by considering employees’ AI identity. Positive reinforcement of AI compliance is especially effective for employees with high AI identity, whereas cautions are needed when delivering negative performance feedback to avoid undermining AI compliance. Policy guidelines should support identity-sensitive performance feedback in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper makes the first comprehensive attempt to study within‐country heterogeneity of housing returns. We introduce a new city‐level data set covering 15 OECD countries over 150 years and show that national housing markets are characterized by systematic spatial variation in housing returns. Total returns in large agglomerations are close to 100 basis points lower per year than in other parts of the same country. Excess returns outside the large cities can be rationalized as compensation for higher risk, especially higher covariance with income growth and lower liquidity. Real estate in diversified large agglomerations is comparatively safe.</content>

    <title>Decoupling Firm Growth From Carbon Emissions: A Supply Network Role Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To achieve meaningful progress in carbon neutrality, absolute carbon emissions must be reduced. One possible approach is to decouple firms' growth trajectories from their emissions. Adopting a supply network perspective, this study examines how firms in different network roles decouple their growth from carbon emissions across all scopes. Focusing on the aerospace and defense industry's supply network, we apply an ego‐temporal exponential random graph model (ego‐TERGM) to empirically infer four previously conceptualized firm roles—negotiator, orchestrator, executor, and compromiser—based on structural and nodal characteristics. The findings of our exploratory analysis reveal significant differences in decoupling performance: the firms in roles characterized by denser ego networks decouple more effectively, while those in roles characterized by central and monopolistic positions tend to perform worse. These differences reflect the influence of power dynamics and network dependencies on firms' decoupling abilities. Central firms must navigate complex demands, while those in denser network roles experience stronger normative pressures to conform to sustainable practices. Beyond these network effects, decoupling can be further supported by setting more ambitious emissions targets, adopting moderate growth strategies, and prioritizing environmental innovation.</content>

    <title>Developing Generative AI for Value Co‐Creation: An Intervention‐Based Randomized Field Experiment in a Healthcare Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Owing to limited healthcare resources, there has been increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) interventions to treat mental health problems of chronic disease patients in developing countries. However, it is challenging to overcome the AI trust crisis in the healthcare context and develop AI that improves the patient's personalized experience and the quality of care. Elaborating on the value co‐creation theory using an actor–network theory (ANT) approach, this study examines how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can improve post‐discharge care for patients with cardiovascular disease in resource‐limited settings. Using an intervention‐based research approach in collaboration with a major hospital in China, researchers co‐designed a GenAI intervention with potential users and various stakeholders. Through a randomized controlled trial, we further evaluated the impact of a co‐created GenAI intervention on the post‐discharge self‐confidence and quality of care of 114 patients. Compared with the standard post‐discharge care process, chronically ill patients who received the GenAI intervention experienced a 6.049‐point (out of a total of 80 points) decrease in state anxiety and an 87.8% decrease in the 30‐day readmission risk. The insights gained from the intervention process, as interpreted using the ANT approach, expand the generic framework of value co‐creation to include a more GenAI‐mediated network of human and non‐human objects. Results reveal GenAI's boundary‐spanning and integrating roles as a critical node in the emerging, dynamic, value‐creating actor network. The inclusion of “a nonparticipant observe” allows us to offer cognitive explanations for why GenAI works. Overall, this study contributes to healthcare operations management by designing a process for developing and implementing GenAI to improve healthcare operations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using property rights theory to examine the characteristics that enable family firms to exclude rivals from their competitive space, we explain why the family form of governance is often selected instead of the nonfamily form of governance and what determines the scale and scope of family firms. Family-centered nonpecuniary goals allow family firms to capture rights to common property opportunities that nonfamily firms find unattractive. Furthermore, the development and deployment of non-tradeable, immobile, inimitable, and indivisible human and nonhuman resources enable family firms to protect their property rights from competitors. Finally, because family members act as owners and managers, family firm governance can reduce the cost of monitoring as well as the possibility of opportunistic behavior and underinvestment of family resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the establishment of public audit oversight bodies (POBs) worldwide. We present descriptive evidence on POBs’ characteristics and factors influencing the timing of their establishment, finding that countries with stronger institutions, civil law traditions, and higher media attention to audit quality adopt POBs faster. While countries may choose similar POB design features, these choices do not align with the factors driving adoption speed. We also explore whether the finding of a positive impact on audit quality of the U.S. PCAOB generalizes to other countries. A difference‐in‐differences analysis over 20 years provides some evidence that POB establishment and their characteristics improve audit quality. However, the results appear sensitive to audit quality measures and research design. Our study offers the first broad‐based investigation of POB adoption and provides important nuance on the relation between POBs and audit quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial clusters are an important driver of economic growth, but regions with comparable resource profiles do not necessarily produce similar clusters. We propose that religion may play an important role in the spatial arrangement of industries and can explain why regions with similar resources do not produce similar clusters. We advance a theory predicting a suppressive effect of religion on the development of industrial clusters in morally controversial industries. We argue that in such industries, regions dominated by denominations that treat controversial industries as immoral will experience lower firm entry rates, compared to regions with a lower presence of such denominations. We theorize about three underlying processes. First, in regions dominated by religious groups opposing a controversial industry, negative attitudes of religious actors generate social environments unfavorable to businesses in this industry. Second, there could be an ecological effect of religion wherein the suppressive impact of a focal region’s oppositional religiosity is mitigated when neighboring regions have higher oppositional religiosity than that of the focal region. Finally, in regions with high oppositional religiosity, religious social movements are likely to emerge to target a controversial industry and its participants, which should further repel potential entrants. Our event-count analyses of biotherapeutics firm entry rates in U.S. metropolitan statistical areas from the industry’s beginning in 1976 through 2004 support our predictions.</content>

    <title>Insurance Versus Moral Hazard in Income-Contingent Student Loan Repayment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Student loans with income-contingent repayment insure borrowers against income risk but can reduce their incentives to earn more. Using a change in Australia’s income-contingent repayment schedule, I show that borrowers reduce their labor supply to lower their repayments. These responses are larger among borrowers with more hourly flexibility, a lower probability of repayment, and tighter liquidity constraints. I use these responses to estimate a dynamic model of labor supply with frictions that generate imperfect adjustment. My estimates imply that the labor supply responses to income-contingent repayment limit the optimal amount of insurance in government-provided student loans. However, these responses are too small to justify fixed repayment contracts: restructuring existing student loans from fixed repayment to a constrained-optimal income-contingent loan—while keeping the tax and transfer system unchanged—increases borrower welfare by the equivalent of a 0.8% increase in lifetime consumption at no additional fiscal cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a novel contextual bandit algorithm for personalized pricing under utility fairness constraints in scenarios with uncertain demand, achieving an optimal regret upper bound. Our approach, which incorporates dynamic pricing and demand learning, addresses the critical challenge of fairness in pricing strategies. We first delve into the static full-information setting to formulate an optimal pricing policy as a constrained optimization problem. Here, we propose an approximation algorithm for efficiently and approximately computing the ideal policy. We also use mathematical analysis and computational studies to characterize the structures of optimal contextual pricing policies subject to fairness constraints, deriving simplified policies that lay the foundations of more in-depth research and extensions. Further, we extend our study to dynamic pricing problems with demand learning, establishing a nonstandard regret lower bound that highlights the complexity added by fairness constraints. Our research offers a comprehensive analysis of the cost of fairness and its impact on the balance between utility and revenue maximization. This work represents a step toward integrating ethical considerations into algorithmic efficiency in data-driven dynamic pricing.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Effects of the 2021 Expanded Child Tax Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the impact of the 2021 Child Tax Credit (CTC) expansion using detailed transaction data from nearly two million individuals and difference-in-difference analyses around monthly CTC payments. We find that recipients significantly increase their consumption in the week following the payment versus the prior week, with more pronounced effects for lower-income recipients and those with more children. We also find a significant reduction in liquidity constraints for lower-income recipients, with reductions in overdrafts, use of high-interest payday loans, and use of gig work for supplemental income. Building on these initial findings, our analysis further delves into more nuanced, policy-targeted aspects: We observe a greater alleviation of liquidity constraints from monthly CTC payments compared with annual tax refunds. In addition, monthly payments decrease consumption volatility and increase stability in consumption levels. These results inform considerations for payment frequency. Furthermore, we provide insights into the income thresholds for the policy’s phase-in and phase-out ranges by identifying the most pronounced consumption effects among the lowest-income recipients—who benefit from full refundability under the plan—and noting an absence of significant consumption changes among higher-income recipients. Our results present the first large-scale, transaction-based, empirical archival evidence of the effects stemming from the 2021 CTC amendments and provide insights for policy-related discussions.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: We acknowledge funding from the Think Forward Initiative and the University of California, Irvine, and the U See I Write initiative at the University of California, Irvine, for focused writing retreats which facilitated the writing of this manuscript.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02254 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use arbitrage activity in equity, fixed income, and foreign exchange markets to characterize the frictions and constraints facing intermediaries. The average pairwise correlation between the 32 arbitrage spreads that we study is 22%. These low correlations are inconsistent with canonical intermediary asset pricing models. We show that at least two types of segmentation drive arbitrage dynamics. First, funding is segmented—certain trades rely on specific funding sources, making their arbitrage spreads sensitive to localized funding shocks. Second, balance sheets are segmented—intermediaries specialize in certain trades, so arbitrage spreads are sensitive to idiosyncratic balance‐sheet shocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sell‐side analysts commonly transition to buy‐side money managers. I examine whether and how these career transitions shape sell‐side analysts' behavior, relying on the granular career information of 6,310 analysts in the United States. I identify analysts who transition from the sell‐side to the buy‐side and find that these analysts issue inflated recommendations on stocks of interest to their future buy‐side employers. This favoritism is (1) present only during the year preceding their transition, (2) more pronounced among stocks where a single analyst is more influential in moving the stock price; and (3) present only among transitions likely to be strategically planned. Importantly, stocks receiving inflated recommendations experience a significant price decline following the departure of transitioning analysts from the sell‐side. Overall, these findings suggest that analyst career transitions are an important source of conflicts of interest.</content>

    <title>Stick together or break apart? Stigmatizing adverse events, media vilification, and unplanned alliance dissolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article advances the understanding of alliance instability by integrating organizational stigma and signaling theories to explain unplanned alliance dissolution after potentially stigmatizing adverse events. We highlight the media as a key intermediary influencing whether partners stick together or break apart. We also argue that firm status and external corporate governance serve as signals that key stakeholders interpret differently, that is, amplifying media vilification but mitigating the event's impact on partners' decision to dissolve the alliance. Using a sample of US passenger airlines from 1985 to 2016, our findings support the view that it takes more than a stigmatizing event to disrupt an alliance. By establishing boundaries for stigmatization effects and contextualizing firm‐specific signals, we offer a nuanced explanation of the mechanisms driving alliance instability.Managerial SummaryFirms inevitably face adverse events, from uncontrollable accidents to errors, resulting in severe consequences such as diminished valuation and damaged reputation. In such situations, executives of the firm affected by an adverse event must decide whether to rely on their alliance partners to stick with their firm or prepare for the eventuality that partners will run away. To address this question, we conducted a 31‐year study of 40 publicly traded US airline companies. Our findings underscore the impact of negative media coverage on unplanned alliance dissolution, surpassing the influence of event characteristics; they draw the attention of affected firms’ executives to the dual implications of their firms’ status and external corporate governance – a double‐edged sword that requires careful consideration.</content>

    <title>Self‐regulation, corruption, and competitiveness in extractive industries: Making transparency pay</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self‐regulation is often proposed as a substitute for government regulation. We examine a setting in which a subset of firms voluntarily committed to transparency standards despite immediate competitive disadvantages, not merely to preempt regulation but to succeed under future mandatory rules they helped enact through lobbying. Focusing on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an anti‐corruption multi‐stakeholder initiative, we show that firms initially incurred competitive costs in corrupt markets after endorsing EITI. These firms subsequently lobbied for mandatory disclosure regulations. Once mandatory rules took effect, previously disadvantaged transparent firms gained substantial competitive advantages. Our study highlights how firms can integrate voluntary commitment with political advocacy to resolve collective action problems, reshaping both competitive dynamics and the regulatory landscape.Managerial SummaryFirms frequently sign onto voluntary pro‐social or pro‐environmental initiatives to placate activists, avoid tougher regulation, or burnish reputations. We examine global oil and mining companies that backed the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), even though transparency commitments initially hurt their ability to win licenses in highly corrupt countries. Rather than stopping at voluntary disclosure, these firms aggressively campaigned for mandatory payment‐reporting laws that would level the competitive playing field. When governments eventually imposed those rules, early EITI supporters gained significant, sustained advantages. The study shows that combining voluntary transparency with targeted political advocacy lets companies steer regulation, convert short‐term costs into long‐term strategic gains, and address corruption.</content>

    <title>When mimicry leads to divergence: Interdependence asymmetries and selective imitation among competitors</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate why firms imitating the same competitor's strategy in the same environment often replicate different components of that strategy. We argue that such divergence can arise because firms vary in the internal interdependencies that underlie their strategies. When a firm significantly differs from a competitor in how one component of its strategy interacts with other components, the consequences of replicating the competitor's choices about that component are harder to anticipate, making imitation less likely. We discuss how imitators' internal coordination mechanisms may help mitigate barriers to imitation arising from interdependence asymmetries and test our resulting hypotheses in the context of esports, where small teams of professional video‐game players compete in high‐stakes tournaments.Managerial SummaryWe investigate why firms observing the same competitor often imitate different aspects of that competitor’s strategy. We argue that this variation stems from each firm’s unique internal connections between activities. When a competitor’s practice is closely linked to other parts of their strategy, imitation becomes riskier if similar links do not exist in the focal firm—making imitation less likely. Using data from esports teams, where both strategic choices and coordination are observable, we show that these differences can act as barriers to imitation. However, strong communication or shared experience among decision‐makers helps overcome such barriers. Our results may caution managers against indiscriminately copying “best practices”: the highly competitive teams we studied considered not only what competitors did, but also whether those practices fit their own processes and structures.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Assortment Optimization in the Presence of Focal Effect: Operational Insights and Efficient Algorithms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The assortment provided by the seller can influence customers’ evaluation of item utility. A possible consequence is that certain items in an assortment become “focal items” to customers, and customers over-evaluate their utilities. We refer to this phenomenon as thefocal effect. Kovach and Tserenjigmid (2022) recently propose a focal Luce model (FLM) to describe customers’ choices in the presence of the focal effect. The merit of the FLM lies in its flexibility to model different consumer psychology, which leads to varying choice behaviors. In this paper, we use the FLM to capture several scenarios where the focal effect occurs and consider the associated assortment optimization problems. In the first scenario, the focal effect arises from item ranking, and customers prefer items that appear at certain positions in the ranking. This scenario captures the case where customers have a preference for the cheapest items in the assortment, as well as the compromise effect. The second scenario describes the case where the focal effect exists on some predetermined items. An example of this scenario is choice overload, where customers are more likely to choose the no-purchase option when the assortment size is larger. We characterize the optimal assortment structure under each scenario and give the underlying operational insights. We find that the assortment optimization problems under these two scenarios can be solved in polynomial time with some practical assumptions. The polynomial-solvability extends even to the more challenging joint assortment and pricing optimization problems. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the FLM’s performance using both synthetic and real datasets. The results show that the FLM performs well in predicting customer choice behavior and the corresponding optimal assortment generates higher profit than benchmark assortments when the focal effect exists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Maximizing customer retention in multi-session training service: Model and algorithm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Training is an important business in the service sector. Usually, a training program involves multiple sessions and each session contains multiple activities. Although it is essential for customers to participate in all training sessions and activities, many customers fail to complete the program because the training experience is too stressful. Given the importance of customer retention in the training programs, we investigate the modeling and optimization of the retention-oriented training program design problem (RTDP), which maximizes overall service retention across all training sessions through activity scheduling. Customers make their participation decisions about their next training session based on the remembered holistic utility of past training activities. By our analysis, RTDP is a 0-1 constrained exponential sum problem (0-1 CESP), which we prove to be NP-hard. To resolve RTDP, we introduce a geometric branch and bound (GB&amp;B) algorithm that efficiently searches for the optimal solution by resolving a series of subproblems. From a numerical study, we find that higher reward, difficulty, and value lead to more U-shaped, inverted U-shaped, and increasing subsequences in each session, respectively. The reason is that higher reward favors sequences with a pleasant start and a sharp positive gradient toward the end, higher difficulty requires warm-up and cool-down, and higher value makes customers emphasize the end experience. Finally, we extend our research by investigating RTDP with session breaks and discussing the joint retention-performance optimization. When there are breaks between sessions, we find that as the break duration increases, the optimal value first increases and then decreases. For the joint retention-performance optimization, the optimal sequence is more pulsed if the service designer cares more about customer performance and flatter if the service designer cares more about customer retention.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dyadic Interactions and Patient Service Evaluation in Online Healthcare Consultations: The Role of Communication Alignment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of doctor–patient interactions on patients’ service evaluations in online medical consultations (OMCs) has received considerable attention. However, prior research has mainly focused on the individual-level and statistical features of these interactions, with limited exploration of dyad-level dynamics in doctor–patient bidirectional communication. To address this gap, this study examines both individual-level and dyad-level features of online doctor–patient interactions to understand their effects on patients’ service evaluations. We characterize doctors’ individual-level communication behaviors using the quantity and informativeness of doctors’ information acquisition and provision, and capture dyad-level features by quantifying communication alignment in doctor–patient dialogues using spectral analysis. We utilize patient gratitude as an indicator of patients’ service evaluation. Drawing on expectancy violations theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the direct and interaction effects of doctors’ communication behaviors and doctor–patient communication alignment on patient gratitude in OMCs. The model is empirically tested using a large dataset collected from a leading OMC platform in China. The analysis reveals three key findings. First, the informativeness of doctors’ information acquisition negatively affects patient gratitude, while neither the informativeness nor the quantity of information provision has a significant effect. Second, communication alignment positively influences patient gratitude. Third, communication alignment positively moderates the effects of the informativeness of both information acquisition and provision on patient gratitude. This study contributes to the literature on patients’ service evaluations, doctor–patient interactions, and communication alignment in online healthcare, and offers practical guidelines for enhancing the overall quality of online healthcare services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine traders’ order submission strategies during the Euronext preopen, which uses price-time priorities to arrange opening trades via a call auction. Preopening order submissions follow a J-shape pattern. Sophisticated proprietary traders arrive late, consistent with information leakage concerns. Slow clients arrive early and place aggressive orders to advertise their trading needs and strategically gain time priority. Their early order submissions often occur in stocks with an increase in the tick size and on days with expected liquidity shocks. They also contribute to daily price discovery. Using a preopening outage as a natural experiment, we show that the Euronext preopen improves price discovery on a rival venue. These benefits hold even in the absence of an opening auction taking place.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: Financial support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grants ANR-16-CE26-0008, ANR-17-EURE-0010 (Investissements d’Avenir program)].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03998 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the role of insurers in providing liquidity in the corporate bond market, especially during “rainy days” when the aggregate dealer inventory is positive for a relatively large fraction of the outstanding bonds. We find that, on average, life insurers have positive liquidity supply in the years following the 2007–2009 financial crisis, primarily driven by their buy-side transactions. Insurers’ corporate bond purchases improve the liquidity of transacted bonds and comparable bonds on rainy days. Using unusual weather-related losses realized in the affiliated property and casualty division as an instrumental variable, we show that corporate bonds purchased more by insurers have higher liquidity in subsequent periods.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02994 .</content>

    <title>A Tale of Two Networks: Common Ownership and Product Market Rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the welfare implications of the rise of common ownership in the United States from 1995 to 2021. We build a general equilibrium model with a hedonic demand system in which firms compete in a network game of oligopoly. Firms are connected through two large networks: the first reflects ownership overlap, the second product market rivalry. In our model, common ownership of competing firms induces unilateral incentives to soften competition and the magnitude of the common ownership effect depends on how much the two networks overlap. We estimate our model for the universe of U.S. public corporations using a combination of firm financials, investor holdings, and text-based product similarity data. We perform counterfactual calculations to evaluate how the efficiency and the distributional impact of common ownership have evolved over time. Under the assumption that firms maximize a share-weighted average of their shareholders' income, we find that the welfare cost of common ownership, measured as the ratio of deadweight loss to total surplus, has increased about ninefold between 1995 and 2021. Under alternative assumptions about corporate governance, the deadweight loss of common ownership ranges between 3.5% and 13.2% of total surplus in 2021. The rise of common ownership has also led to a significant reallocation of surplus from consumers to producers.</content>

    <title>Where to Invest in Resilience in a Facility Network?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Much of the previous research on facility networks focuses on improving the network design, but a good design alone is not sufficient to ensure smooth operations against disruption risks. This study examines an underexplored question ofwhereto invest in resilience in a facility network. Prior studies offered insights into this issue, with some scholars recommending a focus oncritical nodes, while others emphasize the importance ofcritical pathsthat are sequences of adjacent nodes and edges. Yet the node and path perspectives have not been fully integrated and optimized for facility networks. Motivated by real problems from Cainiao Network, this study reconciles the debate over node versus path and solves the problem of resilience investment to maximize expected max-flow through the network. The analysis reveals that investing in high-capacity nodes is optimal under rare disruptions, whereas investing in nodes on entire paths is best under frequent disruptions. The problem of resilience investment is in general NP-hard, but we propose greedy algorithms inspired by the node and path perspectives to provide approximate solutions with performance guarantees. Empirical analysis using operational data from Cainiao Network supports our analytical findings.</content>

    <title>Blinded versus Unblinded Review: A Field Study on the Equity of Peer-Review Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to inequities in merit-based evaluations. We tested this claim in a high-stakes field experiment comparing single-blind review (reviewer identities withheld) and double-blind review (reviewer and author identities withheld) for 530 academic conference submissions. On reliability, both processes showed moderate reliability, leading to only 40% overlap among top-rated submissions. This low overlap indicates that differences between review systems partly stem from noise in the review system. In terms of fairness, our analysis indicates that single-blind reviews favored more senior coauthors and first authors who were PhD students or research scientists while disfavoring Asian (versus White) first authors. Meanwhile, male first authors received slightly higher ratings in both conditions (especially under double-blind), but the greater the proportion of male coauthors, the lower the review ratings were under double-blind (versus single-blind). On validity, we find that for submissions accepted and presented as a talk, neither review ratings nor author characteristics predicted talk quality, number of questions, or attendance. However, review ratings from both systems similarly predicted judged poster presentation quality (for a subset of submissions) and eventual publication (for all submissions). These findings highlight limitations in both single- and double-blind approaches. Double-blind review is not a cure-all for inequities that might arise via single-blind. Yet, including author identities does not appear to enhance reliability or validity enough to justify the risks this information poses in potentially advantaging a particular individual or group.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and data analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SBE 1824259].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01646 .</content>

    <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for Human-Guided Human-Machine Interaction with Private Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the human-machine interaction such as recommending videos for improving customer engagement, we study human-guided human-machine interaction for decision making with private information. We model this interaction as a two-player turn-based game, where one player (Bob, a human) guides the other player (Alice, a machine) toward a common goal. Specifically, we focus on offline reinforcement learning (RL) in this game, where the goal is to find a policy pair for Alice and Bob that maximizes their expected total rewards based on an offline data set collected a priori. The offline setting presents two challenges: (i) We cannot collect Bob’s private information, leading to a confounding bias when using standard RL methods, and (ii) there is a distributional mismatch between the behavior policy used to collect data and the desired optimal policy we aim to learn. To tackle the confounding bias, we treat Bob’s previous action as an instrumental variable for Alice’s current decision making to adjust for the unmeasured confounding. We establish a novel identification result and propose a new off-policy evaluation (OPE) method for evaluating policy pairs in this two-player turn-based game. To tackle the distributional mismatch, we leverage the idea of pessimism and use our OPE method to develop an off-policy policy learning algorithm for finding a desirable policy pair for both Alice and Bob. Moreover, we prove that under some technical assumptions, the policy pair obtained through our method converges to the optimal one at a satisfactory rate. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: L.

    <title>Income Pools for Superstar Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Superstar” markets, where a small portion of individuals earn disproportionately high incomes, are common in fields like entrepreneurship, sports, and entertainment. Participants in these markets face significant income uncertainty, which can deter entry or prompt early exit. To address this difficulty, we propose income pools: contracts where individuals agree to share a portion of future earnings with pool members if a specific salary milestone is achieved. To date, hundreds of income pool contracts have been signed in practice. This paper develops the first mathematical model to analyze such contracts, focusing on stability (i.e., pools where no agents leave or join). When constrained to creating a single pool, we show that a stable pool always exists with specific structural properties. Generally, stronger agents tend to be more “collaborative” and favor larger pools, whereas weaker agents are more “selfish” and prefer smaller pools. Next, we analyze pools that adhere to a maximum size (mirroring current practice) and show that stability persists. These pools typically require more weaker agents than strong ones and we find an interesting “Pareto dominance” result, whereby all agents in a stable pool prefer a particular unique stable pool. Finally, we study general partition structures, prove that a stable partition always exists under certain conditions, and provide an algorithm to construct such a partition. We conclude with a case study on data from 2,000 professional baseball players to demonstrate a 20%–30% increase in social welfare if players join income pools, under varying contract parameters.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: T.

    <title>The Benefits of Delay to Online Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Real-time decisions are usually irrevocable in many contexts of online decision making. One common practice is delaying real-time decisions so that the decision maker can gather more information to make better decisions. For example, in online retailing, there is typically a time delay between when an online order is received and when it gets picked and assembled for shipping. However, decisions cannot be delayed forever. In this paper, we study this fundamental trade-off and aim to theoretically characterize the benefits of delaying real-time decisions. We provide a theoretical foundation for a broad family of online decision-making problems by proving that the gap between our proposed online algorithm (called “delayed Bayesian prophet”) and the offline optimal hindsight policy decays exponentially fast in the length of delay. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments on the benefits of delay, using both synthetic data and publicly available real data. Both our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate an important managerial insight: a little delay is all we need. Finally, we extend our analysis and results to the setting where the arrival distribution is independent but nonidentical, the setting where the arrival distribution is unknown, and the setting where decisions are made in batches.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The second author was partially funded by a grant from Amazon.com Inc., awarded through collaboration with the Columbia Center of AI Technology.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00549 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The positive role of transformational leadership for productivity and mental well-being has long been established. Transformational leadership behavior may be particularly suited to navigate times of crisis that are characterized by high levels of complexity and uncertainty. We exploit quasi-random assignment of employees to managers and study the role of frontline managers’ leadership styles on employees’ performance, work style, and mental well-being in times of crisis. Using longitudinal administrative data and panel survey data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that the benefits of different leadership styles depend on the environment: Employees of more transactional managers outperform those of more transformational leaders before the onset of the pandemic. During the pandemic, however, more transformational managers lead employees to better performance and mental well-being. We discuss potential explanations and implications.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, Behavioral Economics and Decision Analysis.Funding: K. Czura and F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of option-implied information for predicting the cross-section of stock returns. Based on large sets of firm and option characteristics and using traditional portfolio sorts and modern high-dimensional methods, we find that option information matters. However, in contrast to existing studies, there are only a few option characteristics that have significant incremental predictive power after controlling for the large set of firm characteristics. Further analysis reveals that the strongest option characteristics are associated with asset mispricing, future tail return realizations, and short-selling costs. Our findings are consistent with models of informed trading and limits to arbitrage.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: R. T.

    <title>The Effect of a System for Sharing Best Practices Within Pre-Existing Peer Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer networks, such as enterprise social networks (ESNs), can facilitate knowledge transfer across employees. However, such systems can also lead to information overload or difficulty in finding useful information. We examine data from a natural field experiment where a retailer introduced a system for sharing best practices (SSBP) in an existing online peer network, a control mechanism that enables easy access to well-organized best practices from high-performing units. The SSBP did not have a significant immediate or average effect on sales, however it significantly increased the sales trends of the stores where it was implemented. Sales improvement was greatest in stores that (a) perceived higher information overload from the online peer network before the intervention, or (b) had lower exposure to offline peers. The SSBP led to an increase, rather than decrease, of voluntary interstore knowledge sharing in the online peer network. These findings shed light on how a formal mechanism for sharing best practices can enhance the decision-facilitating role of relevant information without discouraging spontaneous knowledge sharing within the existing peer networks.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00990 .</content>

    <title>Guaranteed Demand and Corporate R&amp;amp;D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. government incentivizes firms to develop innovative technologies by awarding research and development (R&amp;D) contracts that often carry an implicit promise of “guaranteed demand.” Firms that demonstrate strong technological capabilities are rewarded with noncompetitive production contracts for the resulting products and services. Using newly assembled data on $4.2 trillion in government procurement contracts from all federal agencies, matched to U.S. publicly traded firms, we document a “crowding-in” effect, where government R&amp;D contracts lead to increased investment in corporate scientific research. This effect is concentrated in large, vertically integrated firms and limited to upstream R&amp;D. We argue that these patterns are best explained by a guaranteed demand mechanism: Firms co-invest in upstream research when success offers a credible path to future noncompetitive production contracts. We develop a theoretical framework to explain when it is optimal for the government to bundle R&amp;D and production contracts. Our analysis shows that guaranteed demand can produce higher quality at a lower total cost for upstream R&amp;D projects when the R&amp;D firms have production capabilities. Our empirical results support these predictions. Additionally, we find that the crowding-in effect has weakened over time as the government has increasingly decoupled R&amp;D contracts from production contracts. We discuss the potential implications of this decoupling.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: Financial support from the Alfred P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I test whether asset prices reflect risk exposures of financial intermediaries in a setting well-suited to tackling concerns about omitted risk factors. I analyze catastrophe bonds whose cash flows are linked to natural disasters and find that 71% of the security-level variation in expected returns can be explained by a theoretically motivated measure of intermediaries’ marginal utility. Assuming natural disasters are independent of aggregate wealth, this result is inconsistent with any alternative explanation based on unobserved macroeconomic risks. In addition, the aggregate premium decreases and becomes less sensitive to the occurrence of disasters when intermediaries’ access to outside capital improves. (JEL G12, G22)</content>

    <title>What Drives Risky Prescription Opioid Use? Evidence from Migration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and estimate a dynamic model of risky prescription opioid use that allows us to unpack the role of person- and place-specific drivers of the opioid epidemic and to assess the impact of state opioid policies. Event studies indicate that, among adults receiving federal disability insurance from 2006 to 2019, moves to states with higher rates of risky use produce an immediate jump in the probability of risky use, followed by an additional gradual increase for the next several years. Using a potential outcomes framework, we show how these results map to the person- and place-specific factors in the model. Model estimates imply large effects of place on both the likelihood of transitioning to addiction and the availability of prescription opioids; they also indicate that these place effects change significantly when state laws restricting pain clinics are enacted. A one standard deviation reduction in all place effects would have reduced risky use by about 40 percent over our study period. One particular source of place effects, pain clinic laws, reduced risky use by 5 percent, but could have reduced it by 30 percent if they had been enacted earlier, with much of this magnification operating through the dynamics of addiction.</content>

    <title>Conviction, Incarceration, and Recidivism: Understanding the Revolving Door</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Noncarceral conviction is a common outcome of criminal court cases: for every individual incarcerated, there are approximately three who were recently convicted but not sentenced to prison or jail. We extend the binary-treatment judge IV framework to settings with multiple treatments and use it to study the consequences of noncarceral conviction. We outline assumptions under which widely-used 2SLS regressions recover margin-specific treatment effects, relate these assumptions to models of judge decision-making, and derive an expression that provides intuition about the direction and magnitude of asymptotic bias when a key assumption on judge decision-making is not met. We find that noncarceral conviction (relative to dismissal) leads to a large and long-lasting increase in recidivism for felony defendants in Virginia. In contrast, incarceration (relative to noncarceral conviction) leads to a short-run reduction in recidivism, consistent with incapacitation. Our empirical results suggest that noncarceral felony conviction is an important and overlooked driver of recidivism.</content>

    <title>Fragile Interpersonal Relationship in Tacit Knowledge Sharing: How Workplace Friendship Fails Under Competition and Functional Similarity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the competitive landscape of modern business, tacit knowledge (TK) sharing has emerged as a critical enabler of innovation and transformation, particularly within the realm of operations management. In this context, the efficient flow of TK is essential for optimizing processes, promoting technology development, and sustaining competitive advantage. While the role of workplace friendship in facilitating TK sharing has been well-documented, there is a common misconception that close personal relationships alone suffice for effective knowledge transfer. However, in the complex dynamics of operational environments, these relationships can be unexpectedly fragile and prone to disruption. Even employees with strong workplace friendships may encounter inevitable challenges such as competition over limited resources, conflicts of interest, and diminished incremental benefits of knowledge exchange among functionally overlapping colleagues. Grounded in social information processing (SIP) theory, this study proposes a moderated mediation model and explores the negative moderating effects of competitive climate and functional similarity on the relationship between workplace friendship and TK sharing and how these factors subsequently impact innovation performance. Through a mixed-method design, including a main field study and a supplementary experiment involving 1,809 participants across various industries, our findings underscore that the positive association between workplace friendship and TK sharing will be diminished or even dissolved when employees perceive higher levels of competitive climate and functional similarity. By adopting a SIP perspective, this research elucidates how contextual factors in operational environments can overshadow the influence of workplace friendship on TK sharing. It also reveals the intricate interplay (i.e., mutual reinforcement) between the attitudes of TK holders and recipients, which is crucial for ensuring the seamless exchange of knowledge that drives operational excellence in highly competitive workplaces. These insights are vital for operations managers aiming to cultivate workforce diversity, regulate peer competition, inspire employee enthusiasm and engagement, and initiate cross-functional technology development projects. Such strategies foster effective and sustainable TK sharing, ultimately contributing to superior innovation performance in operational settings.</content>

    <title>Improving Transparency and Verifiability in School Admissions: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Students participating in centralized admissions procedures do not typically have access to the information used to determine their matched school, such as other students’ preferences or school priorities. This can lead to doubts about whether their matches were computed correctly (the “verifiability problem”) or, at a deeper level, whether the promised admissions procedure was even used (the “transparency problem”). In a model that spans many popular applications, we show how these problems can be addressed by providing appropriate feedback to students without disclosing sensitive information like other students’ preferences or school priorities. In particular, we show that the verifiability problem can be solved by (1) publicly communicating “cutoffs” (the minimum scores required to be eligible for each school) or (2) using “single-school” preference elicitation procedures that convey rich “experiential” information. In our main result, we show that the transparency problem can be solved by using cutoffs and single-school elicitation procedures together. We find strong support for these solutions in a laboratory experiment and show how they can be implemented for popular school admissions applications involving top trading cycles, and deferred and immediate acceptance.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [Project 100018_207722].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent regulatory discussions concentrate on the role institutional investors play in the financial sector. We investigate the determinants and consequences of institutional ownership (IO) in banks. Our findings suggest that institutional owners invest more in banks that have a lower proportion of consumer and real estate loans; are less opaque; have a lower level of insider control; are larger, older, and more capitalized; and have lower stock return volatility. In contrast, banks’ funding characteristics, loan risk appetite, and connectedness with other banks do not seem to be relevant factors in institutional investors’ decisions to hold a bank. We further investigate whether IO is related to tail risk comovement and changes in bank operations. We find robust evidence suggesting that IO is positively associated with a bank’s future tail risk and that the association between IO and tail risk is significantly higher for banks than it is for nonfinancial firms. We also find that this relationship is stronger for banks during economic downturns. Correspondingly, we find that there is a greater reduction in lending growth and greater increases in opacity and risk taking during recessionary periods for banks with higher levels of IO. Our results suggest that institutions with low monitoring incentives in particular play a role in increasing tail risk comovement and in the deleterious real effects of IO. Lastly, we find evidence suggesting that disclosure may play a role in mitigating the relationship between IO and tail risk comovement.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02522 .</content>

    <title>A social influence view of the internationalization of cultural products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A thriving international cultural industry fuels the expansion of the global creative economy. Yet, what drives the international diffusion and performance of cultural products? This study adopts a social influence perspective to examine the international performance of film exports, addressing a critical gap in existing research that often isolates social influences without considering the impact of their (in)congruence. Given the subjective nature of cultural products and their vulnerability to multiple influences across global value chains, we theorize and empirically test the effects of congruence and incongruence between supply-side and demand-side social influences on films’ international performance. Analyzing 1676 U.S. films released between 2009 and 2018, our findings reveal that congruence between supply-side and demand-side social influences significantly enhances a film’s appeal, credibility, and international success. Moreover, this effect is amplified by two key moderators across global value chains, namely, upstream home-country adoption of social media promotion and downstream host-country press freedom. This study contributes to the understanding of the social influence view within global value chains by highlighting the importance of supply-demand congruence and the contextual factors that shape their effectiveness in driving the international performance of cultural products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an empirical methodology for extracting pricing factors from investor portfolio data. We apply this approach to the stockholdings of Norwegian individual investors from 1997 to 2017. A two‐factor model, featuring the market portfolio and a long‐short portfolio constructed from the holdings of investors sorted by age or wealth, explains both the common variation in portfolio holdings and the cross section of stock returns. Portfolio tilts toward the long‐short investor factor correlate with indebtedness, macroeconomic exposure, gender, and investment experience. Our paper illustrates the benefits of using holdings data for explaining the risk premia of financial assets.</content>

    <title>Digital Bricolage and Its Limits: How Microenterprises Undertake Digitalization in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Small enterprises are under pressure to change and digitalize. Many have had to reimagine how they use digital technology to do business. Our research suggests that for microenterprises, digitalization can be an organic form of development, driven by making do with the digital resources at hand rather than a deliberate strategy that prioritizes investment in complex digital technology. Harnessing the potential of this could accelerate the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal to increase access to value chains and markets for small enterprises in developing countries. Our findings offer evidence for policymakers to rethink conventional strategies and develop more context-sensitive support mechanisms that reflect how digitalization actually unfolds in resource-limited settings. For information systems and management education research, the empirical study theorizes digitalization from an alternative perspective that is less emphasized in current literature. It considers the reality of many resource-limited business ventures around the world and their need to “make do.” This contrasts with the prevailing emphasis on cutting-edge technology in existing literature and case studies. By spotlighting the emergent, adaptive, and often improvised nature of small enterprise digitalization, this work invites a rethinking of how we teach, study, and support digital innovation in diverse global contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Divergent viewpoints have been shared regarding “return to office” mandates, which have aimed to reverse trends toward increased remote work. Employees affected by such recent mandates have generally reacted unfavorably, in many instances deciding to leave their organization, or in other instances withdrawing efforts. A recent trend that has been discussed as related to this issue is “quiet quitting”, which in part refers to withholding extra effort beyond satisfying minimum job requirements. Drawing from Self‐Determination Theory and Psychological Contract Theory, we investigated work arrangements that may foster different work outcomes, including behaviors associated with quiet quitting, such as neglect, reduced voice, and reduced citizenship behavior. Specifically, we examined differences in employee attitudes and behaviors as a function of three work modalities, including (1) fully in‐person, (2) fully remote, and (3) hybrid work. Results generally indicated more favorable outcomes for employees in a hybrid modality compared with in‐person or remote roles.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting is a relatively new phenomenon that has quickly caught the attention of both practitioners and academics. With the world of work becoming increasingly interconnected, we contribute to the discourse by approaching quiet quitting from the novel perspective of understanding how others in the workplace perceive those who engage in quiet quitting. To do so, we first provide a formalized definition of quiet quitting and differentiate coworkers' perceptions of quiet quitting from similar psychological constructs (Studies 1–3). We then examine employee responses to coworkers engaging in quiet quitting with a qualitative study (Study 4) and vignette design (Study 5), finding that as an employee's perception of coworker quiet quitting increases, supportive behaviors decrease and workplace incivility behaviors towards the coworker increase. The effect on workplace incivility behaviors is moderated by self‐rated quiet quitting, such that employees who had higher self‐rated quiet quitting were more likely to engage in incivility towards a coworker regardless of whether their coworker was quiet quitting. Overall, by exploring quiet quitting observed by a coworker, we provide a different perspective on this construct and extend past research to show how employees feel about and react to a coworker's quiet quitting behaviors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reaping IT Externality Benefits across Business Units in Multibusiness Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The indirect productivity gains related to information technology (IT), known as IT externalities, in inter-firm contexts have been extensively studied. However, the impact of IT investments within a business unit (BU) of a multibusiness firm on the productivity of other BUs remains unclear. Additionally, the conditions that facilitate such intra-firm externalities are not well understood. Research on resource externalities within multibusiness firms typically focuses on capacity-sharing benefits, where unused capacity in one unit can be utilized by another. IT resources, however, often lack capacity-sharing potential due to their full utilization or contractual limitations. Despite this, IT resources can generate non-rivalrous intangibles, such as internally-developed applications, expertise, and consulting know-how, which can be shared within the firm to create externalities.This study investigates whether IT centralization (ITC), as a vertical coordination mechanism, is effective in harnessing IT externality potential arising from IT portfolio similarities (ITPS), a form of horizontal coordination, across BUs. Utilizing data from 8,374 unique units within 866 firms from 2005 to 2020, we find that BUs must meet two conditions—higher ITPS and higher levels of ITC—to realize greater intra-firm IT externality benefits. Furthermore, these benefits accrue from IT investments made by units with a sufficient number of IT employees. Interestingly, BUs with limited access to IT employees gain more from pooled IT investments. Our findings suggest that concurrent vertical and horizontal coordination, along with access to human talent for creating knowledge, code, and expertise from digital resources, are crucial for maximizing digital resource externalities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a novel scheduling approach for managing a mix of routine and same-day appointments in an outpatient clinic. While the well-known carve-out scheduling (COS) policy reserves the provider capacity for same-day patients, its use of dedicated slots for each patient class may increase the risk of system underutilization or overload and long patient wait times. We propose the mixed appointment scheduling (MAS) policy, which allows routine and same-day patients to share common appointment slots, and investigate its performance relative to COS. By formulating a new model to determine the optimal scheduling decisions under the MAS policy, we demonstrate that the problem’s objective function (the total daily cost) is no longer multimodular in the presence of priority service discipline and demand uncertainty. We develop efficient methods to identify optimal scheduling policies and show that MAS reduces system costs, improves utilization, and decreases delays, particularly when same-day demand is moderate relative to clinic capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ambulance offload delays (AODs) occur when emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are unable to promptly transfer patients to overwhelmed emergency departments. These delays postpone necessary care for the patient and hinder the EMS system from attending to new emergencies. This study introduces a real-time multi-priority patient transfer policy aimed at reducing these delays. We model the patient transfer problem as a stochastic dynamic program based on post-decision states, and develop approximate dynamic programming approaches to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we derive a lower bound for the optimal solution through information relaxation. We evaluate the proposed method using both synthetic and real EMS data from St. Paul, Minnesota. Our solution is close to the lower bound, and the resulting policy results in a triple-win situation. For patients, our policy reduces hospital wait times by 80%; for hospitals, our policy alleviates emergency department congestion, and we find that even partial compatibility leads to notable system-wide improvements; for the EMS system, ambulance utilization is reduced by more than 30%, and ambulances could handle more calls per day, with a reduction in lost calls exceeding 80%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimal Trading with Flexible Speed-Dependent Transaction CostsTransaction cost rates (TCRs) implied by most limit order books (LOBs) display irregular functional forms in trading speeds, making it difficult to fit them using the TCR functions proposed in prior studies. In “Optimal Trading with Speed-Dependent Transaction Cost Rates: A Flexible Framework,” Liu, Qian, and Xu develop a workhorse model to study optimal trade execution with general TCR functions. The piecewise linear TCR function form in the model can approximate any TCR functions. The authors characterize important features of the optimal trading strategy. The model simultaneously generates order-shredding and U-shape trading patterns for large required trades. In addition, the authors demonstrate that implementing common naive trading strategies, such as trading all the position instantly, or at a constant speed, or incorrectly assuming linear TCR function, can be costly.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between individual analysts’ exclusions that result in lower street earnings per share (EPS) forecasts than their EPS forecasts based on generally accepted accounting principles (i.e., EPS-decreasing exclusions) and the optimism of their target price forecasts. We document that analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions from their annual forecasts mainly relate to positive nonrecurring items already reported by the firm. We find that analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions are associated with more optimistic target prices. Our results also suggest that analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions contribute to the optimism in their target prices by enabling analysts to project higher earnings growth. Further analyses reveal that the relation between analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions and target price optimism is attributable, at least in part, to analysts’ strategic incentives for issuing favorable valuations.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service robots on organizational frontlines, notably in health and elderly care settings, promise to tackle staff shortages. In such service contexts, compliance is crucial for consumer well-being, but compliance with robot advice remains problematically low. This research explores how the source of robot advice affects compliance in human-robot interactions. In six studies, including four field studies with real human-robot interactions, the authors demonstrate that consumers are more likely to comply with advice given by a robot service provider when the source of advice is a human rather than the robot itself. This is because a human source of robot advice increases the feeling of accountability, or the expectation that one might need to justify one’s actions to others, which is more difficult to achieve with only robot social presence. In turn, this fosters advice adherence, which also persists over time across repeated interactions. However, when the robot embeds social cues in the advice, the difference in accountability and compliance between robot-only and robot advice with a human source attenuates. These insights hold enormous promise, especially for health care practitioners, institutions, and consumers for whom increased compliance can lead to better health outcomes, reduced hospital readmissions, improved recovery, and elevated well-being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;…is ”should I buy any?”. Under Bayesian portfolio theory, ongoing zero weights in cryptocurrency are surprisingly difficult to generate. With ten years of prior data, equity investors would need very pessimistic priors on mean returns to never buy cryptocurrency: -10.6% per month for Bitcoin, and -19.6% for a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. Most priors that involve never purchasing cryptocurrency imply shorting it. Optimal weights are generally small, non-trivial (1-5% magnitude), frequently positive, and smooth. The certainty equivalent gains from cryptocurrency are comparable to international diversification and prominent anomaly portfolios. Costs (storage, fees) would need to exceed 21-39% annually to deter trading.</content>
