    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The implementation of servitization as a business strategy remains a significant challenge for firms seeking to offer integrated product‐service bundles. Despite the growing body of research in the servitization literature, an integrative framework for explaining the recurring failures in servitization efforts has yet to emerge. Through a qualitative meta‐analysis of empirical evidence documented in existing case studies, we develop a process theory that examines the tensions between product and service businesses during the service business development process. Our study identifies three common servitization failure modes, highlights the contributing factors across various stages of servitization, and establishes causal links between structural elements and behavioral outcomes to explain the heterogeneity in service business performance. By adopting a process perspective, we provide a more nuanced understanding of servitization dynamics, offering new insights that complement and extend established theories on firm growth and capability development. We conclude by discussing managerial implications for firms pursuing a servitization strategy and outlining future research steps to test and further refine the proposed theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey a large, representative sample of retail investors in China to elicit their memories of stock market investments and their return expectations. We merge these survey data with administrative transaction data to test a model in which investors selectively recall past experiences to form their beliefs. Our analysis uncovers new facts about investor memory and highlights similarity-based recall as a key mechanism of belief formation in financial markets. A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns. Recalled experiences can explain cross-investor variation in return expectations and, in our setting, dominate actual experiences in their explanatory power. In the transaction data, we confirm that recalled experiences are reflected in investors’ trading decisions through a belief channel.</content>

    <title>Rent, Retrieve, Repeat Until Sold: Demand Process Specification and Modular Estimation Framework for the Rent‐to‐Own Business</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rent‐to‐own (RTO) firms rent products for a periodic fee and allow a renter to buy the rented product at specified buyout prices during the rental. Accurately capturing the renters' decision process, as well as their ownership and rental utilities, is required for determining their willingness to pay buyout prices in different periods. We develop a modular framework that cleanly separates solving a renter's decision problem from estimating utility. We consider renters with varying degrees of sophistication and alertness to buyout offers. Using washer, dryer, and mattress data from a prominent RTO firm, for each decision model, we estimate utilities and the probabilities of abandoning the rental, neglecting the buyout offer, and considering the buyout offer. We find that renters have short decision horizons and frequently neglect buyout offers. Also, their utilities remain stable throughout the rentals. Moreover, renters who opt for rental agreements with higher rental fees or longer terms tend to have higher ownership utilities. Based on our counterfactual analyses, for washer or dryer renters, we suggest initiating efforts to remind renters of buyout offers. In contrast, for mattresses, whose renters more frequently consider buyout offers, we find that profits would be increased by setting prices higher.</content>

    <title>Too Much, Too Soon, for Too Long: The Dynamics of Competitive Executive Compensation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine executive compensation in a general equilibrium model with dynamic moral hazard, where executives' outside options are endogenously determined by equilibrium market compensation. Firms provide incentives through compensation packages featuring deferred payments as “carrots” and termination as “sticks.” Crucially, the effectiveness of termination as an incentive device is undermined by the outside options available to executives. As individual firms fail to internalize the effect of their compensation design on these endogenous outside options, the equilibrium is generally inefficient. Compared to shareholder‐value‐maximizing compensation packages, executives are paid too much, too soon, and keep their jobs for too long.</content>

    <title>Scaling Emerging Healthcare Technology: Managing Paradoxical Tensions in A Connected Health Platform</title>
    <updated>2025-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To address growing geographical disparities in healthcare access and quality, connected health platforms (CHPs) have emerged as promising solutions. However, rapidly scaling CHPs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing tensions among multiple entities. This study examines the digital scaling process of a CHP through the lens of paradox theory, focusing on tensions and their management in resource‐constrained environments. We conducted a 13‐year longitudinal case study of a CHP encompassing over 300 hospitals in China. Our findings reveal three distinct yet interconnected phases of digital scaling: digital foundation building; system integration and governance; and continuous improvement and innovation. We demonstrate that tensions evolve over time during the scaling process, with one dominant type prevailing in each phase, challenging previous assumptions that different tensions emerge simultaneously across multiple entities. We also identify phase‐specific “both‐and” responses employed by rural hospitals to manage tensions despite experiencing resource constraints. We provide guidance to organizations operating in resource‐constrained environments on the management of paradoxical tensions across a complex digital scaling process.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using account‐level data on millions of U.S. middle‐class investors over 2006 to 2018, we characterize the share of investable wealth that they hold in the stock market over their working lives. Relative to the 1990s, this share has both risen by 10% and become age‐dependent. The Pension Protection Act (PPA)—which allowed target date funds (TDFs) to be default options in retirement plans—played an important role: younger (older) workers starting at a firm after TDFs became the default option post‐PPA invested more (less) in stocks, in line with the TDF glidepath. In contrast, contribution rates changed little following the PPA.</content>

    <title>Traditional Institutions in Modern Times: Dowries as Pensions When Sons Migrate</title>
    <updated>2025-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses newly-collected data on the allocation of dowry to examine its role in resolving intergenerational frictions around migration in India. Migration disrupts traditional elderly support structures, in which sons live near their parents and care for them in old age. We develop a model in which dowry can promote migration by allowing sons to make upfront transfers to their parents and ease constraints on income sharing. To test this hypothesis, we collect two new datasets that measure the distribution of dowry between family members. We document for the first time that net transfers of dowry to a man’s parents are common but far from universal. Consistent with using dowry for income sharing, such transfers occur more often when sons migrate, especially when they work in higher-earning occupations. In nationally representative data, migration rates are higher in areas with stronger historical dowry traditions. Finally, exploiting a large-scale highway construction program, we show that men from areas with stronger historical dowry traditions migrate more when migration costs fall. Our findings provide some clues as to why dowry persists despite its well-documented adverse consequences.</content>

    <title>Aggregation and the Estimation of Quality Change: Application to U.S. Import Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the contribution of changes in quality, price, and variety entry/exit to the aggregate price index for smooth, invertible demand systems, generalizing the standard results derived in the CES case. The results require the knowledge of heterogeneous cross-product elasticities of substitution. To apply them in practice, we also show how to identify rich demand systems using data only on prices and market shares, without the need for external cost-shock instruments or strong assumptions on the covariance between supply and demand shocks. Using this approach, we compute the US import price index based on the Kimball demand system. We find that quality change on average lowered the inflation in import prices by around 0.007 log points annually (1989–2016). To further validate our approach, we show that it estimates price elasticities and quality changes similar to those found by the standard mixed logit (BLP) demand in data on the US auto market.</content>

    <title>Decoupling Firm Growth From Carbon Emissions: A Supply Network Role Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To achieve meaningful progress in carbon neutrality, absolute carbon emissions must be reduced. One possible approach is to decouple firms' growth trajectories from their emissions. Adopting a supply network perspective, this study examines how firms in different network roles decouple their growth from carbon emissions across all scopes. Focusing on the aerospace and defense industry's supply network, we apply an ego‐temporal exponential random graph model (ego‐TERGM) to empirically infer four previously conceptualized firm roles—negotiator, orchestrator, executor, and compromiser—based on structural and nodal characteristics. The findings of our exploratory analysis reveal significant differences in decoupling performance: the firms in roles characterized by denser ego networks decouple more effectively, while those in roles characterized by central and monopolistic positions tend to perform worse. These differences reflect the influence of power dynamics and network dependencies on firms' decoupling abilities. Central firms must navigate complex demands, while those in denser network roles experience stronger normative pressures to conform to sustainable practices. Beyond these network effects, decoupling can be further supported by setting more ambitious emissions targets, adopting moderate growth strategies, and prioritizing environmental innovation.</content>

    <title>Developing Generative AI for Value Co‐Creation: An Intervention‐Based Randomized Field Experiment in a Healthcare Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Owing to limited healthcare resources, there has been increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) interventions to treat mental health problems of chronic disease patients in developing countries. However, it is challenging to overcome the AI trust crisis in the healthcare context and develop AI that improves the patient's personalized experience and the quality of care. Elaborating on the value co‐creation theory using an actor–network theory (ANT) approach, this study examines how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can improve post‐discharge care for patients with cardiovascular disease in resource‐limited settings. Using an intervention‐based research approach in collaboration with a major hospital in China, researchers co‐designed a GenAI intervention with potential users and various stakeholders. Through a randomized controlled trial, we further evaluated the impact of a co‐created GenAI intervention on the post‐discharge self‐confidence and quality of care of 114 patients. Compared with the standard post‐discharge care process, chronically ill patients who received the GenAI intervention experienced a 6.049‐point (out of a total of 80 points) decrease in state anxiety and an 87.8% decrease in the 30‐day readmission risk. The insights gained from the intervention process, as interpreted using the ANT approach, expand the generic framework of value co‐creation to include a more GenAI‐mediated network of human and non‐human objects. Results reveal GenAI's boundary‐spanning and integrating roles as a critical node in the emerging, dynamic, value‐creating actor network. The inclusion of “a nonparticipant observe” allows us to offer cognitive explanations for why GenAI works. Overall, this study contributes to healthcare operations management by designing a process for developing and implementing GenAI to improve healthcare operations.</content>

    <title>Insurance Versus Moral Hazard in Income-Contingent Student Loan Repayment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Student loans with income-contingent repayment insure borrowers against income risk but can reduce their incentives to earn more. Using a change in Australia’s income-contingent repayment schedule, I show that borrowers reduce their labor supply to lower their repayments. These responses are larger among borrowers with more hourly flexibility, a lower probability of repayment, and tighter liquidity constraints. I use these responses to estimate a dynamic model of labor supply with frictions that generate imperfect adjustment. My estimates imply that the labor supply responses to income-contingent repayment limit the optimal amount of insurance in government-provided student loans. However, these responses are too small to justify fixed repayment contracts: restructuring existing student loans from fixed repayment to a constrained-optimal income-contingent loan—while keeping the tax and transfer system unchanged—increases borrower welfare by the equivalent of a 0.8% increase in lifetime consumption at no additional fiscal cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use arbitrage activity in equity, fixed income, and foreign exchange markets to characterize the frictions and constraints facing intermediaries. The average pairwise correlation between the 32 arbitrage spreads that we study is 22%. These low correlations are inconsistent with canonical intermediary asset pricing models. We show that at least two types of segmentation drive arbitrage dynamics. First, funding is segmented—certain trades rely on specific funding sources, making their arbitrage spreads sensitive to localized funding shocks. Second, balance sheets are segmented—intermediaries specialize in certain trades, so arbitrage spreads are sensitive to idiosyncratic balance‐sheet shocks.</content>

    <title>What Drives Risky Prescription Opioid Use? Evidence from Migration</title>

      <name>Amy Finkelstein, Matthew Gentzkow, Dean Li</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and estimate a dynamic model of risky prescription opioid use that allows us to unpack the role of person- and place-specific drivers of the opioid epidemic and to assess the impact of state opioid policies. Event studies indicate that, among adults receiving federal disability insurance from 2006 to 2019, moves to states with higher rates of risky use produce an immediate jump in the probability of risky use, followed by an additional gradual increase for the next several years. Using a potential outcomes framework, we show how these results map to the person- and place-specific factors in the model. Model estimates imply large effects of place on both the likelihood of transitioning to addiction and the availability of prescription opioids; they also indicate that these place effects change significantly when state laws restricting pain clinics are enacted. A one standard deviation reduction in all place effects would have reduced risky use by about 40 percent over our study period. One particular source of place effects, pain clinic laws, reduced risky use by 5 percent, but could have reduced it by 30 percent if they had been enacted earlier, with much of this magnification operating through the dynamics of addiction.</content>

    <title>Conviction, Incarceration, and Recidivism: Understanding the Revolving Door</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Noncarceral conviction is a common outcome of criminal court cases: for every individual incarcerated, there are approximately three who were recently convicted but not sentenced to prison or jail. We extend the binary-treatment judge IV framework to settings with multiple treatments and use it to study the consequences of noncarceral conviction. We outline assumptions under which widely-used 2SLS regressions recover margin-specific treatment effects, relate these assumptions to models of judge decision-making, and derive an expression that provides intuition about the direction and magnitude of asymptotic bias when a key assumption on judge decision-making is not met. We find that noncarceral conviction (relative to dismissal) leads to a large and long-lasting increase in recidivism for felony defendants in Virginia. In contrast, incarceration (relative to noncarceral conviction) leads to a short-run reduction in recidivism, consistent with incapacitation. Our empirical results suggest that noncarceral felony conviction is an important and overlooked driver of recidivism.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an empirical methodology for extracting pricing factors from investor portfolio data. We apply this approach to the stockholdings of Norwegian individual investors from 1997 to 2017. A two‐factor model, featuring the market portfolio and a long‐short portfolio constructed from the holdings of investors sorted by age or wealth, explains both the common variation in portfolio holdings and the cross section of stock returns. Portfolio tilts toward the long‐short investor factor correlate with indebtedness, macroeconomic exposure, gender, and investment experience. Our paper illustrates the benefits of using holdings data for explaining the risk premia of financial assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.</content>
