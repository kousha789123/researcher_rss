    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research has examined whether individuals earn greater returns in entrepreneurship than in wage work but has paid little attention to gender differences in these returns. Using Swedish employee–employer data from 1990 to 2020, we compare individuals' earnings before and after they transitioned to entrepreneurship. We find that women founders earn less than men, yet this gap is smaller than in wage employment. Additionally, entrepreneurship yields disproportionately greater returns for (a) high‐ability women facing glass ceilings in salaried positions, and (b) women in male‐typed industries who encounter greater barriers to advancement in wage work. Together, these findings show that entrepreneurship can enable women to realize greater returns to their human capital, particularly when they face stronger constraints in paid employment.Managerial SummaryThis study examines whether entrepreneurship widens or narrows the gender earnings gap compared to wage work. Using comprehensive Swedish data that track individuals before and after founding new businesses, we show that, although women founders earn less than men in absolute terms, they experience substantially larger earnings gains than men when moving from wage work to entrepreneurship. This advantage is most pronounced for high‐ability women and for women in male‐dominated industries, who face stronger barriers to advancement in salaried work. Our findings indicate that entrepreneurship offers women a pathway to realize greater returns to their skills and experience, yielding disproportionately higher earnings compared to remaining in salaried jobs. For organizations, these results highlight how structural constraints in wage employment can push talented women toward entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Task co‐use and product improvement: An organization design perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Co‐using tasks—using the same task to produce more than one product—promises economies of scope. However, task co‐use also ties products together, changing a firm's task network by introducing cross‐product interdependencies. In light of these interdependencies, we identify an unrecognized downside of task co‐use for product reliability: Cross‐product interdependencies complicate task design and increase the risk of malfunctions. Hence, task co‐use may carry a reliability penalty. Second, we propose that the reliability penalty of task co‐use may shrink with experience as cross‐product interdependencies allow for cross‐improvements and therefore potentially higher improvement rates of task co‐using products. We study the US automotive industry and find our predictions supported, indicating that task co‐use is a critical design parameter with important consequences for reliability and product improvement.Managerial SummaryUsing the same tasks to produce multiple products can help firms lower costs and achieve economies of scope. However, this practice also links products more tightly together, creating interdependencies across product lines. These interdependencies can make tasks harder to design and manage, increasing the likelihood of errors or malfunctions. As a result, task co‐use may reduce product reliability—an important but often overlooked drawback. At the same time, co‐used tasks can enable portfolio‐wide improvements— improvements across products. As firms gain experience, problems identified in one product can lead to improvements that benefit others using the same tasks. Over time, these cross‐improvements accelerate product improvement for task co‐using products and can reduce the initial reliability disadvantage. Evidence from the U.S. automotive industry supports these arguments. The findings show that task co‐use is a key design decision that involves meaningful trade‐offs between cost savings, reliability, and improvement. For managers, this highlights the importance of carefully evaluating when and how tasks should be co‐used across products, as these choices have lasting implications for product quality and improvement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that U.S. firms cut imports by 31.8% when their international suppliers experience environmental and social (E&amp;S) incidents. These trade cuts are larger for publicly listed U.S. importers facing high E&amp;S investor pressure and lead to cross-country supplier reallocation, suggesting that E&amp;S preferences in capital markets can be privately costly but have real effects for foreign suppliers. Larger trade cuts around the incident result in better supplier E&amp;S performance in subsequent years and in the eventual resumption of trade. Our results highlight the role of investors in ensuring suppliers’ E&amp;S compliance along global supply chains.</content>

    <title>(Not) Thinking About the Future: Financial Information and Maternal Labor Supply</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does information about the long-run financial costs of reduced labor supply increase mothers’ working hours? We document descriptively that long-term financial factors are not top of mind when mothers decide on their employment level. Moreover, a substantial share of women holds overly optimistic expectations about pension receipt and wage growth under part-time work. In a large-scale field experiment in Switzerland, we randomly assign mothers working part-time as teachers to receive objective information about the long-run costs of reduced labor supply. The treatment increases both demand for financial information and future labor supply plans, in particular among women who underestimate the costs of part-time work. Leveraging linked employer administrative data one year post-intervention, we find that this group of mothers increases working hours by 7 percent. These findings underscore that policies reducing information frictions in labor supply decisions may help address remaining gender gaps in the labor market.</content>

    <title>The Rapid Adoption of Generative AI</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) is a potentially important new technology, but its impact on the economy depends on the speed and intensity of adoption. This paper reports results from a series of nationally representative U.S. surveys of genAI use at work and at home. As of late 2024, 45% of the U.S. population age 18–64 uses genAI. Among employed respondents, 27% used genAI for work at least once in the previous week: 10% used it every workday and 17% on some but not all workdays. Relative to each technology’s first mass-market product launch, work adoption of genAI has been faster than the personal computer (PC), and overall adoption has outpaced both PCs and the internet by an even wider margin. Between 1% and 7% of all work hours are currently assisted by genAI, and respondents report time savings equivalent to 1.4% of total work hours. Potential productivity gains vary widely by industry, and firm climate and policies play an important role in adoption patterns.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardello, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Walmart Foundation [Grant 252882].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.02523 .</content>

    <title>Do Consumers Vote with Their Feet in Response to Negative ESG News? Evidence from Foot Traffic to Retail Locations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and, if so, how retail consumers change their shopping in response to firm‐specific negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news. Using an event study methodology, we do not find significant changes in consumer foot traffic in response to negative ESG news, on average. However, the average consumer reacts negatively when such news is covered by national or global media outlets, which elevates consumer awareness. In addition, we provide evidence of the heterogeneity in responses to negative ESG news across consumer groups. Consumers in more ESG‐conscious counties, as measured by county ESG preferences, income, education, and political ideology, reduce store visits in response to negative ESG news. In contrast, consumers in the least ESG‐conscious counties increase their visits in response to negative ESG news. These opposing reactions explain the insignificant average consumer response to negative ESG news. Furthermore, the ESG‐conscious consumers' negative reaction is, at most, modest, dissipating within six weeks. Overall, our findings suggest that firms face divergent responses to ESG activities from different consumer groups, underscoring the divisive nature of ESG issues.</content>

    <title>How Do You Identify a Good Manager?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce and validate a novel approach to identifying good managers. In a pre-registered lab experiment, we causally identify managerial contributions by randomly assigning managers to teams and controlling for individual skill. We find that manager contributions are crucial for team success, and that people who self-select into management roles perform worse than randomly assigned managers. Managerial performance is strongly predicted by economic decision-making skill, but not by demographic characteristics. Two validation studies support our experimental results. Participants who succeed in the lab receive more real-world promotions and, in a separate study of retail store managers, skill measures strongly predict store sales. A one standard deviation increase in manager quality increases annual per-store sales by $4.1 million USD (25% increase). Selecting managers on skills rather than demographic characteristics or the desire to lead could substantially improve organizational performance.</content>

    <title>Family Political Embeddedness: A Double-Edged Sword For Entrepreneurial Entry in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Political embeddedness and family embeddedness are two influential yet distinct areas of entrepreneurship research. In this study, we integrate these two streams of research to focus on family political embeddedness and its implications for new venture creation. Drawing on the social embeddedness perspective and utilizing a longitudinal dataset of 17,084 individuals from the China Family Panel Studies (2014–2022), complemented by 32 qualitative interviews, we examine the relationship between family political embeddedness and entrepreneurial entry, revealing a nuanced interplay. Our theory and related findings reveal a general negative relationship between family political embeddedness and entrepreneurial entry. However, we also unveil an indirect pathway through which family political embeddedness can foster entrepreneurial entry through political news consumption. Finally, we theorize and find that perceived government efficiency strengthens the relationship between political news consumption and entrepreneurial entry. Our work yields important theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using unique, daily, account‐level data, we investigate deposit outflows and inflows in a distressed bank. We observe anoutflowof uninsured depositors following bad regulatory news. Both regular and temporary deposit insurance reduce outflows. We provide important new evidence that, simultaneous with deposit outflows, depositinflowsare first order. Uninsured deposit outflows were largely offset with new insured deposit inflows as the bank approached failure, with the bank increasing term deposit rates. This phenomenon holds in a large sample of banks that faced regulatory action, suggesting that insured deposit inflows are an important mechanism that weakens depositor discipline.</content>

    <title>Model Ambiguity versus Model Misspecification in Dynamic Portfolio Choice</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study aversion to model ambiguity and misspecification in dynamic portfolio choice. Risk‐averse investors (relative risk aversion ) fear return persistence, while risk‐tolerant investors () fear mean reversion, when confronting model misspecification concerns of identically and independently distributed (IID) returns. The intuition is that risk‐averse investors, who want to hedge intertemporally, endogenously fear return persistence, which precludes hedging. A log investor is myopic and unaffected by model misspecification, therefore only worrying about model ambiguity. Our model can generate belief scarring, nonparticipation in equity markets, and extrapolative return expectations. Extending beyond IID returns, we study model misspecification for a mean‐reverting Sharpe ratio.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The link between corporate bond credit spreads and secondary market illiquidity in the cross section has grown stronger since 2005, resulting in a higher liquidity component in credit spreads. Using U.S. investor holdings data, we show that short‐term investors (e.g., mutual funds/exchange‐traded funds [ETFs]) increase trading activities in the secondary market, amplifying the effect of secondary market frictions on prices. We provide a model featuring heterogeneous investors with different trading needs and heterogeneous bonds to investigate the impact of the rapid‐growing mutual fund/ETF sector on the corporate bond market. We find the change in investor composition can quantitatively explain the aggregate trend.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between 2009 and 2011, the Spanish banking system underwent a restructuring process based on savings banks’ consolidation. The program’s design allows us to study how banks’ consolidation affects credit supply and performance. We propose a quasi-experimental analysis showing that bank mergers restrict credit supply and set higher interest rates but also reject fewer applicants and report fewer nonperforming loans. We then estimate a structural model of credit in which banks set interest rates and lending standards. We find that, despite the relaxation in their lending standards, merged banks’ credit performance improved thanks to a significant drop in their screening costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are exposed to varying levels of supply chain risk and engage in efforts to resolve such risk. This paper examines how disclosures of supply chain risk and resolution during earnings calls affect firms’ stock returns. Using natural language processing, we develop measures of supply chain risk and resolution from quarterly earnings call transcripts for a total of 129,981 firm-quarter observations between 2008 and 2019. We find that higher levels of supply chain risk are associated with lower stock returns around earnings calls, while disclosures of supply chain risk resolution attenuate these negative effects. In particular, stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk quintile are 1.07% lower compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile, and regression analyses indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in supply chain risk is associated with a 0.56% decline in stock returns. The stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk resolution quintile are 0.12% higher compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile. A one-standard-deviation increase in resolution increases stock returns by 0.08%, and to 0.29% for the subsample of observations where the resolution measure is positive. Exploratory analyses indicate that the effect of supply chain risk on stock returns is significantly greater for smaller firms than for larger firms. In addition, when there is evidence that larger firms’ resolution-related statements are mere rhetoric, the effect of resolution on stock returns is diminished.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Cross-Platform Spillover Effect of Promotion: Evidence from the PC Game Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform owners employ strategic promotions (e.g., platform-initiated penetration pricing) to enlarge their customer base. Under the conventional price-driven economic logic, such promotions are expected to divert demand for the identical goods away from competing platforms, as extensively documented in the conventional brick-and-mortar store context. However, they can also boost the demand. In environments where customers can easily access the identical goods on competing platforms, the increased awareness by strategic promotion, coupled with other non-price factors, can stimulate the purchases of such goods on competing platforms. As such, the effect of strategic promotions on competitive dynamics remains unclear despite their importance for platforms and today’s intensifying platform competition. We utilize the context of online PC game marketplaces where Steam and Epic Games Store dominate. Using the synthetic control approach, our analysis finds that the strategic promotion by Epic Games Store, which offers selected games for free for a week, rather increases the sales of the identical games on Steam substantially (by 59.2%) during that week. In essence, although consumers could obtain the games for free on the promoting platform, more consumers purchased the identical games on the competing platform than before. To comprehensively understand the drivers and conditions of this phenomenon, we perform complementary analysis based on the Attention-Interest-Desire-Action framework, following the progression of consumers’ cross-platform purchase decision process. Using consumer survey and product review data, along with the decomposition of the treatment effect, our results suggest that the effect is more prominent when the price gap between platforms is small and externalities between users or between goods offered by Steam are high. Taken together, our study unveils a unique aspect of strategic promotion in the context of platform competition and highlights the crucial role of externalities in shaping the competitive landscape of digital platforms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Do More Services Lead to Better Buyer-supplier Relationships? The Unintended Consequence of Manufacturing Firms Providing Customer Solutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature has highlighted the value of the solution business model for manufacturing firms. In this research, we investigate the dark side of providing customer solutions and challenge an assumption held by extant research: that shifting from selling individual products to providing customer solutions enhances buyer-supplier relationships. Drawing on the frame problem view and expectation-(dis) confirmation theory, we examine the impact of provision of customer solutions on customer default. We also explore contingent factors that either magnify or mitigate this effect. Using a longitudinal dataset of 2,218 observations from 446 Chinese listed firms between 2012 and 2020, we find that provision of customer solutions increases the likelihood of customer default. Moreover, we show that this positive impact is stronger in industries with higher turbulence and for firms with greater advertising intensity, but weaker for firms with stronger operational capability. These findings suggest that provision of customer solutions can damage buyer-supplier relationships by reducing the likelihood of meeting customer expectations and increasing transaction disputes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the key claims in the paper “Robust Contract Designs: Linear Contracts and Moral Hazard” by Yu and Kong (2020) is proposition 4. This proposition states that when designing the best robust contract—assuming the agent’s utility function is piecewise linear and concave—the optimal solution involves only progressive fixed payments and linear rewards with progressive commission rates. In this note, we provide a clear counterexample backed by a detailed proof to show that this claim is actually incorrect. We further use numerical examples to demonstrate that the contract design suggested by Yu and Kong can perform significantly worse than expected. Lastly, we identify and explain the specific mistakes in their mathematical proofs that led them to this incorrect conclusion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The removal of an intertemporal tax discontinuity in Germany provides us with a natural experiment to study the causal effect of taxes on individual stock-trading behavior and the disposition effect. Using individual investor transactions data combined with nonparametric regressions and bunching methods, we find that the presence of the tax discontinuity induces investors to adjust their holding periods, which reduces their effective tax rate by 11.3%. We also find that tax effects dominate the disposition effect in the days around the discontinuity and can inhibit it (by about 20%) during the six months preceding the discontinuity. We discuss the consequences of our results for the firms whose stocks are traded and policy implications.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, more than a quarter of the working-age population experiences physical disabilities that shape workplace participation and career outcomes. Drawing on 168 articles, we synthesize the management literature to develop a unifying framework of focal mechanisms, workplace outcomes, and boundary conditions. In doing so, we offer a clear definition of physical disability, long absent from management research. We also highlight the fragmented theoretical and methodological landscape, in which most studies aggregate disability types, overlooking critical heterogeneity. Our review charts a path forward by identifying key gaps, outlining directions for future scholarship, and emphasizing the need for stronger theoretical grounding and methodological rigor. Finally, we discuss implications for policy and practice, underscoring how greater inclusion of persons with physical disabilities can advance various workplace outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using proprietary transaction‐level data on nonsyndicated construction loans, we provide some of the first empirical evidence on the drivers and consequences of bank monitoring through on‐site inspections.  Banks trade off monitoring intensity with favorable origination terms. Monitoring intensity escalates in response to local economic downturns or the bank's financial instability.  Borrowers with negative inspection reports have more draw requests denied, suggesting that monitoring outcomes impact credit decisions. Both the occurrence and threat of increased inspection frequency correspond to reduced defaults. Overall, our results provide empirical support for a substantial body of theoretical literature on bank monitoring.</content>

    <title>When Family Firm Reputation Backfires: The Role of Controllability in Consumer Responses to Negative CSR Incidents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We apply attribution theory to examine how family ownership status shapes consumer attitudes toward companies after negative corporate social responsibility incidents, focusing on incident controllability. Two longitudinal experiments reveal that, when controllability isunknown, consumers infer lower controllability for family firms and thus hold more favorable attitudes toward them than non-family firms. However, when controllability isknown, low-controllability incidents lead to similar attitudes across firm types, whereas high-controllability incidents reverse the effect, resulting in more negative attitudes toward family firms than non-family firms. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that family firms consistently benefit from their reputation and inform stakeholder communication strategies.</content>

    <title>Inference Based on Time-Varying SVARs Identified with Sign Restrictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for Bayesian inference in TV structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) identified with sign restrictions. The linchpin of our approach is a class of rotation-invariant TV SVARs in which the prior and posterior densities of any sequence of structural parameters belonging to the class are invariant to {orthogonal transformations} of the sequence. Our methodology is new to the literature. In contrast to existing algorithms for inference based on sign restrictions, our algorithm is the first to draw from a uniform distribution over the sequences of orthogonal matrices given the reduced-form parameters. We illustrate our procedure for inference by analyzing the role played by monetary policy during the latest inflation surge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the latest monetary policy tightening cycle, capital has been flowing from low-inflation countries to high-inflation countries. This pattern of capital flows is consistent with the predictions of an open-economy model with nominal rigidities where cost-push shocks generate an inflationary episode and capital flows freely across countries. Yet, by raising demand for domestic non-tradable goods and services, capital inflows cause unwelcome upward pressure on firms’ costs in countries most severely hit by these shocks. We find that a reverse pattern of capital flows would have improved the output-inflation trade-off globally, hence requiring a less aggressive monetary tightening in the most severely hit countries and delivering overall welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Do Financial Advisors Charge Sustainable Investors a Premium?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite growing regulatory concerns about potential overcharging of sustainable investors, empirical evidence is lacking. In two controlled laboratory-in-the-field experiments with 415 professional financial advisors from Europe and the United States and an incentivized survey, we identify two distinct but interacting effects. First, advisors charge sustainable investors a premium. This premium persists even when accounting for differences in skill, effort, and costs. Second, advisors impose higher fees on clients with low financial literacy. These factors interact. Sustainable investors with low financial literacy are charged the highest fee, whereas those with high financial literacy do not pay a sustainability premium. Our findings suggest that advisors extract additional fees for sustainable investment mandates but avoid overcharging sustainable investors with high financial literacy.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice(ETP) is committed to advancing transparency, replicability, credibility, and rigor in research. To support this commitment, we encourage authors to preregister their research plans, submit empirical studies as Registered Reports, and engage with our evolving editorial processes, such as Registered Revisions. Drawing on practices across multiple disciplines, we offer guidance for integrating these publication formats into our field. We also provide multiple resources to support authors in adopting these approaches and to address the unique challenges of applying such formats to, for example, secondary data. By more widely embracing the Registered Report approach, we envision a future for entrepreneurship research that is characterized by greater credibility, replicability, transparency, and scientific impact. In this editorial, we motivate and, hopefully, guide future work by making a specific call for manuscripts for a virtual special issue ofETPfocused on Registered Reports, strengtheningETP’s longstanding commitment to methodological innovation. We offer a prospective vision—what we believe would be good for future literature—and our aim is to empower scholars to proactively shape new theoretical and empirical foundations in entrepreneurship research that enhance the credibility and replicability of entrepreneurship research.</content>

    <title>Transformational Family Leaders in Multi-Unit Complex Family Firms: A Multilevel Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transformational leadership is recognized for bringing family members together; however, its role in multi-unit complex family firms that rely on nonfamily managers is poorly theorized. We find that transformational family chief executive officers (CEOs) positively affect the performance of business units run by nonfamily managers, suggesting that transformational family CEOs significantly influence nonfamily managers’ behavior. But the efficacy of that influence matters. Political skill enhances the transformational family CEO’s impact on business unit entrepreneurial orientation and financial performance. Business unit entrepreneurial orientation also mediates the relationship between the transformational family CEO and business unit financial performance, particularly when CEO’s political skill is high.</content>

    <title>Investing in Influence: Investors, Portfolio Firms, and Political Giving</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the rise of institutional ownership has influenced firms’ political activities. We find that, after the acquisition of a large stake, a firm’s political action committee giving mirrors more closely that of the acquiring investor. Consistent with a causal interpretation, this pattern is also observed for acquisitions driven by new index inclusions. The pattern is stronger when firms’ management faces contentious proposals in shareholder meetings and may thus need institutional investors’ support. We further show that firms’ giving shifts away from business-relevant politicians and is strongly aligned with the individual campaign donations of the institutional investors’ employees. These results, together with the finding that the effects are larger for more “partisan” and privately owned investors, suggest that the influence we uncover is driven by institutional investors’ own political views, rather than a profit-maximizing strategy for the portfolio firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms' and executives' stances on controversial issues affect consumer behavior. This “political consumerism” might be motivated by ideology and a desire to signal to peers, and thus vary for private and public purchases. We conduct an experiment with 1198 consumers to study how purchase visibility affects responses to CEO activism. Participants are randomly shown either generic product information or that plus a CEO statement supporting gun rights. They then choose between receiving the product or receiving cash, with half assigned to a condition where their choice is visible to someone they know. We find that CEO activism reduces demand among people who disagree with the CEO regardless of purchase visibility, indicating minimal signaling motives. Our results have implications for firms using politics to differentiate products.Managerial SummaryBusiness leaders who speak out on controversial social and political issues may attract or repel consumers who agree or disagree with their stance. Consumers may react more intensely when others can observe their purchases or boycotts, allowing them to “signal” their beliefs. We experimentally manipulate whether the decision to purchase a product from a firm whose CEO vocally supports gun rights is observable and whether consumers are aware of the CEO's stance. We find that consumers change their behavior in response to CEO political activism regardless of whether their choices are visible to others. This suggests that CEO activism can impel boycotts and that firms can differentiate themselves by taking political positions even when their products are less known or consumed privately.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the efficacy of remote arrangements between CEOs and firms. Such arrangements attract executive talent and overcome labor market segmentation but introduce frictions. Remote arrangements are associated with lower operating performance, firm valuation, and insider reviews. Using the private costs from uprooting the CEO’s spouse as an instrument for the CEO’s decision to seek remote work, we find similar negative effects. The performance decline increases for CEOs who live further away and who cross multiple time zones. The mechanisms include the CEO’s loss of information, short-termism, and consumption of leisure, such as recreational boats and beach homes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent advances in live-streaming technology have empowered millions of amateur content creators to broadcast live video over the internet, sharing events and experiences with consumers as they happen. Despite the growing popularity of live streams, little research has examined how liveness may affect viewers’ experiences and behaviors. The current research addresses this gap, and uses the context of amateur music performances to investigate how, when, and why viewing live streams (versus equivalent or identical pre-recorded video) can enhance presence, connection, enjoyment, and engagement. We find evidence of amere liveness effecton consumer experiences: simply knowing that an online video stream is live causes viewers to feel more connected to streamers. This effect is facilitated by an elevated sense of presence, or “being there,” in events that are viewed in real time. Critically, this effect also drives aliveness liftfor online streamers; viewers of live (versus pre-recorded) streams enjoy the content more, choose to continue watching longer, and are more willing to follow and subscribe to the streamers’ channels. These findings have clear substantive implications: marketers, platform developers, and content creators can enhance consumer connection, enjoyment, and engagement by going live.</content>

    <title>Corporate Tax System Complexity and Investment Sensitivity to Tax Policy Changes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective policymakers must balance the demands of formulating a corporate tax system that raises revenue and spurs economic activity (e.g., investment) while promoting a “level playing field” across firms. Balancing these tradeoffs has likely caused tax systems to become more complex over time, increasing firms’ difficulty in understanding and complying with tax regulations. We investigate the impact of tax system complexity on the responsiveness of firm‐level investment to tax policy changes. Exploiting staggered tax rate changes and variation in tax system complexity across countries, we document two key findings. First, firm‐level investment is less sensitive to changes in the corporate tax rate when tax system complexity is higher, suggesting that such complexity can undermine the ability of tax policy to affect economic growth. Second, the impact of tax complexity on the sensitivity of investment to tax rate changes varies significantly across firms, with domestic‐owned, smaller, and private firms being more affected. These cross‐sectional disparities are consistent with tax system complexity potentially reducing tax system parity. Collectively, our findings suggest that corporate tax system complexity can negatively impact the ability of fiscal policy to affect investment and lead to heterogeneous tax policy responses across firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the mode of search—independently or jointly—affect collective search, a central component of organizational adaptation and innovation? Using naturally occurring data from a strongly incentivized online competition platform, we find that compared to their counterfactuals that search apart, groups searching together exhibit less exploration in their search outcomes as noted in prior experimental and computational modeling studies. However, groups searching together stimulate a greater number of search attempts from their members than groups searching apart, an effect that has so far remained unnoticed. Further, both search attempts and exploration contribute positively to search performance. This suggests that the choice of search mode should depend on the demands of strategic contexts that make either the variety or volume of solutions relatively more important for collective search.Managerial SummaryHow members of a team interact when looking for solutions to problems shapes their success. Using evidence from online machine learning competitions, we find that looking for solutions together encourages members to examing more alternatives but narrows the range of these ideas, while working independently generates greater variety but fewer alternatives being examined. We propose that the choice between the two depends on context. When innovation requires novel, distinctive solutions, as in early‐stage R&amp;D, independent work may be more effective. When speed and volume matter, as in patent races or crowded digital markets, searching for solutions together delivers faster iteration. Managers can improve innovation outcomes by aligning the mode of teamwork with the strategic demands of the problem.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the impact of perceived cancer risk on housing values using widely advertised national reclassifications of chemical carcinogenicity in the United States. Combining these information events with an empirical design that compares changes in house values closer to affected toxic plants against those farther away isolates the effect of cancer risk news from other local factors. Focusing on plants previously emitting reclassified carcinogenic chemicals, we estimate a 1–2% decline in housing values within a 3-mile radius compared to those located farther away. The effects are stronger in areas with higher media presence underscoring the role of salience as a mechanism.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multichannel Experience, Product Attributes, and Consumer Return Behavior: An Empirical Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Omnichannel retailing has changed the way consumers shop, yet product returns remain a costly challenge. Conventional wisdom holds that adding sales channels provides better information about product fit and should help reduce returns. However, it is unclear how shopping experience across multiple channels influences what consumers buy and whether they return those purchases. There is also no clear consensus on why return rates increase in some omnichannel contexts but not others. We address this knowledge gap by focusing on consumers’ multichannel experience (MX) rather than mere channel adoption, and distinguishing two types of MX:remote-only(those who have used only non-physical channels like online and catalog) versushybrid(those who have used both non-physical and physical channels). We empirically analyze over 292,000 transactions from a European furniture retailer operating showroom, online, and catalog channels. Using a series of fixed-effects regressions with Heckman selection to address potential channel-selection bias, a control function approach to account for endogeneity due to omitted variable bias associated with MX, and a parallel mediation analysis, we find that consumers with MX are significantly more likely to return products than their counterparts with only single-channel experience (SX) (i.e., showroom, online, or catalog). This elevated return propensity is largely driven by MX shoppers’ greater tendency to buy niche products and experience goods, which carry higher uncertainty and return risk. Moreover, consumers with remote-only MX exhibit higher return rates than those with hybrid MX, and this gap is especially pronounced among consumers living farther from a physical showroom store. We conduct multiple robustness checks to verify the results. We also replicate the main findings with a new transaction data set from a U.S. retailer (leveraging a natural experiment). Theoretically, our work challenges assumptions that multichannel access inherently lowers returns, highlighting how MX can increase return risk through its effect on purchase behavior. Managerially, our findings inform product–channel matching strategies and omnichannel design, and point to targeted interventions based on consumer type (remote-only vs. hybrid) and geography (distance to stores) to ameliorate returns.</content>

    <title>These Are My (Micro)Confessions: An Episodic Theory of Employee Microconfessions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The trend of moralizing work presents a paradox for contemporary workers. Employees equate their failures to live up to “good employee” ideals (e.g., always available, highly motivated, passionate) with moral failings. Yet, consistently meeting these ideals is unattainable for most employees. This manuscript introduces and develops the phenomenon of microconfessions—informal, low-magnitude confessions—as an overlooked tactic that employees use to alleviate the ongoing moral dilemma of falling short on moralized work ideals. Integrating self-disclosure and work moralization scholarship with insights from fields that have explicitly studied confession, I build a theory of employee microconfessions. I suggest that microconfessions provide the sharer with a sense of relief and a restored sense of morality, which in turn, have downstream consequences. I also pinpoint guilt—an emotion particularly relevant to the moralization of work—as key to activating and strengthening the effects of microconfessions. Finally, I illuminate how the information shared and the setting in which it is shared jointly influence the effects that I outline. My work establishes microconfessions as a unique form of workplace self-disclosure and pivots existing theories to consider functions of disclosure historically overlooked in organizational scholarship. It also contributes new understanding to how employees may experience and offset the moralization of work as well as when it is most advantageous for them to do so.</content>

    <title>Delegation and Chief Financial Officer Retention: Evidence from Chief Accounting Officers on the Executive Team</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, chief financial officer (CFO) responsibilities and resignations have increased. Given these trends, we examine whether delegating accounting is associated with CFO retention. We develop a methodology to identify voluntary CFO departures using the firm’s public messaging around the CFO’s exit. Our results suggest that CFOs are less likely to voluntarily depart when accounting is delegated. Further, we find evidence that the negative association between delegating accounting and voluntary CFO departures is stronger when accounting demands are higher. Moreover, we find evidence that delegating accounting increases the CFO’s human capital. When CFOs do leave, they are more likely to become a chief executive officer and less likely to make a lateral move to another CFO position. Taken together, this study finds evidence consistent with the delegation of accounting increasing CFO retention and human capital.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: The authors appreciate research funding support from Coggin College of Business, University of North Florida and Tippie College of Business, University of Iowa.

    <title>The Role of Success and Failure in Fluid Teams: Evidence from the Motion Picture Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many business settings involve fluid teams, where team members come together to work on a project, after which the team is disbanded. It is well-known that coordination can be challenging and affect the performance outcomes of fluid teams. The literature has studied how several facets of experience can facilitate learning and improve outcomes for fluid teams. However, the role of experience with success and failure and its effect on improving outcomes for fluid teams has remained unexplored. In this study, we use data from the motion picture industry to examine how the experience with success and failure resident within key members of a movie production team affects profitability. Our analysis of the data for 2,091 movies released in the United States between 1999 and 2018 reveals that a movie’s profitability depends on the production team’s history with success and failure. Additionally, we find that teams with a history of success result in movies with higher profits, whereas teams with a history of failure result in movies with lower profits. We also find that increased relative dispersion in the team’s experience does not affect the movie’s profitability. Further analysis of the composition of movie teams indicates that financial performance can be significantly impacted when movie teams are predominantly composed of members with a history of success or failure. We contribute by illustrating a new measure of team experience relevant for fluid teams and by providing insights on how to compose teams based on members’ experience with success and failure.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03756 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify latent demands in index option markets using a sign-restricted vector autoregression (VAR) and highlight the bias from treating (equilibrium) net demand as exogenous. Market-maker and end-user demand curves are far from infinitely elastic as assumed by some models, but elasticities exceed existing estimates for equities. Characterizing demand curves provides insights into the structure of index option markets. Deteriorating market conditions are associated with right shifts of the latent demand curves. The at-the-money (ATM) (out-of-the-money (OTM)) markets for calls and puts are mainly driven by end-user (market-maker) demand, and end-user (market-maker) ATM (OTM) call option demand predicts S&amp;P500 returns.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04263 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Endorsement Rate in Influencer Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Influencer marketing has emerged as a prevalent marketing strategy for firms seeking to engage target customers, with significant research identifying various criteria for influencer selection. However, the role of endorsement rate—the proportion of an influencer’s brand-sponsored posts relative to their total social media posts—remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how influencers’ endorsement rates affect the effectiveness of their subsequent sponsored posts. Using a multimethod approach, including two field studies and two controlled experiments across diverse platform contexts (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Douyin), the findings reveal a consistent U-shaped relationship between endorsement rate and consumer engagement with sponsored posts. This pattern arises from the interplay of two countervailing forces: a higher endorsement rate enhances the influencer’s perceived brand recognition, yet it simultaneously raises audience suspicion of manipulative intent. Notably, organic product mentions and consistent brand endorsements can attenuate the impact of endorsement rates on consumer engagement. Beyond advancing research in influencer marketing and brand endorsements, these findings offer marketers a valuable framework for evaluating influencers and making more informed selections.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: THE BRAND BACKSTORY AND THE STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE OF TRANSPARENCY</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands use factory tours, visitor centers, and other behind-the-scenes encounters to share their histories and operations. These backstory performances are fragile events that must balance revealing and concealing. This article definesbrand backstoriesas selectively disclosive narratives offering a curated set of brand content, and conceptualizes brand backstory performances as spatially embedded enactments that invite consumers into a staged version of what feels like a backstage. Drawing on dramaturgical theory, we examine how brands negotiate the tension between showcasing transparency and retaining control during backstory performances. A multimethod investigation centered on four primary backstory sites identifies three interdependent dimensions of the backstory performance (staging performance elements, orchestrating the characters, and tailoring the script) that together modulate consumers’ experience of transparency. Backstory experiences must be skillfully delivered, stimulating, and safe to optimize perceived transparency. This research reframes brand transparency from a property that brands possess to a narrative experience they perform. It shows how contemporary brand storytelling depends on carefully curated and staged encounters that are calibrated to the optimal dosage of revelation to make insider status feel real without surrendering control.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conventional wisdom holds that lowering a home country's interest rate relative to another's will depreciate the domestic currency. We document that, at business‐cycle frequencies, U.S. forward guidance monetary policy easings had the opposite effect during the Great Recession. We attribute this effect to calendar‐based forward guidance that signaled economic weakness, resulting in a “flight‐to‐safety” effect and lower expected U.S. inflation. We also document cross‐currency heterogeneity: a surprise U.S. rate cut induced a larger appreciation of the dollar against currencies that typically depreciate more when the world economy is contracting. We build a model that can reconcile these findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of asset revaluation in the monetary transmission mechanism. We build an analytical heterogeneous‐agents model with two main ingredients: (i) rare disasters and (ii) heterogeneous beliefs. The model captures time‐varying risk premia and precautionary savings in a setting that nests the textbook New Keynesian model. The model generates large movements in asset prices after a monetary shock but these movements can be neutral on real variables. Real effects depend on the redistribution among agents with heterogeneous precautionary motives. In quantitative analysis, we find that this channel can account for a large fraction of the transmission to aggregate consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that a U‐shaped monetary rate path increases banking crisis risk, via credit and asset price cycles, analyzing 17 countries over 150 years. Rate hikes (raw or instrumented) increase crisis risk, but only if preceded by prolonged cuts. These patterns are unique to banking crises, unlike noncrisis recessions. Regarding the mechanism, prolonged cuts raise the likelihood of large credit and asset price booms, consistent with higher credit supply and risk‐taking. Subsequent hikes strongly reduce credit and asset prices, and increase banks' realized credit risk, rather than interest rate risk. We find consistent results in administrative loan‐level data for Spain.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Password Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Password sharing is widespread across subscription-based industries, such as streaming services like Netflix. Although sharing reduces out-of-pocket costs for users, it also creates sharing-related burdens, such as privacy concerns and coordination hassles. We develop a game-theoretic model in which a firm serves two consumer segments—password sharers and nonsharers—to analyze how password sharing affects firm performance and consumer outcomes. Our results show that sharing enables groups of users to “self-bundle” by aggregating their valuations and subscribing through a single shared account. It also creates implicit price discrimination; sharers self-select between sharing and subscribing individually under a uniform price. These mechanisms can increase a firm’s revenue when sharing costs are low. In addition, password sharing reshapes the disparity between sharers and nonsharers. When nonsharers have sufficiently higher willingness to pay, the firm is even more likely to benefit from sharing. However, password sharing poses policy concerns. We find that it reduces social welfare and consumer surplus across a broad range of conditions—especially when sharing costs are moderate. Moreover, the firm’s profit-maximizing strategy, particularly when it chooses to accommodate sharing, often conflicts with what is best for consumers or society. These insights highlight the need for firms to carefully evaluate sharing policies and in some cases, for regulators to intervene to protect consumer welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on crowdfunding has largely focused on fundraising success, overlooking post-success outcomes. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, we hypothesize that user entrepreneurs show higher intrinsic but lower extrinsic motivation than non-users, with intrinsic motivation boosting delivery performance and extrinsic motivation hindering it. Using a mixed-method approach—an exploratory qualitative study and an analysis of 322 crowdfunded ventures—we find that user entrepreneurs deliver rewards more timely than non-user entrepreneurs, and that intrinsic motivation significantly mediates this relationship, while extrinsic motivation’s mediating role is insignificant. We contribute to the user entrepreneurship and crowdfunding literatures by highlighting drivers of post-campaign success.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs use strategic framing to gain support for their novel ventures, products, and services. A key challenge entrepreneurs face is that audiences often contest frames that introduce novel ideas, especially when these ideas disrupt audiences' mental and business models. Such contestation can hinder novel ideas from being accepted, a risk that is amplified when entrepreneurs face contestation from multiple audiences. We lack understanding, however, of how contestation from multiple audiences shapes the strategic framing of novel ideas. We study this question at Tony's Chocolonely, a social enterprise that faced such contestation when introducing “slave‐free” chocolate. By showing how the social enterprise reacted to contestation from multiple audiences in different ways, we uncover novel mechanisms of frame change and stability.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs use strategic framing to gain support for their novel ideas, products, and services. In so doing, they must navigate resistance from different audiences, especially when entrepreneurs introduce novel ideas that disrupt the status quo. Audience resistance can hinder novel ideas from gaining momentum. We do not know, however, how entrepreneurs can navigate resistance from multiple audiences. Our study examines how Tony's Chocolonely, a social enterprise fighting child labor in the chocolate industry, navigated resistance against its “slave‐free” chocolate from diverse audiences. Our study reveals novel insights into how audience resistance shapes entrepreneurs' strategic framing of novel ideas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fraud indicators within the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a major COVID relief program, are highly geographically concentrated. ZIP codes and counties with high rates of suspicious PPP loans are strongly social connected, with evidence that fraud spreads spatially over time through social networks. Individuals in suspicious social media groups have higher rates of PPP fraud, and socially connected ZIP codes frequently use the same specific FinTech lenders, consistent with social networks influencing detailed loan decisions. Our findings suggest that more proactive data analysis is needed for fraud prevention, detection, and prosecution to prevent the social spread of fraudulent schemes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stream SGD: Fast Learning and Valid Inference from Dependent DataMany online optimization problems in operations research rely on data generated by Markovian systems whose dynamics depend on the decision parameters, creating both statistical dependence and biased gradient information. This paper, “Convergence and Inference of Stream Stochastic Gradient Descent, with Applications to Queueing Systems and Inventory Control,” develops a unified theory for stream stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a sample-efficient method that uses just one observation per iteration. Using Poisson-equation techniques, the authors quantify and control gradient bias and dependence, proving an optimal [Formula: see text] convergence rate and a state-of-the-art O(log T) regret bound. Beyond optimization performance, the paper introduces an online inference framework for uncertainty quantification and establishes a functional central limit theorem that underpins valid asymptotic inference. A new Wasserstein-type divergence yields verifiable conditions via coupling arguments tailored to operations research models. Applications to queueing and inventory problems demonstrate how the theory translates into practical, scalable algorithms.</content>

    <title>The Ebbs and Flows of Reputation as Meaningful Signals: Market Reactions to Firms’ Reputation Instability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While prior studies typically treat firm reputation as a stable, intangible resource reflecting cumulative competence, we extend a socio‐constructionist perspective by shifting the focus toreputation instability– erratic fluctuations in a firm’s reputation over time relative to its industry peers. We argue that reputation instability functions as a distinct and often overlooked market signal by introducing ambiguities that influence investor valuation of a firm in a stock market context. Crucially, the impact of reputation instability is further shaped by contextual cues that anchor investor expectations. A firm’scurrent reputationandindustry dynamismcondition how instability may be regarded, either as a warning sign or a potential indication of improvement. Using panel data across four major US industry groups over 21 years, we find evidence consistent with our theoretical framework and identify critical boundary conditions under which reputation instability is penalized or rewarded by the market. By reframing reputation as a dynamic and unstable construct, our study advances theory on reputation signals, offering novel insights into how reputational temporal dynamics – not just established levels – shape firms’ market outcomes.</content>

    <title>Trapped in the MNE matrix: liminal identity at the local–corporate–global nexus</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers’ identities in large matrixed MNE structures are complex and pliable. While research has examined the identities of individual actors located in headquarters (HQ) or local subsidiaries, the unique identity challenges faced by those operating outside these conventional units are less predictable. Our study explores how managers experience and manage a ‘liminal identity’—feeling ‘betwixt and between’ multiple identity positions. Focusing on US MNEs in the life sciences sector, we interviewed managers who assumed global responsibilities from corporate HQ while remaining situated in their local (Irish) subsidiary. We find that operating between corporate HQ, a global network, and the local subsidiary forged a liminal identity. Straddling this local–corporate–global nexus was a profoundly ambiguous, precarious, and destabilizing experience. Yet, individuals also sought to leverage their liminal identity by adopting multiple identities, depending on the audience. This involved ‘switching’ between renouncing a local identity, assimilating a corporate identity and co-constructing a global identity. However, this produced an intense identity struggle, eroding a clear sense of self and belonging. Our study cautions firms to be attentive when supporting managers in these ‘in-between’ spaces to avoid the trap of ‘identity limbo’, where individuals risk becoming disconnected and isolated.</content>

    <title>From decision patience to process patience: A decision–process integration of the choice to wait and the experience of waiting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer impatience has long been examined through the lens of intertemporal choice, where patience is inferred from decisions to accept delayed rewards. Yet, this conceptualization captures only thechoiceto wait, not theexperienceof waiting. Sweeny's Process Model of Patience (PMP) shifts the focus from temporal preferences to temporal affect, defining impatience as a negatively valenced emotional response to objectionable delays and patience as the active regulation of this emotion. In this commentary, I bridge these two traditions by mapping the psychological drivers of intertemporal choice—affective urges, cognitive representations, construal, subjective time perception, and future‐self connectedness—onto the mechanisms that shape waiting experiences. This decision–process integration of impatience reveals where the two perspectives converge, where they diverge, and why these distinctions matter for understanding consumer behavior. I propose several testable predictions illustrating how choice patience and process patience dissociate, how motivations and mental representations shift across the decision–waiting timeline, and how environmental cues can reduce uncertainty at choice yet heighten impatience during the wait. Together, these insights suggest a more complete temporal model of impatience—one that begins before the decision is made and continues throughout the delay that follows.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship accelerators are increasingly promoted as structural interventions to close gender gaps, yet studies have not established a differential impact of participation for women. This prior evidence—drawn from high‐tech, male‐dominated settings—may overlook how outcomes differ in more feminized domains such as social innovation. Using unique multi‐level data from 1417 ventures applying to 33 accelerators, we examine whether average effects conceal variation across institutional environments and program designs. We find that in more gender‐egalitarian countries, women‐led ventures performed better than peers after participating, especially in programs aiming to support women. In less egalitarian environments, however, participation offered negative or no such advantages even in gender supportive programs. These results suggest that well‐intended interventions to advance women entrepreneurs are context‐dependent and may sometimes reinforce the very disparities they intended to diminish.Managerial SummarySocial innovation accelerators are often championed as a way to help women entrepreneurs thrive. But our analysis of 1417 ventures applying to 33 programs shows that results vary—and context matters. In more egalitarian countries, participation is associated with improved performance for women‐led ventures, especially when programs are explicitly designed to support them. Surprisingly, the pattern flips in less egalitarian environments: women founders who join even women‐focused programs often see no performance gains—or even declines—relative to peers. These findings suggest that well‐intentioned support can backfire if it doesn't fit the local institutional environment. For program designers and leaders, this is a call to move beyond one‐size‐fits‐all approaches and carefully align equity goals with the realities of the ecosystems they operate in.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a panel of 2688 city‐year observations of German fintech ventures and entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), we examine how ESO presence relates to venture entry. We argue and demonstrate that this relationship is contingent on local founding conditions. We find that ESO presence is most strongly associated with entry in thin ecosystems, while this association weakens in more active and developed contexts. Patterns in entries of non‐supported versus ESO‐supported ventures, along with differences across ESO types, support our argument that primarily ecosystem‐level bridging mechanisms, such as legitimacy diffusion, knowledge spillovers, and access to relational networks, are sensitive to local conditions, whereas direct support provided by ESOs to program participants is not context‐dependent.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs, entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), and ecosystem builders benefit from understanding the broader economic and entrepreneurial context. In well‐developed ecosystems, informal networks can provide access to knowledge, collaboration opportunities, and legitimacy signals, reducing the marginal contribution of additional ESO presence in the ecosystem. In less‐developed ecosystems, ESOs can support venture formation by bridging entrepreneurs to networks, partners, and markets, and by mitigating resource scarcity and the challenges of newness. Structured programs, targeted mentorship, and guidance can support venture entry across the ecosystem, complementing existing informal networks and addressing gaps where they exist. Our findings suggest that the role and potential impact of ESOs vary with local founding conditions, emphasizing the importance of aligning support mechanisms with ecosystem maturity and structural characteristics.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint or Independent? Sourcing and Inspection Decisions in Emerging Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the presence of supplier quality risk, offering suppliers a higher procurement price or increasing inspection effort are two approaches to motivate a supplier to invest in higher quality. In this paper, we consider three sourcing and inspection strategies for a brand with two branch shops facing supplier quality risk: joint, mixed, and independent strategies. Under the joint strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a uniform procurement price and inspects for both shops in a centralized way (joint sourcing and joint inspection). Under the mixed strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a procurement price and then each shop decides its own inspection probability (joint sourcing and independent inspection). Under the independent strategy, each shop decides its own procurement price and inspection probability (independent sourcing and independent inspection).We find that among the three strategies, the joint strategy mostly relies on the inspection tool to motivate supplier’s high-quality effort, and the mixed strategy mainly utilizes the procurement price tool by offering the highest price for supplier’s high quality.We further find that, no matter the brand is purely profit driven or cares about the quantity of low-quality products sold to the market, the mixed strategy is always preferred to independent strategy. The preference between mixed and joint strategies is jointly determined by the fixed cost incurred in joint sourcing and inspection accuracy. For intermediate fixed cost, if the inspection accuracy is sufficiently high, the mixed strategy is preferred to joint strategy; otherwise, the joint strategy is preferred to the mixed strategy. Interestingly, when a brand becomes more socially responsible (i.e., it cares more about the quantity of lowquality products sold to the market), it may switch from a reliable supplier to a risky supplier, leading to more low-quality products sold to the market. This is because with a greater level of social responsibility, the brand’s higher inspection efforts become more credible, which motivates the risky supplier’s higher quality effort.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain technology holds promise for improving access to financing within supply chains, especially for small and under-financed suppliers. Yet, the specific ways in which blockchain technology mitigates financing frictions and the features that contribute to successful platform implementations remain unclear. Following a theory elaboration approach, we close that gap by studying which financing frictions the BCF solutions aim to address, which blockchain features they use, and the association between the frictions and features. In our analysis, we examine 312 documents with unstructured text describing 11 BCF solutions, both successful and failed. Using AI-based large language models, we identify patterns connecting seven types of financing frictions and three key blockchain features. We find that the transactional friction is the most prominent, despite receiving limited attention in the academic literature, while bankruptcy costs and taxes—frictions that are commonly discussed in the literature—are rarely associated with blockchain features in our sample. Among blockchain features, tokenization is used sparingly; and, unlike other features, it appears in successful BCF solutions only. Moreover, connections between frictions and features are not random: while transactional and hidden actions frictions are linked to all three blockchain features, other frictions are typically associated with only one. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which blockchain adds value in supply chain finance, suggesting that aligning blockchain features with specific frictions may enhance the chances of success. We also demonstrate a method for using AI to evaluate large amounts of unstructured data in operations management research.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Risk Aversion in a Data-Driven Multi-Period Inventory Control Problem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study multi-period risk-averse inventory control in a data-driven setting. In this problem, a risk-averse retailer makes periodic decisions on inventory levels based only on historical demand observations without full knowledge of the demand distribution. We adopt the popular nested formulation for risk-averse programs to formulate this multi-period problem and its data-driven counterpart under a coherent risk measure. Our objective is to study the sample complexity bound such that with high probability, the data-driven policy is near-optimal, i.e., the relative error of risk under the data-driven policy compared with the optimal risk is arbitrarily small. Analysis of this problem is inherently challenging, because the multi-period nature requires solving the risk-averse program and its data-driven version recursively backward in time, while the (empirical) risk-to-go functions in this process do not have closed-form derivatives for most risk measures, which renders existing first-order methods for the risk-neutral newsvendor model invalid. In this study, we develop a zeroth-order framework to establish the complexity bound on sample sizes to guarantee nearoptimality of the data-driven policy with given accuracy levels. Instead of using first-order derivative information on the risk-to-go function, our analysis directly examines the class of functions that underpins each cumulative risk function and derives maximum inequalities for this functional class by computing the covering numbers. Finite-sample complexity bounds are then used to establish asymptotic properties of the estimated risk, including consistency and convergence rate. Computationally, the time complexity for solving the data-driven policy, which is essentially an empirical dynamic programming (EDP) estimator of the optimal policy, increases exponentially in the length of the planning horizon. To speed up computation, we propose an approximation scheme that recursively approximates the empirical cumulative risk function with a convex piecewise linear function and then minimize it to obtain a modified data-driven inventory policy. We show that with proper control for approximation error, the modified data-driven policy is also near-optimal, and it has the same order of sample complexity bound as that for the original EDP policy.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Welfare Implications of Democratization in Content Creation: Generative AI and Beyond</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of content-creation technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has reshaped the way people produce and consume content. These technologies democratize content creation, enabling inexperienced individuals to generate content that rivals the quality produced by professionals. This paper adopts a game-theoretic model to study how the democratization of content creation affects welfare. While the content-democratization technology can assist low-quality creators in improving their content quality, it can precipitate a flood of such content in the market and crowd out high-quality content production, leading to welfare losses. An incremental technology development with low reduction in quality gap can hurt individual consumers and all creators, leading to a lose-lose market outcome. In contrast, a drastic one with high reduction in quality gap benefits individual consumers and all creators, leading to a win-win outcome. Furthermore, when platforms can more effectively screen content and promote high-quality content, welfare rises but the technology is more likely to reduce welfare. The findings help explain the distinct impacts of content democratization in different industries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should firms best communicate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts? Across seven preregistered studies (two large field studies and five online lab experiments), we find that making a series of periodic contributions, e.g., donating $20,000 per month for 12 months, rather than donating an equivalent aggregate amount, e.g., donating $240,000 in a year, improves outcomes for donor companies such as reputation, customer engagement, and purchase likelihood. The benefits of periodic donations arise primarily due to heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation, which affects outcomes in two ways. Via one process pathway, the consistency of periodic donations increases judgments that the donor gave due to authentic prosocial motives, which then increases favorable donor evaluations. Via a second process pathway, heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation also increase the perceived impact of the donation, further boosting favorable donor evaluations. Additional studies demonstrate when and why periodic donations may benefit, or in some cases even harm, evaluations of the donor. Taken together, this research highlights consumers’ sensitivity to cues of consistency, and the importance of perceived authentic prosocial motivation, when consumers grant charitable credit in CSR.</content>

    <title>Whom Should Entrepreneurs Approach? The Effect of Contact Status on Referring New Ventures for Acquisition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior entrepreneurial network literature has primarily examined how entrepreneurs’ networking efforts facilitate interorganizational exchanges, while giving little attention to the agency of their contacts. In this study, we investigate how contacts’ intra‐organizational status shapes their actions of referring entrepreneurs to their organizations for acquisition. Drawing on middle‐status conformity theory and interviews, we argue that, compared to high‐ or low‐status actors, middle‐status actors are more concerned about status loss and face a higher likelihood of such loss; therefore, they have a lower tendency to connect entrepreneurs with their organizations, resulting in a U‐shaped effect of contact status on referring actions including quantity, quality, and efficiency. Furthermore, this U‐shaped effect is moderated by organizational ownership and norms. The results based on 12,103 venture‐acquirer dyads support most of our hypotheses. Our study contributes to the entrepreneurial network literature by identifying the agency of contacts and their specific referring actions. It also adds to the network agency literature by highlighting the organizational context in which the contacts are situated as a critical enabler or inhibitor of such agency. In addition, it enriches the mergers and acquisitions literature by revealing the roles of actors at various organizational levels in facilitating corporate engagement with new ventures.</content>

    <title>Structural Choices at Alliance Formation: Accounting for Partner Asymmetry in Industry Distance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Parties in an alliance aim to capture both common and private benefits. As they transfer and jointly create knowledge to generate common gains, differences in private benefits can arise due to asymmetric knowledge spillovers. Our model of alliance structural choices incorporates the alliance itself—the channel through which partner knowledge flows—to reflect the fact that partners and the alliance may operate in different industry contexts. We propose that partners select structural governance mechanisms (equity governance and alliance scope) to enable valuable knowledge flows while protecting themselves from unwanted spillovers. Analyzing a large sample of U.S. alliances from 1985 to 2024, we find that asymmetric distance predicts these governance choices and that it is linked to the simultaneous use of multiple structural safeguards, including equity governance and a narrow alliance scope.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media have fundamentally reshaped how organizations and audiences interact, challenging theoretical assumptions in the management literature. With this integrative literature review, we take stock of a fragmented body of research, based on an analysis of 647 articles across 9 disciplines. Our synthesis identifies three dominant perspectives: an organization-centric perspective that views social media as tools for strategic action; an audience-centric perspective that emphasizes audience empowerment and contestation; and a platform-centric perspective that highlights how platform features and algorithms condition organizational outcomes and audience interactions. Building on these perspectives, we develop an integrative framework of organizational enablement, audience empowerment, and platform mediation that captures how social media extend and redirect established theories. We distill five major research areas—identity and community, social evaluations, corporate social responsibility, false narratives, and organizational outcome drivers—that capture the core themes of management scholarship to date. Our analysis shows how social media distinctiveness—heightened emotionality, many-to-many diffusion, and expanded actor visibility—has generated theoretical extensions while leaving key debates unresolved. We argue that management research must better integrate across perspectives, expand attention to platform mediation, and incorporate insights from related fields. We conclude with a bold future research agenda for researchers who aim to advance theorizing on organization audience relationships in a complex media ecosystem.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the efficiency of dynamic linked environmental regulation. Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical mechanisms that underpin the benefit—a “firm-wide moral hazard mechanism” and a “correlated targeting mechanism”—and find that a large share of the value of linked regulation is due to the former.</content>

    <title>Education and the Margins of Cyclical Adjustment in the Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Allocative wages—the labor costs considered when deciding to form or dissolve a long-term employment relationship—are more sensitive to cyclical conditions for more educated workers. Specifically, college-educated workers’ allocative wages are highly pro-cyclical, while high school dropouts’ wages exhibit only moderate cyclicality. Further, as education increases, an increasing share of the sensitivity of allocative wages is driven by the persistent scarring effects of the cyclical position at the time of hiring on the wages associated with higher levels of tenure, amounting to more than a third of the overall sensitivity for the college educated. The greater job stability of the more educated—and therefore the exposure to scarring—contributes to these differences. In addition, more significant scarring at each horizon of tenure amplifies the effect. In service of documenting these facts, I develop new methods for inferring the sensitivity of labor costs to shocks when agents are forward-looking and wages may be intertemporally smoothed.</content>

    <title>Automation and Rent Dissipation: Implications for Wages, Inequality, and Productivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of automation in a task-based economy in which some jobs pay workers rents—wages above their outside option. We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents, amplifying wage losses, and reducing within-group wage dispersion in exposed groups. This form of rent dissipation is inefficient and offsets the productivity gains from automation. Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total. Our estimates imply that inefficient rent dissipation has offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation over this period.</content>

    <title>A Theory of How Workers Keep up with Inflation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model that integrates modern theories of labor market flows with nominal wage rigidities to study the consequences of inflation on the labor market. Nominal wage stickiness incentivizes workers to engage in job-to-job transitions after an unexpected increase in the price level. Such dynamics lead to a rise in aggregate vacancies associating a seemingly tight labor market with lower real wages—two facts observed during the recent inflation period. The calibrated model jointly matches aggregate and cross-sectional trends in worker flows and wages during the 2021-2024 period. Using historical data, we show that prior periods of high inflation were also associated with increasing vacancies and upward shifts in the Beveridge curve. Our results suggest that policymakers and academics should be cautious about viewing the rise in the vacancy-to-unemployment rate as a sign of a tight labor market during inflationary periods without holistically looking at other labor market indicators.</content>

    <title>Trajectory Normalizing Work in Unstable Production Environments: When Adapting Production Means Appearing Authentic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations emphasize specific production practices to deal with authenticity pressures, but the practices that signal authenticity to audiences must be continually adapted when production environments are unstable. Changes in the environment can make production practices suddenly infeasible, compelling organizations to perform in different ways the highly visible practices that audiences have come to associate with authenticity. However, authenticity research tends to take the continuity of production practices for granted, focusing on whether certain practices are made visible or not, and leaving unexamined how practices are made legible as they are adapted. Drawing on 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a renowned winery (Cal-Cru), I identify a novel form of authenticity work—trajectory normalizing work—that Cal-Cru’s production team performed internally, out of view from external audiences, to guide production changes. Specifically, the team created contrast cues to inform their actions. They avoided changes that would noticeably alter parts of production visible to audiences, or that clashed with their own understanding of authenticity. Doing so created a reassuring sense among the team that they were departing from audience expectations to sustain, not compromise, the practices that conveyed authenticity. My study highlights the backstage tensions constructing authenticity in unstable production environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies price and liquidity dynamics in the presence of costly short-selling when uninformed traders have limited willingness-to-pay to trade securities. In this setting, unraveling and Bayesian social learning interact to produce a novel mechanism, dynamic unraveling: Unraveling that generates signals that lead to future unraveling. Applying the theory, I show how dynamic unraveling explains low-volume crashes: falls in the prices of securities on low or declining trading volume. In this context, short-selling restrictions can make low-volume crashes more likely by intensifying dynamic unraveling, but liquidity injections have the opposite effect.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02412 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews firms’ financial reports and issues comment letters to ensure compliance with applicable disclosure and accounting requirements. We explore the nature, determinants, and consequences of SEC comment letters that refer to information disclosed in voluntary earnings conference calls. Using hand-collected data, we document that the SEC primarily references these voluntary disclosures to illustrate insufficiencies and, less commonly, inconsistencies in mandatory filings across a wide range of topics. These letters are more likely to be issued when filing reviews are more complex, SEC staff are less resource constrained, and for firms with more institutional investors and analysts. Conference call–related comments tend to occur during higher-quality review processes and require greater remediation costs than other comments. The SEC’s use of call disclosures also leads to more pronounced changes in firms’ subsequent mandatory filings, particularly when the firm indicates agreement with SEC comments. However, we observe a mixed effect on the overall information environment, consistent with possible unintended consequences for the quality of firms’ voluntary disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02065 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humanity – the virtue enabling meaningful human connection – is vital to the leadership we need to survive ourpolycrisiscontext. As a prerequisite to sustainable human community, the virtue of humanity is considered universal. It has been claimed as a ‘higher‐order virtue’, comprised of and enacted by – but irreducible to – a suite of ‘lower‐order virtues’ such as compassion and kindness. This claim is evident in widely‐adopted virtues catalogues, but we lack consensus on how humanity is defined, and which attributes qualify as its virtuous dimensions. To address this, we develop a robust definition of humanity and apply criteria distilled from virtue ethics to theorize the lower‐order virtues that comprise its virtuous dimensions. We thus determine the virtuous dimensions of humanity include empathy, compassion, forgiveness, love, kindness, and generosity. Our processual model illustrates how, when expressed by leaders and followers, these virtuous dimensions represent the fullest expression of the higher‐order virtue of humanity and sustain human community. Our systematic review details what is known empirically about each virtuous dimension of humanity in relation to leadership. Drawing on this, we propose a research agenda to advance understanding of how the virtue of humanity might enable the leadership needed today and into the future.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations today operate in a new information environment, where changing technologies have enabled fundamentally different forms and pathways of information creation and dissemination while also generating unintended consequences – chief among them increased polarization. In combination, the new information environment and polarization have profoundly altered the social processes underpinning social evaluations. To animate social evaluations research on these issues, we consider how information environment shifts and increased polarization affect the value and durability of five social evaluation types – legitimacy, reputation, status, celebrity/infamy, and stigma/esteem. We highlight the implications for both theorizing about and empirically studying social evaluations in an ever more polarized world.</content>

    <title>Marketplace Expansion Through Marquee Seller Adoption: Externalities and Reputation Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the race to establish themselves, many early-stage online marketplaces choose to accelerate their growth by adding marquee (established brand name) sellers. We study the implications of marquee seller entry on smaller, unbranded sellers in a marketplace when both unbranded sellers and marquee sellers can vary vertically across reputation (referred to as sellers’ quality). Although recent literature has shown that higher-quality unbranded sellers fare better than their lower-quality peers, we posit that this may not hold for entrants of any quality. To this end, we collaborate with an online business-to-business platform and exploit the entry of two marquee sellers of vastly differing quality. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework, we causally identify the effect. We find that, although higher-quality unbranded seller revenues increase relative to low-quality unbranded sellers when the entrant is of superior quality (consistent with the literature), the effect is reversed when the entrant is of inferior quality. Further, unbranded sellers change their supply quantities such that the platform’s average supply quality shifts in the direction of entrant quality. Using a stylized theoretical model, we identify two mechanisms that drive our findings: (i) new buyers brought in by the entrant disproportionately favor unbranded sellers who are quality neighbors to the entrant and (ii) the unbranded seller’s ability to adjust their supply quantities. Most notably, the choice of marquee sellers, examined through the lens of their externality on unbranded sellers, can foster or undermine the platform’s long-term growth objectives.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03606 .</content>

    <title>On the Optimality of Affine Decision Rules in Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose conditions under which two-stage distributionally robust optimization problems are optimally solved in affine or K-adaptable affine decision rules. Contrary to previous work, our conditions do not impose any structure on the support of the uncertain parameters, and they ensure pointwise (as opposed to worst case) optimality of (K-adaptable) affine decision rules. The absence of support restrictions allows us to transfer nonlinearities from the problem description to the support via liftings, whereas the pointwise optimality implies that decision rules remain optimal for broad classes of distributionally robust optimization problems, including data-driven problems over [Formula: see text]-divergence or Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We demonstrate how our conditions can be met in two applications.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [Grant EP/W003317/1].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00053 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a portfolio-independent method to estimate q-theory models, in which parameters are obtained using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to match firm-level stock returns. Our methodology addresses a previous critique on prior studies that model parameters are chosen to fit a specific set of anomalies and different values are needed to fit each anomaly. By targeting the entire sample of firm-level returns and allowing industry and time variations in parameter values, our estimations yield higher correlations between realized and fundamental portfolio returns compared with prior literature. Additionally, the estimated two-capital model generates large and significant size, momentum, profitability, investment, and intangibles premiums, but falls short in explaining the value and accruals anomalies. This limitation underscores the importance of portfolio-independent parameter estimation in evaluating a model’s capability to generate return anomalies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S.

    <title>Spaces for Creativity: Unconventional Workspaces and Divergent Thinking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies are adopting unconventional workspaces—often characterized by bright or oddly colored walls, unique light fixtures, unusual office furniture, vibrant artwork, the display of atypical non–work-related objects, and casual and playful atmospheres—to foster creativity. Yet empirical evidence on the causal effect of such unconventional workspaces on creativity has been lacking. Across four experiments involving a total sample of 1,133 participants, we tested the effect of unconventional workspaces on individuals’ divergent thinking: the process of generating many and distinct ideas to solve a given task. Contrary to our initial expectations, we found that unconventional workspaces did not always boost divergent thinking and even hindered it. Specifically, unconventional workspaces were harmful when solutions for a divergent task could be readily inspired by the workspace’s features because of cognitive anchoring. Hence, the positive effect of unconventional workspaces was significant only when the potential solutions for the divergent-thinking task were unrelated to features of the workspace. These findings provide important evidence of the causal effects of unconventional workspaces on the process of creativity and highlight crucial boundary conditions for such effects.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This research was supported by the Heinrich and Esther Baumann–Steiner Fund for Creativity and Business at INSEAD and the Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation, and Knowledge at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02052 .</content>

    <title>Robust Optimization with Decision-Dependent Information Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust optimization (RO) is a popular paradigm for modeling and solving two- and multistage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. In many real-world applications, such as R&amp;D project selection, production planning, or preference elicitation for product or policy recommendations, the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an often costly investment. Yet, most of the literature on robust optimization assumes that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker’s actions. To fill this gap in the practicability of RO, we consider two- and multistage robust optimization problems in which part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method inspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies for each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each period, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters that were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a finite mixed-integer (resp. bilinear) program if none (resp. some) of the decision variables are real-valued. This finite program is solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach to the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of usability, optimality, and speed on synthetic instances of the Pandora box problem, the preference elicitation problem with real-valued recommendations, the best box problem, and the R&amp;D project portfolio optimization problem. Finally, we evaluate it on an instance of the active preference elicitation problem used to recommend kidney allocation policies to policy-makers at the United Network for Organ Sharing based on real data from the U.S. Kidney Allocation System.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported primarily by the Operations Engineering Program of the National Science Foundation under NSF Award No. 1763108.

    <title>Discrete Choice via Sequential Search</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Essentially every choice involves an information collection or search phase prior to a decision-making phase that culminates in a choice. To study the information collection phase within an important class of search problems and understand how it influences the final choice, we embed an analytically tractable discrete choice model in a classical model of sequential search with perfect recall. Although significant progress has been made in the theory literature in analyzing consumers’ discrete choice behavior using random utility models, discrete choice through a sequential search process has not received enough attention at least in part because of analytical intractability issues. We build on the seminal Pandora’s Problem as a model of sequential search with perfect recall and on Exponomial Choice as a model of discrete choice (with each choice specified by a deterministic or observable utility component minus a random or unobservable utility component following an exponential distribution). We derive the search path and final choice probabilities in closed form, develop all the analytical tools to optimize prices for a given assortment of products, and show that the optimal assortment must contain some number of highest-value products at optimal prices. These results enable joint optimization of assortment and prices efficiently. The structure of the solution features a distinct group of products that are priced just so they remain on the search path with higher probability. Through simulation studies, allowing us to control the ground truth, we also show that our model is competitive against the state of the art in empirical modeling of sequential search and that ignoring sequential search distorts both optimal variety and pricing decisions in an upward direction.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01552 .</content>

    <title>Credible Cheap-Talk Communication of Private Demand Information on Both the Forecast Average and Accuracy</title>
    <updated>2026-02-09T23:51:41+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A canonical setting in supply chain research is one in which a retailer sources a product, under a wholesale price contract, from a manufacturer that invests in capacity in advance of the retailer’s order. When the retailer possesses private information about demand, it is well understood that credible cheap-talk communication is not possible absent considerations of trust or the reactive setting of the wholesale price. This understanding is based on the practice of demand information being shared as a point forecast. Motivated by the fact that some firms are now sharing information on forecast uncertainty along with the mean, we revisit the canonical setting but allow the retailer to communicate its average demand and its forecast accuracy and allow the manufacturer to have multiple sources of capacity. We establish that credible and informative communication emerges in equilibrium under very general conditions. Moreover, when the manufacturer has multiple sources of capacity that differ in reservation and execution costs, the communication can be influential, strictly improve the manufacturer’s expected profit, and result in a Pareto improvement of supply chain profits. Our results suggest that both the forecast average and accuracy should be communicated in a supply chain not only because upstream firms benefit from a quantification of uncertainty but because communicating information about forecast accuracy (in addition to average demand) enhances the credibility of communication. We establish that improvements to the manufacturer’s capacity portfolio (e.g., expansion or cost reduction) can hurt the manufacturer because of an associated reduction in information revelation. This negative effect can occur if the improvement alters or impacts the resource that, in isolation, provides the highest optimal service level.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02726 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of Uncertainty About Future Accounting Standards on Financial Reporting Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial statement preparers frequently trade off the benefit of reporting biased estimates with potential penalties for misreporting. In making this trade-off, preparers often face uncertainty about potential changes to accounting standards (“standard-setting uncertainty”) that could affect the future benefits of biased reporting. Our experiment documents two novel behavioral effects of standard-setting uncertainty on preparers’ estimates. First, standard-setting uncertainty causes preparers to make less biased estimates, even though reduced bias conflicts with their financial incentives in our setting. Second, standard-setting uncertainty increases preparers’ sensitivity to measurement imprecision, which is important for high-quality financial reporting. Although standard-setting uncertainty is often criticized, our theory and results suggest that increased financial reporting quality can be an unanticipated benefit of the uncertainty that naturally arises from a measured and deliberative standard-setting process.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Research funding was provided by The University of Arizona, The University of Texas at Austin, and Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01469 .</content>

    <title>Price Informativeness and Corporate Investment: A Model of Costly Manipulation and Share Repurchases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize how managers can curb manipulation by signaling information via stock repurchases in an environment with costly short selling and feedback effects from trading to firms’ access to capital. Without repurchases, manipulation coexists with informed trading at low shorting costs, reducing price informativeness and firm investment. Manipulation becomes less profitable as shorting costs increase, making prices more informative and boosting investment if speculators are less informed. Incentives to manipulate cease to exist at moderate short selling costs, but making shorting more costly reduces price informativeness and firm investment. Our model shows how contracts that precommit funding and condition future investment on stock prices can induce managers to eliminate manipulation through stock repurchases, facilitating optimal investment policies. An important policy implication is that when stock repurchases are allowed and shorting costs are low, short selling bans will typically reduce investment efficiency.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between the distribution of investor beliefs, the breadth of ownership, and expected returns in a model where stocks differ in the intensity of disagreement and in the extent to which beliefs are polarized, as measured by the number of optimists and pessimists relative to moderates. Polarization explains the size-dependent relationship between breadth and expected returns that we find empirically: positive for large stocks and negative for small stocks. We also find empirical support for the underlying mechanism: polarized stocks earn lower expected returns and are held more broadly if small and less broadly if large.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Comunidad de Madrid [Programa Excelencia para el Profesorado Universitario, Convenio con Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, V Plan Regional de Investigacion Cientifica e Innovacion Tecnologica], the LSE Paul Woolley Centre, and the Spanish National Research Council [Grant PID2019-111358GB-I00].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02027 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large, generalist, technology firms—so-called “big-tech” firms—powerful in their primary market, routinely enter secondary markets consisting of specialist firms. Naturally, one might expect a specialist firm to be fiercely protective of its data as a way to maintain its market position in the secondary market. Counter to this intuition, we demonstrate that a specialist firm willingly shares its market data with an intruding generalist. We do so by developing a model of cross-market competition in which the data collected via consumer usage in one market can improve product quality in another. We show that a specialist firm shares its data to strategically create codependence between the two firms, thereby softening competition and transforming the generalist firm from a traditional competitor into a coopetitor. For the generalist intruder, data from the specialist firm substitute for its own investments in product quality in the secondary market. As such, the act of sharing data makes the generalist a stakeholder in the data collected by the specialist, and consequently in the specialist’s continued success. Moreover, although the firms benefit from data sharing, consumers can be worse off from weakened price competition and lower investments in innovation. Our results have managerial and policy implications, notably on account of backlash against data collection and the market power of big-tech firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: D.

    <title>The Politics of Product Safety: Top Management Team Political Ideology and Serious Medical Product Recalls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing research exploring the influence of executives’ political ideologies on firm strategy, but little is known about how these ideologies influence product quality. Leveraging research that suggests liberal firm leaders prioritize customer safety, whereas conservative firm leaders emphasize firm financial returns, we theorize that a firm’s top management team’s (TMT’s) political ideology influences the number of serious medical product recalls that a firm initiates and how quickly the firm initiates them. Analyzing political donations recorded by the Federal Election Committee from top executives of 88 firms that had 4,072 serious medical product recalls from 2002 through 2015, we find that as firms’ TMTs are more liberal, they issue fewer recalls, but as firms’ TMTs are more conservative, they initiate recalls faster. Results suggest that firms with TMTs one standard deviation more liberal than the mean issue 1.10 fewer recalls per year, but take 22 days longer to initiate them. Findings from a post hoc analysis lend support to our theorizing, as we find that product quality-related adverse events act as a mechanism explaining the relationship between TMT political ideology and recalls. Firms with more liberal TMTs experience fewer product quality-related adverse events, and this reduction in adverse events acts as a mediator to partially explain the reduction in the number of recalls that more liberal firms initiate. Post hoc analyses provide support for an important firm implication; firms with more politically diverse TMTs have fewer recalls, similar to more liberal TMTs, and faster recalls, similar to more conservative TMTs.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03045 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial market regulators have long debated the appropriate frequency of mandatory corporate financial disclosures. Whereas frequent disclosures may help deter overinvestment, they may also encourage short-termism. This paper reports an experiment that examines the effects of varying reporting frequencies on managerial investment decisions. Experimental results indicate that frequent reporting modestly induces short-termism, but it fails to reduce the overinvestment observed in the infrequent reporting regime. Nonbinding communication of intended investment plans does reduce overinvestment, but only in the infrequent reporting regime.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SES 1949112].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01955 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a structural, nominal, life-cycle portfolio choice model with exogenous housing tenure and use shopping costs to generate money demand. Homeowners (renters) with negative (positive) net bond positions react differently to changing inflation risks. The correlation between real bond and real stock returns emerges as the strongest inflation risk quantitatively and generates large increases in stock market demand for homeowners in a 1970s counterfactual. Higher expected inflation encourages stock market participation but affects negatively poorer households without access to that adjustment. A more negative inflation-bond return correlation pushes homeowners more into the stock market, whereas poorer renters move into money.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02007 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information about the number of applicants to a job vacancy might simultaneously signal the degree of competition and vacancy quality. We study how this information affects job search. To do so, we conduct three experiments on a large online job platform in which the treatment varies what information is shown to job seekers. Information about the number of prior applicants to a vacancy increases the number of applications and redirects them to vacancies with few prior applications. Information about vacancy age increases application rates, especially to new vacancies. To further investigate the causal mechanisms, we conduct and analyze a survey choice experiment. We conclude that job seekers prefer to avoid competition rather than use the popularity of a vacancy as a signal of quality.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This research was facilitated through a research consulting agreement between A.

    <title>The Strength of Weak Commitments: A Theory of Price Preannouncements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manufacturers often preannounce reference prices for products that have not yet been produced or even developed. These prices are rarely binding, meaning that the manufacturers can make price adjustments in the future, possibly at a cost. In this paper, we argue that price preannouncements can serve as a weak price commitment that, we find, helps the manufacturers secure better deals from their suppliers, thereby lowering their procurement costs and improving their profit. Surprisingly, even an extremely weak price commitment can substantially improve a manufacturer’s profit. On the other hand, when the price commitment is credible enough, the manufacturer forgoes the price preannouncement. Collectively, these results underscore the strategic effects that price preannouncements can have on firms’ marketing decisions.This paper was accepted by Dmitry Kuksov, marketing.Funding: Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72422007] and the Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee [Grants 11502221 and 16501523] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02020 .</content>

    <title>The Performance Effects of Giving Front-Line Employees Direct Access to Performance Data and Thereby Limiting the Supervisor’s Feedback-Intermediation Role: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2026-02-09T23:51:41+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how giving front-line employees direct access to their performance data affects performance. To explore that impact, we conducted a field experiment at a service organization that made employees’ daily time-use analytics—previously available only to supervisors—simultaneously available to the employees themselves. We find, compared with the preintervention mean value, a significant treatment effect (an 11% decrease) in nonproductive time relative to the control group. That time, however, flows not strictly to productive (revenue-generating) activities but largely to the most convenient outlets, suggesting—as supported by our qualitative evidence—that data transparency on average shifted behavior more toward avoiding nonproductive activities than toward approaching productive activities. (As one participant observed, it led people to “conform, not excel.”) We examine three relational factors we believed, based on prior feedback research, could moderate the performance effect: perceived supervisor support, social comparison orientation, and work motivation type. Performance improvements are greater for employees who perceived their supervisors as less supportive and for those with low intrinsic motivation or high extrinsic motivation; we fail to find a moderating effect of social comparison orientation. Therefore, although we identify the avoidance (although not approach) value of transparent performance data, our results also tell a nuanced story about the supervisor’s optimal role in delivering feedback: The ability to shift people away from “bad” and toward other uses of time depends on the employee’s perception of supervisor quality and the employee’s motivation type.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, organizations.Funding: We are grateful to the Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School and the USC Marshall School of Business for funding this research.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02395 .</content>

    <title>How the Design of Ranking Systems and Ability Affect Physician Effort</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although relative performance feedback in the form of rankings appears to be effective in improving health outcomes, it may have either motivating or demotivating effects for individual physicians. Potential factors influencing such effects include a physician’s ability and the design of the ranking system itself; however, there is limited understanding of these factors. Using a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment with practicing and future physicians as subjects ([Formula: see text]), we systematically analyze effort within small teams under different ranking systems. Exogenously varying the number and position of the thresholds defining the ranking system, we observe that the addition of a threshold to create a new rank is motivating—that is, increases effort—only among individuals capable of exceeding that threshold; the effort of other individuals may remain unchanged or even decrease. In particular, a highly granular ranking system with ranks spanning the entire range of possible outcomes maximizes overall physician effort; high thresholds serve to motivate high-ability individuals, whereas moderate and low thresholds provide opportunities for improvement to lower-ability individuals who cannot reach the high thresholds. Our results suggest that, to motivate their teams effectively, clinical leaders should provide rank feedback using a system under which physicians of all ability types can improve their rank through increased effort.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by C-SEB Center for Social and Economic Behavior at the University of Cologne (Junior Startup Grant No: Rd04-2016-JSUG-Huesmann) and the School of Business and Economics at the University of Münster (Junior Researcher Promotion Fund).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the use of a prevalent but rarely studied form of intellectual property protection: trade secrecy. Building on existing survey evidence of firm-level, cross-sectional use of secrecy, we document the effect of stronger legal protections for trade secrets on the project-level use of such secrets. Our setting is the U.S. oil and gas hydraulic fracturing industry, from 2014 to 2018, in states where firms are required to disclose fracturing fluid ingredients to regulators except for substantiated claims of trade secrets. We examine how the enactment of the federal 2016 Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) affects well-level trade secret use across states with varying levels of pre-DTSA protection. We find substantial increases in the use and novelty of trade secrets. Further, wells with trade secret ingredients are, on average, more productive. However, the DTSA exerts limited additional effect on trade secret–related productivity. Supplementary tests address alternative explanations, show no evidence of intellectual property substitution, and provide additional support that we are capturing policy effects. Our results provide rare empirical evidence on actual trade secret use and enhance our understanding of how appropriability shapes use of trade secrets and associated inventive activity.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01138 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy shocks that increase the costs of public goods should simultaneously reduce voter support for them. We study the extent to which this creates a corresponding voter-induced municipal credit risk. We exploit changes to state and local tax (SALT) deductions from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act as a policy shock to the costs of local public goods. In a difference-in-differences framework with repeated bond trades, we find that jurisdictions with a higher share of residents who ceased deducting SALT (and therefore, face a higher marginal cost of local public goods) experienced a significant increase in municipal bond yields, with an average treatment effect of 8.3 basis points or 3.0% of the unconditional average yield spread. This effect is concentrated in areas where residents have a direct impact on municipal financing decisions via ballot initiatives. This study thus demonstrates the importance of voters in the pricing of public debt and extends the discussion of political and policy uncertainty and therefore, coordination and agency problems to the municipal context.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06072 .</content>

    <title>Reimbursement Policy and Drug Shortages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generic drug shortages have posed significant challenges to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and the government for two decades, causing severe consequences and drawing widespread attention. Substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying the causes, with some linking shortages to Medicare’s adoption of the average sales price (ASP) policy for hospital drug reimbursement. However, little research has captured the connections among reimbursement policies, shortages, and the influence of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which play a key role in representing hospitals to set prices with manufacturers. Recognizing that the reimbursement policy influences shortages through affecting supply chain parties’ decisions, we analyze a drug supply model that captures the essential elements and tradeoffs in drug wholesale price decisions. We find that under the ASP policy, the interplay of two opposing effects, the free-ride effect and the aligning effect, guides wholesale pricing decisions and affects shortage outcomes. We capture key factors influencing these effects and show that the ASP policy actually possesses resistance to shortages of drugs that have experienced shortages. Overcoming the challenges of limited data transparency, especially on GPOs, we further conduct numerical analysis incorporating various data sources (with the aid of machine learning) to gain additional insights. In addition to confirming ASP’s resistance to shortages, the numerical analysis quantitatively investigates the impact of policy and GPO-related parameters. We provide a thorough discussion of policy implications based on our theoretical and numerical findings. Notably, compared with the previously adopted fixed-price reimbursement policy, which we model as a benchmark in our analysis, ASP represents a market-data-driven policy. This distinction underscores the importance of a deep understanding of such policies for future policy evaluation and shortage mitigation.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02223 .</content>

    <title>Learning More Than You Can Know: Introductory Education Produces Overly Expansive Self-Assessments of Knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Education is a primary engine for gaining knowledge, yet it is unclear if introductory education helps learners gain meta-knowledge, that is, an accurate awareness of the scope and limits of their knowledge. We found that after taking an introductory finance class, relative to a control class, students overclaimed more knowledge they did not have, that is, endorsed more familiarity with bogus finance terms and expressed more confidence under incentives in their ability to answer questions about these terms. This finding was replicated in a Psychology and Law class, compared with a control class, with overclaiming still elevated two years later. In two follow-up experiments, participants in a hypothetical consulting context were randomly assigned to introductory training on GPS or a control topic. Participants in the GPS condition overclaimed more knowledge of bogus GPS terms and were more confident in their knowledge of real material never covered in the training, controlling for test performance. These effects were explained by introductory education both increasing self-perceived expertise in the education domain and creating basic schematic understanding that accommodates plausible but incorrect interpretations of unknown content. Introductory education, then, does not necessarily improve learners’ skills at identifying lack of knowledge. Rather, it can lead to an illusion of knowledge for unknown material, causing learners to overestimate their “circle of competence.”This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported in part by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, awarded to S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovation contests incentivize the participants’ to exert effort toward combining (recombining) their existing knowledge to create solutions. In the current work, we consider the case of serial contests, where effort to create solutions for earlier contests can also expand the participant’s knowledge, which can then be valuable in future contests. We develop a novel framework that explicitly includes the generation and utilization of knowledge by participants in knowledge-driven serial innovation contests, and we analyze the implications of this framework for optimal incentive design. Analysis of our model reveals that the efforts expended by participants in a contest can depend on future rewards, especially when learning emerges as a “side effect” of execution effort (i.e., learning while doing). In fact, participants will exert effort in an earlier contest even when its associated reward is zero. In contrast, when explicit knowledge generation effort is feasible (i.e., learning before doing), the contest designer should increase the reward for the earlier contest to prevent participants from postponing their learning. Our model demonstrates that whether one should assign higher reward to the earlier or later contest depends on the mode of learning, the participant pool’s ex ante knowledge, and the transferability of learning from one contest to the next.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03369 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the prevalence of online review creation and solicitation, this paper examines whether posting an online review impacts the reviewer’s future spending on the reviewed brand. Identifying the causal effects of posting an online review is challenging because reviewers self-select into posting, making it an endogenous decision. I overcome this challenge by using randomized online review solicitations as an instrument for the endogenous treatment variable of posting an online review and establish that doing so decreases the average future spending by the reviewers on the reviewed brand. Additionally, I show that soliciting customers to post increases their propensity to write a review and thus in turn reduces their average future spending on the solicited brand. From a managerial standpoint, this finding suggests that online review solicitations can backfire, decreasing the average future spending by solicited customers. I therefore investigate whether the impact of posting (and hence soliciting) is heterogeneous with respect to customer satisfaction and loyalty. At the highest satisfaction level, posting does not change future spending regardless of customer loyalty. However, posting has a detrimental impact on future spending by dissatisfied reviewers. These adverse effects of posting emerge in the most loyal customers as soon as their satisfaction deviates from a perfect score (despite writing a positive review) and carry over to their future spending, even on nonreviewed brands of the company. Based on my findings, I present a set of guidelines for managers to follow when soliciting online reviews and responding to reviewers.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 grant [Grant C207MSS20B006].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01951 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk taking. This is known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion, indicating that MLA’s applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters [Gneezy U, Potters J (1997) An experiment on risk taking and evaluation periods. Quart. J. Econom. 112(2):631–645] to include five key adjustments. These involved downscaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results, which are highly robust to analytical heterogeneity, consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.This paper was accepted by John Beshears, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05720 .</content>

    <title>The Need for Speed: The Impact of Capital Constraints on Strategic Misconduct</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing literature suggests that firms engage in misconduct in response to financial pressure. However, the extent and severity of misconduct have been challenging to determine given the lack of granular data. This limitation is particularly true for smaller firms in emerging markets whose profitability and survival depend on misconduct. This study analyzes the impact of reducing capital constraints on misconduct using high-frequency global positioning system and financing data from the minibus taxi industry in South Africa. I find that lower interest rates, a proxy for lower capital constraints, decrease the most severe forms of misconduct measured by the propensity to speed and crash yet leave more modest forms of misconduct unchanged. Qualitative interviews and survey data suggest that these results are attributable to firms’ efforts to avoid default. These findings contribute to understanding misconduct as a firm strategy when facing financial pressure and suggest that lower capital constraints might improve firm survival and public safety.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01957 .</content>

    <title>Behind the Curtain of Workforce Diversity: Evidence from EEO-1 Reports</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the 2023 court-ordered Freedom of Information Act release of standardized Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) reports to examine the workforce diversity of federal contractors. Using the released data for a sample of more than 19,000 publicly traded and private firms, we provide descriptive evidence on the variation in gender and racial diversity of these companies’ workforce. We also document the existence of a racial gap between managers and lower-level employees. A substantial portion of that gap cannot be explained by industry or geographic factors, reflecting the influence of firm-level characteristics. Then, focusing on a sample of more than 800 publicly traded federal contractors, we find robust evidence that the racial managerial gap is associated with firms’ decision to withhold the voluntary disclosure of their EEO-1 forms. Although our findings are subject to several caveats, we provide important evidence on workforce diversity and highlight the importance of using granular, firm-level data to study diversity topics.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07432 .</content>

    <title>A Primal-Dual Approach to Constrained Markov Decision Processes with Applications to Queue Scheduling and Inventory Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many operations management problems, we need to make decisions sequentially to minimize the cost, satisfying certain constraints. One modeling approach to such problems is the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In this work, we develop a data-driven primal-dual algorithm to solve CMDPs. Our approach alternatively applies regularized policy iteration to improve the policy and subgradient ascent to maintain the constraints. Under mild regularity conditions, we show that the algorithm converges at rate [Formula: see text], where T is the number of iterations, for both the discounted and long-run average cost formulations. Our algorithm can be easily combined with advanced deep learning techniques to deal with complex large-scale problems with the additional benefit of straightforward convergence analysis. When the CMDP has a weakly coupled structure, our approach can further reduce the computational complexity through an embedded decomposition. We apply the algorithm to two operations management problems: multiclass queue scheduling and multiproduct inventory management. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm, when combined with appropriate value function approximations, generates policies that achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art heuristics.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: Y.

    <title>Integrated Fleet and Demand Control for On-Demand Meal Delivery Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show how integrated fleet and demand control can be effectively used to benefit all stakeholders in on-demand restaurant meal delivery. Fleet control—that is, the assignment of orders to couriers—is the main control mechanism to steer delivery operations. Another, mostly overlooked, control mechanism is demand control via display optimization—that is, the ordering of restaurants’ display positions on the meal delivery platform. Based on historical customer interactions with a meal delivery platform, we reveal that display positions have a major effect on customers’ restaurant choices. We then leverage this effect by proposing an integrated, scalable reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously optimizes fleet and demand control. We employ our solution method on simulations of large-scale on-demand meal delivery operations with endogenous customer behavior to derive managerial insights on the value of integrated fleet and demand control. Our results demonstrate that integrated fleet and demand control reduces delays experienced by customers, allows for more services per driver, decreases total travel time per driver, guarantees fresher meals, and provides equal opportunities for all participating restaurants. Our results further highlight that selling display positions may cause operational inflexibility and, therefore, may cause significant delays in the fulfillment process. Finally, we show that careful display optimization not only improves service quality, but also platform revenue.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) [Project 510629371] is gratefully acknowledged.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether investors’ personal experience with climate change affects their voting behavior on climate change–related proposals. We find that fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are significantly more likely to support climate proposals. We further show that the effect is persistent. We observe significant heterogeneity in the effect of hot temperatures, depending on firm-level climate risk, the quality of the proposals, fund investment strategy, and prior awareness of climate change. Fund managers’ personal experience with climate change matters for the outcome of climate proposals as it affects the aggregate support they receive. Fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are also more likely to divest from stocks with greater exposure to climate change.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how collaborator loss affects the individual productivity of knowledge workers in corporate research and development (R&amp;D). Specifically, we argue that the effect of such loss depends on whether the lost collaborator was internal or external to the organization, which may have compensatory measures in place to maintain the continuity of R&amp;D efforts. To empirically investigate the effect of internal and external collaborator loss, we leverage 845 unexpected deaths of active inventors. We find a substantial negative effect on inventive productivity for the loss of external collaborators, particularly when the collaborator was of presumably high relevance to the remaining inventor. In contrast, the effect for the loss of internal collaborators is virtually zero. We show that the organization’s knowledge management and hiring capabilities are instrumental in explaining the muted effect of internal collaborator loss.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grant 329144242 and Collaborative Research Center TRR 190] and the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [Grants CEX2019-000915-S and RYC2022-038012-I].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03045 .</content>

    <title>Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When launching a new product, historical sales data are often not available, leaving price as a crucial experimental instrument for sellers to gauge market response. When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk that, if not controlled, may lead to significant financial losses. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal effect estimation and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design, which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal effect estimation and tail risk control. Moreover, we establish an always-valid confidence sequence and a central limit theorem for the inference of the causal effect. Finally, we extend our results and the design to a misspecified setting, where the structural model is not necessarily linear but the seller still runs our design for linear structural models. The results demonstrate the robustness of our design and the wide existence of the relationships among the three objectives.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: The authors thank the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-IBM partnership in Artificial Intelligence and the MIT Data Science Laboratory for support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03209 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field study of boards’ emerging responsibility to oversee cybersecurity risk, a setting in which few directors have expertise. We find that, although nonexpert directors may genuinely seek to provide diligent oversight, without expertise their efforts lack substance and therefore are mostly symbolic, even when they perform the same oversight activities as expert directors. We also explore why boards do not prioritize the appointment of cybersecurity experts and show that nonexpert directors do not perceive that their efforts are symbolic and insufficient. In contrast, expert directors perceive keenly the deficiency of their nonexpert counterparts and argue for the need for more cybersecurity experts on boards, and this viewpoint is shared by cybersecurity executives and consultants who support the board. Thus, we contribute to our understanding of when boards are likely to provide substantive versus symbolic oversight and inform the debate on the merits of board-level cybersecurity expertise.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by a Security, Privacy, &amp; Trust grant from the Pamplin College of Business and the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative of Virginia.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04147 .</content>

    <title>Uncertain Search with Knowledge Transfer</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a sequential search over a group of similar alternatives. The individual value of an alternative contains two components: an observable utility and an idiosyncratic value. Observable utilities share an unknown population distribution, which captures the similarity across the alternatives and allows for knowledge transfer within the group. Once a decision maker encounters an alternative, its utility is revealed immediately, whereas the idiosyncratic value is unobservable and needs to be learned by sampling. The goal is to select an alternative with the highest individual value, accounting for the sampling and search costs. A novel feature of this problem is the combination of the individual and population levels of learning. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian dynamic program and characterize the optimal policy by a threshold structure. We show that it depends on the difference between the mean estimates of the current alternative and the population. It is optimal to continue sampling if the difference is between a threshold pair; otherwise, accept the current alternative if it exceeds the upper threshold, and switch to a new one if it is below the lower threshold. Other structural properties are also derived to shed light on the effects of the two levels of learning. A key insight is that more uncertainty is preferable at the individual level, but less uncertainty is preferable at the population level. Various practical variants of the problem are also considered.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: W. T.

    <title>Disclosing Low Product Availability: An Online Platform’s Strategy for Mitigating Stockout Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring product availability and successful order fulfillment are critical priorities for any retail company. In this paper, we explore how sharing information about low-availability items (LAIs) can influence customer purchase decisions both in preventing stockouts and mitigating their negative effects. The net impact of sharing information on LAIs is difficult to predict ex ante because multiple effects may act in opposite directions. On the one hand, sharing information could discourage LAI purchases from customers who are averse to stockouts. On the other hand, such information might increase the demand for LAIs because of cognitive biases that make scarce items seem more appealing. In a field experiment with more than 840,000 Instacart customers, we first find that customers are 25% less likely to purchase LAIs when item availability information is disclosed. This effect is not uniform; it is more pronounced when customers shop at new stores, when they have previously encountered lower found rates on the platform, and when they have less experience using the platform. Importantly, LAI disclosure has a positive impact on the platform’s performance in both the short and long term. Specifically, this innovative and extremely low-cost policy results in a 5.8% increase in customer spending and a 5.7% increase in order frequency over the long term. Our analysis suggests that this positive effect is driven by several factors: the improved service quality experienced by customers, as evidenced by a 3.7% reduction in refunds, a 2.9% decrease in product replacements, and a 7.5% reduction in poor product replacement ratings when replacements do occur; increased customer exploration of different stores; and higher spending per order because of fewer refunds and the exploration of potentially more expensive product substitutes. In the context of online retail, a policy of disclosing LAIs can improve customer decision-making by providing stock information, reduce stockouts, enhance satisfaction by managing expectations and transparency, and promote exploration of more platform options.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01808 .</content>

    <title>Monitoring, Performance Reviews, and Retaliation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effects of retaliation on optimal contracts in a hierarchy consisting of a principal, a monitor, and an agent. With probability m, the monitor observes a signal about the agent’s effort and decides what to report to the principal. With probability [Formula: see text], the monitor only observes an uninformative default signal realization. The agent retaliates against the monitor and the principal whenever the monitor’s report reduces the agent’s payment from an endogenously determined default level. We show that the principal’s optimal contracting problem can be divided into two steps: First is an information acquisition stage. The principal chooses how much retaliation to tolerate, and more retaliation generates more informative signals (in the Blackwell sense) about the agent’s effort. Second, given the information acquired, the principal designs the optimal payment schemes, which pool moderately (potentially all) bad agent performances with the uninformative signal realization. The empirical literature documents that supervisors are reluctant to provide poor ratings and that performance reports are often inflated and compressed. We show that such a pattern in performance appraisals can arise as firms’ optimal responses to retaliation concerns.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01226 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The short-selling of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) creates “phantom” ETF shares, trading at market prices, with cash flow rights but no associated voting rights. Unlike regular ETF shares backed by underlying securities, which are voted as directed by the ETF sponsor, phantom ETF shares are typically hedged by the underlying basket as part of market-making activities and result in a significant number of sidelined votes of underlying securities. We find that increases in phantom shares for the corresponding underlying securities are associated with decreases in the number of proxy votes cast and increases in broker nonvotes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01567 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity in the context of taxi drivers. The AI we study assists drivers with finding customers by suggesting routes along which the demand is predicted to be high. We find that AI improves drivers’ productivity by shortening the cruising time, and this gain is accrued only to low-skilled drivers, narrowing the productivity gap between high- and low-skilled drivers by 13.4%. This case study provides evidence that AI and skill are indeed substitutes, offering direct support for the underlying assumption of recent projection exercises regarding job displacement by AI.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [Grants 23K25495, 23H00828, 22H00847, 22H05009, and 22H00057], JST RISTEX [Grant JPMJRX18H3], and JST ERATO [Grant JPMJER2301].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01631 .</content>

    <title>How Borrowers Respond to Dynamic Incentives? An Exploration of Repayment Decisions on Digital Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how borrowers in digital credit markets respond to dynamic incentives. To this end, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in progressive lending policies to identify causal effects on repayment behavior. Our empirical strategy uncovers systematic heterogeneity in borrower responses across different stages of the borrower–lender relationship. We find that first-time borrowers who receive exogenously larger initial loans are significantly more likely to default—consistent with elevated moral hazard and increased repayment burden effects. In contrast, repeat borrowers who receive larger loan increments relative to their prior borrowing cycle exhibit substantially lower default rates. These contrasting patterns are consistent with a theoretical framework where experienced borrowers interpret loan size increases as credible signals of future credit expansion, thereby reinforcing their incentive to maintain repayment discipline. Supporting this mechanism, we document robust evidence of strategic repayment behavior, particularly among borrowers who advance rapidly through successive loan cycles. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of relationship dynamics in shaping borrower behavior and underscore the importance of tailoring progressive lending policies to a borrower’s experience level in order to enhance repayment outcomes across a diverse client base.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02016 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider platform competition when platforms can (1) commercialize users’ data and in return offer their services for free (data-based business model); (2) protect users’ privacy and charge users for participation (subscription-based model); or (3) offer both options (the hybrid model). We find that competition does not always motivate the incumbent platform to protect users’ privacy. When network effects are intermediate, competition can motivate the incumbent to shift from the subscription-based model to the hybrid model, thereby increasing data commercialization. Yet, the opposite case occurs when network effects are weak. Moreover, allowing the incumbent to adopt the hybrid model is welfare enhancing when network effects are strong and welfare reducing (or neutral) otherwise.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Henry Crown Institute, the Eli Hurvitz Institute on Strategic Management, the NET Institute, and the Coller Foundation [Grant 0612017311].Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07744 .</content>

    <title>Last-Iterate Convergence in No-Regret Learning: Games with Reference Effects Under Logit Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work examines the behaviors of the online projected gradient ascent (OPGA) algorithm and its variant in a repeated oligopoly price competition under reference effects. In particular, we consider that multiple firms engage in a multiperiod price competition, where consecutive periods are linked by the reference price update and each firm has access only to its own first-order feedback. Consumers assess their willingness to pay by comparing the current price against the memory-based reference price, and their choices follow the multinomial logit (MNL) model. We use the notion of stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE), defined as the fixed point of the equilibrium pricing policy, to simultaneously capture the long-run equilibrium and stability. We first study the loss-neutral reference effects and show that if the firms employ the OPGA algorithm—adjusting the price using the first-order derivatives of their log-revenues—the price and reference price paths attain last-iterate convergence to the unique SNE, thereby guaranteeing the no-regret learning and market stability. Moreover, with appropriate step-sizes, we prove that this algorithm exhibits a convergence rate of [Formula: see text] in terms of the squared distance and achieves a constant dynamic regret. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, its convergence analysis is challenging due to the model lacking typical properties such as strong monotonicity and variational stability that are ordinarily used for the convergence analysis of online games. The inherent asymmetry nature of reference effects motivates the exploration beyond loss-neutrality. When loss-averse reference effects are introduced, we propose a variant of the original algorithm named the conservative-OPGA (C-OPGA) to handle the nonsmooth revenue functions and show that the price and reference price achieve last-iterate convergence to the set of SNEs with the rate of [Formula: see text]. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality and robustness of OPGA and C-OPGA by theoretically showing that these algorithms can also adapt to firm-differentiated step-sizes and inexact gradients.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: J.

    <title>The Impact of Bank Financing on Borrowers’ Voluntary Disclosures and Real Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how an increase in bank lending affects firms’ investment disclosures and policies. Exploiting the unconventional liquidity injections by the European Central Bank in 2011–2012, we find that U.S. borrowers of European Union (EU) banks receive greater bank financing and issue more management capital expenditure (capex) forecasts following the liquidity injections. In contrast, we find no evidence of changes in bond financing or issuance of management earnings forecasts. We also find that EU banks’ U.S. borrowers on average receive negative market reactions to their capex forecasts and make no change in investment following the liquidity injection. Further, relative to firms with positive feedback, firms with negative feedback have a lower increase in investment but a higher increase in financial assets. Additionally, we find that the effect of increased bank lending on management capex forecasts is more pronounced among banks with weaker financial conditions and among borrowers with greater financial constraints, higher growth volatility, and more informed trading. These findings highlight the important role of capex forecasts in seeking market feedback following increased bank lending and suggest that market feedback helps explain why the transmission of bank credit to corporate investment did not occur following the liquidity injections.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00528 .</content>

    <title>Volatility During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of COVID-19 on market volatility in an equilibrium framework. The model combines beliefs-dependent preferences for economic dynamics and a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) model with unpredictable birth/vaccine events and mitigating policies for disease propagation. The estimated model explains the realized trajectories of the S&amp;P 500 volatility and number of new cases and identifies the source and composition of the volatility spike while providing a good match for 25 unconditional moments of economic series. Beliefs dependence, in conjunction with real effects due to the short-term decline of the effective workforce early in the pandemic, is critical for this comprehensive explanation of short- and long-run properties. A model comparison study is performed. Out-of-sample volatility prediction exercises document that the good in-sample model fit for volatility and cases is not due to over-parametrization. The effects of alternative mitigation policies such as changes in contamination rate, shelter-in-place duration, and shelter-in-place compliance rate are examined. They document the tradeoff in number of cases and stock volatility during the pandemic, and the dominant role of unemployment news volatility.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04352 .</content>

    <title>Content Provision on UGC Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers visiting platforms that host user-generated content (UGC) not only consume content but also generate content by investing time and effort. This paper seeks to examine a UGC platform’s content provision strategy: how a UGC platform can motivate consumers to generate UGC and how it can manage the balance between UGC and the platform’s own content. As UGC and the platform’s own content perform the same function, one may be inclined to think that the two types of content are substitutes. Our analysis shows that they could function as strategic complements. This is because increasing the platform’s own content provision raises the quality of content on the platform, motivates more consumers to join the platform, and increases the total UGC provision on the platform. The public good characteristics of UGC could prompt us to think that UGC provision on the platform will be less than the socially optimal level. Our analysis identifies conditions when the total provision of UGC can be more than the social optimum. One may wonder whether it is profitable for a UGC platform to completely dispense with its own content. We find that it is always profitable for the UGC platform to offer some of its own content. This is because when consumers spend more time consuming the content, the platform can monetize their attention and earn higher ad revenue. Additionally, we find that an increase in ad space on the platform may motivate greater provision of UGC. Finally, we extend the model in several different directions and find that our results are robust.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: W.

    <title>Privacy and Polarization: An Inference-Based Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in behavioral targeting allow media firms to better monetize based on advertising. However, behavioral ad targeting requires consumer tracking, which has heightened privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. We examine how stricter privacy regulations that ban consumer tracking affect media firms’ content strategies and ideological positioning. We consider a model where media firms choose their ideological positioning and advertising, whereas ideologically heterogeneous consumers select their preferred content based on both their ideology and idiosyncratic taste shocks. We compare two salient informational environments: (1) behavioral ad targeting, where perfect inference about consumers is allowed, and (2) contextual ad targeting, where consumer tracking is banned due to privacy regulations, and media firms can only infer consumer types based on their media choice. We show that privacy regulations that ban behavioral ad targeting incentivize media firms to shift toward more extreme and polarizing positioning in order to draw better inferences about consumer types, even though the shift to more extreme ideological positions can hurt both demand and consumer welfare from content consumption. Compared with the monopoly case, competition increases firms’ inference motives and leads to more polarized content over a wider range of parameters due to an inferential complementarity effect arising from consumer self-selection. Our research uncovers a previously unexplored relationship between privacy and polarization, shedding light on the potential unintended consequences of privacy regulations in media markets.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the NET Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06054 .</content>

    <title>“I Hold On”: How Country Music Songwriters Cope With the Precarity of Craft Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We find that the key to coping with precarity lies in achieving supportive patterns of social embeddedness by investing in primary craft skills, advancing higher-order vocational skills, and navigating the core-periphery structure of the creative craft production system. As apprentice songwriters practice their craft and learn how to organize their songwriting routines, they become increasingly vested in the system. Once they become master songwriters, they broaden their networks by liaising more with other industry stakeholders and engage with the system more reflexively to ensure their continued relevance. Peripheral workers engage in allyship and develop ties with workers positioned at the system’s core. We incorporate these social strategies in a grounded theoretical model capturing how songwriters cope with precarity. We conjecture that elements of the model generalize theoretically towards other corporatized creative craft production systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job positions and appointing females to managerial positions. However, the founder's HR education mitigates these negative effects on both female hiring and managerial appointments, while the founder's HR experience only mitigates the negative effects on female hiring decisions. We also tease out the invoked mechanisms, conduct post hoc tests, and run an extensive number of robustness tests.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the efficiency of self-enforced relational agreements, a common solution to contracting frictions, when sellers have market power and contracts cannot be externally enforced. To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers——that is, same-day facilities——we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency. (JEL D82, D91, G51, I11, I18, L84)</content>

We collected data across thousands of seminars, job market talks, and conference presentations, leveraging human judgment and audio-processing algorithms to measure the number, tone, and type of interruptions. Within a seminar series, women are interrupted more than men. This holds when controlling for characteristics of the presenter, paper, and audience. Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect. (JEL A11, C45, J16, J44)</content>

We revalue New York City office buildings, taking into account both the cash flow and discount rate implications of these shocks, and find a 46 percent decline in long-run value. For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction. Higher-quality buildings were buffered against these trends due to a flight to quality, while lower-quality offices are at risk of becoming a stranded asset. These valuation changes have repercussions for financial stability and local public finances. (JEL E31, E32, G12, J22, M51, R33)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that subjective assessments of employee “potential” contribute to gender gaps in promotion and pay. Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women’s lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping. (JEL J16, J31, J71, L81, M12, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of intensifying competition for contracts in the context of US Defense procurement. Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level. (JEL D12, D31, E12, E21, E32, E52, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the effects of improving public transit infrastructure on city structure and welfare. It develops a quantitative urban model with multiple worker groups and transit modes, and derives a special case yielding sufficient statistics for aggregate welfare in a broad class of models. The paper estimates reduced-form elasticities to implement the approach using data spanning construction of the world’s largest Bus Rapid Transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains. Accounting for reallocation and general equilibrium effects, distributional impacts are modest. (JEL H76, L92, L98, O18, R42, R53)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly. (JEL F13, F14, G21, L22, L61, L62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reference-dependent preferences can explain several puzzling observations about organizational change. We introduce a dynamic model in which a firm bargains with loss-averse workers about organizational change and wages. We show that change is often stagnant or slow for many periods, followed by a sudden boost in productivity triggered by a crisis. In a crisis, workers concede to organizational change but resist nominal wage reductions. In addition, the model explains why different firms in the same industry often have significant productivity differences. Finally, the model demonstrates the importance of expectations management even if all parties have rational expectations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide quasi-experimental evidence of how an innovative market-based solution using remote-sensing technology can mitigate drought-induced conflict. Droughts are a major driver of conflict in Africa, particularly between transhumant pastoralists and sedentary farmers. Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) piloted in Kenya provides automated, preemptive payouts to pastoralists affected by droughts. Combining variation in rainfall and the staggered rollout of IBLI in Kenya over the 2000-2020 period, we find that IBLI strongly reduces drought-induced conflict. Key mechanisms include a reduction in herd sizes, as well as income smoothing and asset-price stabilization, contributing to an overall reduced migratory pressure for pastoralists. Our study suggests that market-based solutions are a scalable, cost-effective pathway to mitigate conflict, complementing political solutions such as power-sharing agreements and institutional reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and this results in a higher industry profit but lower consumer surplus. Compared with their absence, loyalty programs decrease both industry profit and consumer welfare, leading to a lose–lose outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that, when the firms are heterogeneous in terms of their network sizes, those with larger networks tend to offer lower rewards yet achieve greater consumer loyalty in contrast to the firms with smaller networks, which compensate with higher rewards.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: T.T.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research reports and earnings conference calls. They also display distinct cognitive and linguistic patterns when discussing E&amp;S issues. Furthermore, female analysts are more likely to issue lower stock recommendations and target prices (lower stock recommendations) following negative E&amp;S discussions in their reports (E&amp;S incidents) than male analysts. Finally, investors respond more strongly to female analysts’ negative tones when discussing E&amp;S issues. Overall, our findings suggest that gender diversity among analysts plays a significant role in shaping corporate E&amp;S practices and provide new insights into the origins of gender differences in skills within the equity analyst profession.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: We acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2022-0285] and the Sauder Exploratory Research Grants Program.

    <title>Managerial actions using historical values for tackling hyper‐competitive environments: The case of Toyota</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides a causal explanation concerning how managerial actions using historical values contribute to dynamic capabilities, or sustaining competitive advantage in changing environments. Based on historical methods that consist mainly of hermeneutics, contextualization, and source criticism, it analyzes sources and data on how Toyota strategically responded to the competitive dynamics of the automotive industry centered around modularization. This resulted in the identification of three types of managerial action using historical values—filtering,integrating, andmodifying—which have a rhetorical influence on the processes of strategic diagnosis, choice, and action respectively in ways that strengthen the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. This enables the firm to adapt to hyper‐competitive environments while maintaining the idiosyncrasies of its core capabilities.Managerial SummaryToyota has sustained its competitive advantage for decades by consistently relying on its core capabilities, especially the Toyota Production System and its longstanding supplier relations. How has Toyota been able to do so while facing rapidly changing environments? This paper seeks to explore this question by comparing Toyota's and Nissan's strategies in response to modularization in the automotive industry in the 1990s and 2000s. It uncovers how a firm's managers can utilize historical values in ways that influence the processes of strategy formation and implementation. This allows the firm to incorporate key elements of new strategies that its rivals introduce in the marketplace alongside the firm's strategies based on its core capabilities, thereby adapting to hyper‐competitive environments while sustaining its idiosyncrasies and competitive advantage.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multiproduct Dynamic Pricing with Popularity Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Popularity bias, reflects the positive impact of popularity information on consumer choices. There are two common display formats for popularity information on online retail platforms: the total-based cumulative sales format, where the total sales of a product are displayed since its launch, and the period-based cumulative sales format, where only sales within a specific recent period are shown. Both types of popularity information are continuously updated. This paper focuses on the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem with popularity bias. We employ the widely used multinomial logit model (MNL) to investigate the impact of popularity bias on consumer choices. In particular, we examine how popularity bias affects marginal revenue, pricing decisions, and market shares. Moreover, we highlight that ignoring popularity bias can lead to a suboptimal outcome. As the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we propose a semi-myopic pricing policy, which is computationally tractable, and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality under both formats. Our numerical simulations further indicate that ignoring popularity bias can result in substantial revenue losses, while the semi-myopic pricing policy consistently outperforms other heuristics under both formats. Finally, empirical tests on real data provide a comprehensive procedure for identifying the most appropriate choice models, which offers practical insights for implementation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Revenue Management with Nonparametric Demand Learning and Product Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product returns are prevalent in practice. Many retailers provide lenient free return policies but with specific return window within which customers are allowed to return products. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider a single-product online learning and pricing problem with stochastic product returns. A salient feature is that the demand function, depending on price and return window decisions, is initially unknown and must be learned on the fly. The retailer thus faces the classic exploration-exploitation trade-off. Moreover, we consider an inventory constraint, introducing an additional trade-off between earning revenue and managing inventory. We propose a modeling framework to integrate pricing and return window decisions, and develop a deterministic fluid model that serves as the full-information benchmark. To tackle the learning problem, we design a novel nonparametric learning algorithm that seamlessly integrates inverse stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods. Under mild assumptions on demand and revenue functions, we establish a regret upper bound for our learning algorithm asO(WTlogT), whereWdenotes the number of return window candidates andTdenotes the time horizon. This result aligns with lower bounds established in both online pricing and multi-armed bandit (MAB) literature. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm across various environments. From an operational standpoint, retailers can use our learning framework as a decision-support tool to identify the optimal price and return window.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We deal with a retailer’s multi-product inventory system where customers randomly seek acceptable substitutes if their initial requests are not satisfied. Unsuccessful quests for substitutes would result in lost sales. Motivated by a consulting project as well as other real practices, we also choose to deal with further challenges posed by initially unknown base demand distributions and substitution probabilities; moreover, we aim to develop an offline learning method that (i) takes advantage of given data derived from bygone decisions rather than of any learning-while-doing opportunity, (ii) makes inferences about base-demand distributions and pairwise substitution probabilities without knowing whether there have been demand arrivals after inventory depletions, and (iii) is unhindered by the lack of knowledge about the assortments faced by customers and their purchase-or-no-purchase decisions at their individual arrivals. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator that circumvents unrealistic data requirements. Our substitution probability estimates employ carefully designed weighting schemes to facilitate rigorous theoretical analysis through tools such as the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Both one-time substitution scenarios and more complex Markov-chain substitution patterns would be accommodated. Using large deviation tools, we establish provably optimal convergence rates of our estimates on top of consistency. The precision in parameter estimates would translate into accuracy in replenishment decisions. For inventory management, we take advantage of a submodularity property to obtain an exact algorithm for the two-product case and a good heuristic for the general multi-product problem. Computational studies based on simulated and actual data confirm the merits of our approach.</content>

    <title>Knowledge Behind Firewalls: How Rivalry Among Alliance Partners Constrains Innovation Inside Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations can gain substantial knowledge synergies from their alliance portfolios, and research suggests firms may benefit even more when their partners compete directly with each other. However, firms can only capture such synergies if their own inventors are allowed to freely exchange knowledge obtained from these partners to create novel combinations. We challenge this premise and argue that, because partners in such configurations are more concerned about the risks of knowledge leakage to their rivals, they will pressure the focal firm into imposing credible safeguards that restrict the access and handling of knowledge inside its organization. We predict that the constraints imposed by these safeguards will be reflected in a higher disconnectedness in the focal firm’s inventor collaboration network, with the extent of these constraints tied to the relative technological bargaining power the focal firm holds over its partners. Importantly, these safeguards are not costless, and we predict that the disconnectedness induced will affect the focal firm’s innovation performance by undermining its ability to create and appropriate inventive value. Using a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms, we find consistent support for these arguments. Our study contributes to research on interfirm alliances, intraorganizational networks, and innovation while offering practical insights for managers.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17230 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Loot Boxes to Better Design: Pricing Randomized ProductsRandomized rewards—often described as “mystery packs” or “blind-box” mechanics—are now a familiar feature in many video games. Yet choosing a loot box’s price and the odds of each possible drop is not just a design decision; it is a challenging optimization problem. In their accepted Operations Research paper, “Algorithms for loot box design” (Han, Ryan, and Tong, forthcoming), the authors develop an algorithmic framework for designing loot boxes by selecting a purchase price and item drop probabilities to maximize expected revenue under player choice behavior. They show that the general problem is computationally hard, but also identify economically motivated restrictions on player utilities that make the design problem tractable. When the number of items is fixed, the paper provides an exact polynomial-time algorithm under one class of utility structures and efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees under another. The analysis also links loot-box design to classic pricing ideas, offering guidance on how to translate item-level values and rarity into transparent, well-performing randomized reward systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using career history data from employees’ online profiles, we provide empirical evidence regarding how human resources systems can affect the gender gap in job tenure. Our results indicate that female workers experience shorter average job tenure than male workers. Our results further show that abandoning forced ranking systems helps to narrow this gender gap. We present experimental evidence indicating that in forced ranking environments, women experience shorter tenure than men and are more likely to exit their roles. This is true even when women are on equal footing with men. Finally, we present survey evidence that under forced ranking systems, more women resign as compared with men. In sum, our empirical, experimental, and survey results indicate that forced ranking systems may contribute to a gender gap in job tenure. Accordingly, abandoning such systems may help promote workplace gender equality.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72472068, 72422022, 72272055, 72321001, 72342009, 72325010, and 72172085], the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Chinese Ministry of Education [Grant 22JZD012], Shenzhen Natural Science Foundation [Grant JCYJ20250604144252069], and Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) Faculty Research Grant [Project No. FRG-25-013-MSB].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03264 .</content>

    <title>The Value of Flexibility from Opaque Selling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An opaque product refers to a subset of products that only differ in some secondary attribute (such as color or style). After a customer purchases an opaque product, one of the products in the subset is then allocated to the customer. Selling opaque products has become popular on e-commerce platforms, because it is a source of flexibility that reduces demand variability and hence inventory cost. In this paper, we seek to understand how the design of opaque product configurations and the fraction of customers choosing opaque products impact the value of flexibility arising from opaque selling. The key finding from our study is the following insight: A modest opaque selling strategy where (i) the opaque options contain small subsets and (ii) only a small fraction of customers buy opaque products achieves substantial cost savings (compared with nonopaque traditional selling). Moreover, the cost savings of this modest opaque strategy is on the same order as a fully flexible scenario where all customers buy an opaque product. Our analysis relies on exploring a novel connection of multiproduct inventory management to the balls-into-bins framework along with a simple balancing policy for opaque selling. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that the simple balancing policy is asymptotically optimal. For extensions outside of our theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that our core insights continue to hold.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 1944428].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2019.02983 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We address the joint assortment and inventory optimization problem for an online retailer facing a set of N substitutable products. The retailer must determine both the assortment and inventories of these products before the start of the selling season to maximize the expected profit. We consider a setting with dynamic SOBS, where consumers’ choices follow the Markov chain choice model. This is a challenging problem, and even computing the expected profit for a given assortment and inventory solution requires solving an intractable dynamic program. We present a sample average approximation-based algorithm for the problem that achieves a regret of [Formula: see text] with respect to an linear program (LP) upper bound. Our algorithm first selects an assortment by balancing the expected revenue (from a single consumer) and the inventory cost. We do this by identifying a subset of products that can pool demand from the universe of substitutable products without significantly cannibalizing the revenue in the presence of dynamic substitution behavior of consumers. We then use a sample average approximation-based LP to decide on the inventory level for each item in the selected assortment. We numerically show that our algorithm considerably improves the performance over standard approaches from the literature on a wide range of instances of the Markov chain choice model and demonstrate that it carefully handles the inventory of products in the long tail (i.e., products with small mean total demand).This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by Amazon [Research Award (V.

    <title>Optimal Contests with Negative Prizes: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the optimal design of contests in the presence of negative prizes and establishes the optimality of a modified all-pay auction with entry fee and reserve. The entry fee always equals the contestants’ liability, and the reserve is weakly higher than in contests without negative prizes. The modification involves awarding all contestants a strictly positive prize if none meet the reserve. This optimal contest better incentivizes high-ability contestants by offering them a higher prize augmented by entry fees, while still ensuring full participation from low-ability contestants. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when contestants’ liability is sufficiently high, the same contest maximizes both the expected total effort and winner’s effort, with both measures increasing with liability. Numerical simulations show that even with low liability, predictions from the two optimal contests are closely aligned. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment comparing optimal contests across different liability levels, confirming the “killing-two-birds-with-one-stone” prediction.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UTS Business School Research Grant, UTS Behavioural Lab Grant and National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72192842, 72203099, 72422018].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03580 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of Online Cart Composition on Cart Abandonment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online shopping cart abandonment is widespread, causing major losses in potential revenues for e-commerce companies. We expand efforts to mitigate cart abandonment by investigating how the cart’s product composition affects abandonment and testing easy-to-implement interventions. We hypothesize that consumers are more likely to abandon carts containing a higher proportion of hedonic relative to utilitarian products. This cart composition effect arises because carts containing higher hedonic-to-utilitarian product ratios are perceived as more hedonic overall, increasing consumer guilt regarding cart purchase, and the likelihood of cart abandonment. Analyses of two large-scale field datasets and four controlled experiments provide converging evidence for the cart composition effect (Studies 1A-3) and the mediating role of perceived hedonism and consumer guilt (Studies 2, 4A, 4B). Substantively, we offer empirical support for a practical and easily implemented intervention: using e-commerce recommendation systems to reduce cart abandonment by suggesting utilitarian items (Studies 4A &amp; 4B). Our findings suggest that recommendation systems may serve as an effective tool for reducing cart abandonment and underscore the importance of incorporating hedonic value considerations into recommendation algorithms. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings for the development of more effective marketing strategies and improving online conversion rates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how partisan alignment between city leaders and state governors shapes information processing and bond pricing in the municipal bond market. Using a novel data set on 1,045 U.S. cities from 2005 to 2019, we show that cities with the same political affiliation as the state governor face 9 basis points lower borrowing costs than misaligned cities. The effect is stronger for riskier bonds, in states where governors hold greater authority, and for fiscally dependent cities. Aligned cities also receive more aid during fiscal distress. Partisan alignment shapes how investors interpret and respond to financial information: Nondisclosure and adverse audit findings raise borrowing costs primarily for misaligned cities, while penalties for aligned cities are markedly smaller.</content>

    <title>Reactions by Actual Data Breach Victims over Time: Evidence from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica Breach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a data breach happens, both victims, whose data were breached, and nonvictims react negatively but not equally so. In this study, we used Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach to identify to what extent reactions of data breach victims go beyond those of nonvictims. Our findings reveal that victims initially lose more trust, feel more violated, feel more strongly that a psychological contract has been breached, feel less belonging on Facebook, and intend to continue using Facebook less. However, these effects are short-lived, disappearing within six months. Intuitively, one might assume that this is because people are locked in on Facebook and are forced to change their attitudes because they cannot change their behavior by leaving it. Surprisingly, a follow-up experiment shows that this is not the case as we found people who are less locked in to improve their attitudes more over time. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that consumers are unable to act when their data are breached and their privacy is violated and that regulation may be needed to better protect data. The short-lived nature of victims’ reactions we identified in this case also raises questions about the role of postbreach compensation in different contexts.</content>

    <title>The power of expressed humility: Early stage investors' reaction to humble entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how entrepreneur‐expressed humility affects early stage investors' willingness to fund new ventures. In pitching contexts where investors rely on relational cues and implicit prototypes of entrepreneurs, we theorize three distinct pathways through which expressed humility shapes funding decisions. First, building on research regarding interpersonal signals in early stage valuation, we propose that humility fosters perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, increasing investors' willingness to fund. Second, drawing on implicit leadership theories, we argue that humility may trigger negative perceptions regarding the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Across a videometric analysis of 140 real‐world pitches and a randomized experiment with French early stage investors, we show that expressed humility elicits both pathways, but investors prioritize positive attributions.Managerial SummaryAlthough humility is often regarded as a positive leadership trait, it contradicts implicit prototypes of successful entrepreneurs, who are typically seen as dominant and assertive. We examine how early stage investors perceive and respond to displays of humility during pitches. We propose that entrepreneur‐expressed humility produces ambiguous effects: It enhances perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, but raises doubts about the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Using a videometric analysis of 140 pitches from the French version ofShark Tankand a randomized experiment with venture capital investors, we find evidence for these competing pathways. Overall, investors prioritize the positive attributions of interpersonal skills, suggesting that entrepreneurs benefit from expressing humility when pitching.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper “Pre-hedging” studies a dealer that pre-hedges an anticipated potential trade and analyses how this affects the client’s overall execution outcome. It shows that pre-hedging can benefit both parties: Improved risk management over an extended horizon then enables the dealer to charge reduced spreads that more than offset any adverse impact the pre-hedging activity has on the execution price. However, when a dealer pre-hedges too aggressively, this can be detrimental to the client. Timing uncertainty of the potential trade is an effective control held by the client to mitigate any counterproductive pre-hedging. Our results are robust to a setting where competing dealers simultaneously pre-hedge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multiasset Optimal Execution via Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic ControlIn “Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic Optimal Control Without Explicit Solution,” Dupret and Hainaut introduce the generalized policy iteration physics-informed neural network, a novel deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems even when the optimal control does not admit explicit solution. The method combines physics-informed neural networks with an actor-critic structure based on generalized policy iteration and uses separate networks to approximate both the value function and the multidimensional optimal control. This approach provides a global approximation of the solution across time and space, enabling fast online evaluation. Theoretical guarantees on convergence and optimality are provided, whereas its accuracy and efficacy are empirically validated through two important numerical examples from operations research. Thereby, the authors generalize the Almgren–Chriss framework arising from optimal execution in finance by allowing both temporary and permanent price impacts to be fully nonlinear and by considering a multidimensional setting with multiple cointegrated assets.</content>

    <title>Network‐Enabled Responses to Deglobalization: Examining How Firms Strategize During Eras of Global Disruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research has shown how cycles of globalization and deglobalization can disrupt firms and networks. Understanding this process requires a historical perspective on how firms and networks coordinate, strategize, and respond to the effects of deglobalization. This paper examines firm‐level, network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization by analysing a selection of key firms operating within the Liverpool (UK) and New York (USA) networks at the turn of the nineteenth century. The case study analyses firms within a broader network structure through network visualization, supplemented by various archival data sources. We explore the strategic responses of multiple firms and demonstrate how the network supported them, enabling them to address the challenges posed by deglobalization. We identify five categories of network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization: reinforcement, adaptation, shared risk, lobbying, and exit.</content>

    <title>Content Exclusivity on Advertising Revenue–Sharing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch rely on third-party providers and share advertising revenue to incentivize content production. Yet, as providers increasingly distribute content across multiple platforms, competition intensifies and platforms consider exclusive contracts to restrict providers’ multihoming behavior. Our research develops an analytical model to examine when exclusive contracts benefit or harm platforms, providers, consumers, and overall welfare. We find that exclusivity has two key forces: it limits the number of providers on each platform, reducing same-side crowding, but it also weakens the effectiveness of revenue sharing as a competitive tool for attracting providers. As a result, exclusivity benefits platforms only when consumers place low marginal value on content, leading platforms to offer lower sharing rates and earn higher profits. When consumer valuation is high, exclusivity can backfire, reducing platform profits. Importantly, exclusivity can increase provider surplus and even generate win–win outcomes for both platforms and providers at intermediate valuation levels. Although exclusivity reduces consumer surplus because of fewer providers, total social welfare may still increase because of reduced competition costs among providers. These findings suggest policymakers should take a nuanced stance toward regulating content exclusivity.</content>

    <title>An Integer Programming Approach for Quick-Commerce Assortment Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the challenge of assortment planning in the context of quick commerce, a rapidly growing business model that aims to deliver time-sensitive products. In order to achieve quick delivery to satisfy the immediate demands of online customers in close proximity, personalized online assortments need to be included in brick-and-mortar store offerings. With the presence of this physical linkage requirement and distinct multinomial logit choice models for online consumer segments, the firm seeks to maximize overall revenue by selecting an optimal assortment of products for local stores and by tailoring a personalized assortment for each online consumer segment. We employ an integer programming approach to solve this NP-hard problem to global optimality. In particular, we derive convex hull results to represent the consumer choice of each online segment under a general class of operational constraints, and to characterize the relation between assortment decisions and choice probabilities of products. Our convex hull results, coupled with a modified choice probability–ordered separation algorithm, yield formulations that provide a significant computational advantage over existing methods. Finally, we illustrate how our convex hull results can be used to address other assortment optimization problems.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ad fraud is increasingly becoming a major concern in online advertising, with publishers being one of the key sources of fraudulent ad traffic. Although ad fraud deterrence is a critical problem from both technical and economic perspectives, past research has not considered their interplay. Our paper fills this critical gap by building a game-theoretic model wherein an ad network (an intermediary between publishers and advertisers) strategically leverages its technological tool (the configuration of a given fraud detection technology) and economic tool (the payment to publishers) to deter ad fraud and maximize profits effectively. Our analysis generates several interesting findings. For example, as the fraud detection technology and fraud generation techniques improve, we show that although the ad network needs to respond by making the technology configuration stricter to dampen fraud motives and admit less ad traffic, it may sometimes need to increase the payment. Furthermore, although many stakeholders advocate instituting strict legislation and policies to reduce malicious publishers, we show that this may sometimes fail to reduce fraud traffic and even hurt an ad network’s profit. In addition, our results provide other useful implications that present a new theoretical perspective on the incentive problems in ad fraud generation and detection. Our study also draws valuable insights for ad networks into implementing effective ad fraud deterrence policies and for advertisers to audit and monitor their ad campaign performance.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: S.

    <title>Matchmaking Strategies for Maximizing Player Engagement in Video Games</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing player engagement is vital to the online gaming industry, given that many games generate revenue through subscription models and microtransactions. We scrutinize engagement management in the prevalent category of competitive video games, where players are frequently matched against one another, and matchmaking systems substantially impact engagement. We propose a dynamic model to analyze player dynamics and optimize matchmaking policies for maximum engagement. Our model takes into account two essential factors in competitive games: heterogeneous skill levels and players’ aversion to losing. Additionally, the model enables us to consider pay-to-win strategies and AI-powered bots, which are contentious methods of influencing player engagement and endogenously affect the optimal matchmaking policy. To provide sharp insights, we analyze a specific case where there are two skill levels, and players churn only after experiencing a losing streak. The optimal matchmaking policy considers both short-term rewards by matching players myopically and long-term rewards by adjusting skill distribution. The pay-to-win system can positively impact player engagement when the majority of players are low-skilled, because adopting pay-to-win also affects skill distribution. This result challenges the conventional wisdom that typically regards pay-to-win as trading player experience for revenue. When incorporating AI-powered bots, we demonstrate that optimizing the matchmaking policy can significantly reduce the number of required bots. We then extend our model and conduct a case study with real data from an online chess platform. The optimal policy can improve engagement by 4%–6% or reduce the percentage of bots by 3% in comparison with skill-based matchmaking.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates credit guarantees in a supply chain setting involving a supplier, a capital-constrained buyer, and a bank. We find that under complete information, credit guarantees increase order quantities but paradoxically raise wholesale prices, overall rendering the credit guarantee not useful for improving the operational efficiency. However, under information asymmetry, either a partial or full guarantee emerges in equilibrium, with the wholesale price maintained at its optimal full-information level. This underscores the pivotal role of credit guarantees in effective signaling and delineates the distinct functions of the wholesale price and the guarantee—the former on operational efficiency and the latter on signaling efficacy. Further comparative analysis of the supplier and buyer performances under the two contract types reveals that credit guarantees do not always benefit both parties.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: H.

    <title>Competition Enforcement and Accounting for Intangible Capital</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Antitrust laws mandate review of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) that exceed an asset size threshold based on accounting standards that exclude most intangible capital. We show that this exclusion leads to thousands of intangible‐intensive M&amp;As being nonreportable. Acquirers in nonreportable deals achieve higher equity values and price markups, especially when consolidating product markets. Furthermore, nonreportable pharmaceutical deals are three times more likely to involve overlapping drug projects, which are subsequently 40% more likely to be terminated. Our results suggest that the growth of intangible assets may exacerbate market power through nonreportable consolidation of the sectors most concerning for consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers struggle to match recommendations to why customers buy. We introduce a practical framework that distinguishes two core, actionable purchase motivations, stable preference and exploratory intent, and present STB, a data-efficient measure that infers which motivation drives each item purchase using only transaction sequences and item attributes. Building on STB, we develop UPSTAR, a motivation-aware recommender that separates users’ behavior into stable-preference and exploratory subsequences and fuses their signals for next-item prediction. Across three real-world e-commerce data sets, UPSTAR substantially improves accuracy and, importantly, advances the system’s ability to surface genuinely exploratory items that drive discovery and cross-category sales. For practitioners, our method enables more targeted marketing: promote reliable items to preference-driven buyers while exposing exploratory buyers to curated novelty, improving conversion and long-term engagement. For platform policy and operations, motivation-aware recommendations support inventory planning, personalized promotions, and responsible diversification of exposure without requiring surveys or extensive auxiliary data. Implementation requires only existing transaction logs and item metadata, making it immediately deployable for large-scale retail systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employee retention, motivation, performance, and well‐being remain enduring priorities in human resource management, yet existing constructs such as engagement, commitment, and satisfaction do not fully capture the depth of emotional attachment that some employees feel towards their jobs. We introduce Love of the Job (LOJ) as a higher‐order form of affective attachment to one's job that integrates passion for one's work, non‐romantic intimacy with coworkers, and commitment to organizational membership, grounded in Sternberg's triangular theory of love. Across a four‐stage, eight‐sample program of research (totalN= 1,801), we develop and validate a concise and reliable LOJ scale using diverse working‐adult samples and longitudinal designs. The measure demonstrates strong psychometric properties and discriminant validity from related constructs, establishing LOJ as a distinct form of work attachment, and shows incremental predictive validity for key outcomes, including discretionary performance, innovation, and job crafting, as well as retention and well‐being indicators such as turnover intentions, partial absenteeism, and work neglect. Together, these findings position LOJ as a novel, theoretically grounded construct with strategic relevance for HRM and provide scholars and practitioners with a robust tool to assess and better understand employees' deep emotional attachment to their work.</content>

    <title>Platform competition and strategic trade‐offs for complementors: Heterogeneous reactions to the entry of a new platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the entry of a rival platform affects the strategies of the incumbent's complementors. The latter face a trade‐off: While the entry threatens their benefits from indirect network effects, it also allows them to escape intense within‐platform competition. Studying Epic Games' entry into the PC video game market—until then dominated by Steam—we show that this trade‐off does not resolve uniformly, driving heterogeneity in strategic reactions. Complementors with weaker strategic resources (independent developers) were more likely to multihome and became less responsive to the incumbent's attempts to orchestrate collective action through platform‐wide sales promotions. In contrast, complementors more reliant on indirect network effects (multiplayer developers) were less likely to multihome and became more responsive to orchestration attempts.Managerial SummaryAs competition between digital platforms intensifies, complementors—firms that provide complementary products or services—must adjust how they engage with platform owners. The entry of a rival platform creates both opportunities and risks: it offers an alternative with less intense competition but also fragments the user base that underpins network benefits. We find that these opposing effects shape complementors' behavior differently. Those with fewer strategic resources are more likely to join the new platform and become less willing to follow the incumbent's coordinated initiatives. In contrast, complementors whose products rely strongly on network effects tend to remain with the incumbent and cooperate more closely with its orchestration efforts. For managers, this highlights that platform competition not only shifts market dynamics but also reshapes the motivations and strategies of heterogeneous complementors.</content>

    <title>When Overconfident CEOs Deliver Higher Returns: Evidence From Acquisition Waves</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfident CEOs are frequently criticized for making value-destroying corporate acquisitions in which they acquire excessively and overpay for their acquisitions. By contrast, we argue that overconfident CEOs can deliver higher returns in acquisition waves because the motivation and the requirement for action speed that occur in acquisition waves are different from other acquisition contexts. Specifically, we hypothesize and find that overconfident CEOs are more likely to capture preemption opportunities by acting earlier in acquisition waves, and such rapid moves enable overconfident CEOs to achieve higher acquisition returns. In addition, drawing upon organizational learning research, we hypothesize and find that in acquisition waves, pre-wave experience with large and related acquisitions facilitates overconfident CEOs to pursue acquisitions even more quickly during acquisition waves, which further enhances acquisition returns. Contributions to the acquisitions and CEO overconfidence literatures are discussed.</content>

    <title>Carbon Pricing versus Green Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Green finance—including environmental, social, and governance investing and sustainable finance regulations—is widespread, but can it substitute for carbon pricing in fighting climate change? In a unified model, I show that (i) when carbon prices reflect the social cost of carbon, green finance should not be used; (ii) when carbon prices are too low, green finance can implement the social optimum if each firm's cost of capital can be set to itssustainable discount rate, which increases with the ratio of carbon emissions to firm value. I provide calibrations, analyze stranded assets, and present implementations through subsidies or preferential financing for green firms.</content>

    <title>Calling It Quits: A Behavioral Perspective on Exploration and Exploitation in R&amp;amp;D Project Termination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not every R&amp;D project will succeed, necessitating a careful selection of which R&amp;D projects to pursue and which to terminate. Timely termination decisions free up scarce resources for more promising projects. Yet, prior research has yielded inconclusive results on how firms terminate exploratory versus exploitative R&amp;D projects. Given that early‐stage R&amp;D project termination is a decision made under high uncertainty, we adopt a behavioral perspective to reconcile the inconsistent findings. We propose that a firm's preference for terminating exploratory versus exploitative projects depends on three sources of contextual feedback: parallel projects, prior collaboration experience, and firm performance. We test our hypotheses using drug development projects from pharmaceutical firms over 11 years, finding that exploratory projects are less likely to be terminated relative to exploitative ones when the number of parallel projects is limited, when they are conducted with an existing partner, or when firm performance falls below aspiration.</content>
