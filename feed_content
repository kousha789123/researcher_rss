    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the efficiency of a market relative to a non-market institution—an auction relative to a quota—as allocation mechanisms in the presence of frictions. We use data from water markets in southeastern Spain and explore a specific change in the institutions to allocate water. On the one hand, frictions arose because poor farmers were liquidity constrained. On the other hand, farmers who were part of the wealthy elite were not liquidity constrained. We estimate a structural dynamic demand model by taking advantage of the fact that water demand for both types of farmers is determined by the technological constraint imposed by the crop's production function. This approach allows us to differentiate liquidity constraints from unobserved heterogeneity. We show that the institutional change from an auction to a quota increased total efficiency for the farmers considered. Welfare increased by 23.4 real pesetas per farmer per tree, a 6 percent increase in total production relative to the market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Family firms are not a homogeneous group. Thus, we theorize and empirically validate how governance differences among family firms (family governance heterogeneity) influence internationalization, considering the home country’s level of family collectivism as a moderator. Drawing on the bifurcation bias approach, we conduct a multilevel meta-analysis on 33,493 family firms. Our findings suggest that family CEOs and greater family involvement on the board hamper internationalization, but family collectivism improves these relationships. In contrast, non-founding generations promote internationalization independently of this country-level moderator. Our study reconciles the theoretical and empirical inconsistencies in the relationship between family governance and family firm internationalization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substantial empirical evidence shows that suppliers in emerging economies can enhance their technological capabilities throughdirectlearning from technologically advanced foreign competitors. However, suppliers in emerging markets may struggle to learn directly from knowledge about competitors’ products that arenotwidely available on the consumer market. We draw on insights from existing literature, explorative interviews, and anecdotal evidence to hypothesize that firms may resort toindirectlearning channels by leveraging downstream customers as knowledge conduits. Using the Chinese manufacturing industry's import data from 2001 to 2015, our quantitative study reveals the innovation premium of such an indirect learning channel that we term as ‘second‐order between‐supplier learning’: suppliers’ technological capabilities improve significantly when they supply to domestic customers who have imported from their technologically more advanced foreign competitors. Through a qualitative study, we develop a theoretical framework to account for the mechanisms underlying this indirect learning channel, outlining themotivations,contents, andcontingenciesthat shape the effectiveness of second‐order between‐supplier learning. Our findings contribute to supply chain management and organizational learning literature by building a theory of second‐order between‐supplier learning. Our findings could also inform suppliers in emerging markets about technological development and guide policymakers on cross‐border supply chain management.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A long tradition in macro-finance studies the dynamics of aggregate stock returns and dividends using vector autoregressions, imposing the restrictions implied by the Campbell-Shiller (CS) identity to sharpen inference. We develop Bayesian methods that encode a priori skepticism about return predictability while imposing the restrictions. We highlight that persistence in dividend growth induces “dividend momentum,” a previously overlooked channel for return predictability. By combining Bayesian shrinkage and the CS restrictions, we obtain more plausible degrees of return predictability, superior out-of-sample forecasts, and Sharpe ratios, which cannot be obtained by using either shrinkage or the CS restrictions on their own.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the effect of bond investor demand on the financing and investment decisions of nonfinancial firms using granular data on the bond transactions of insurance companies. Liquidity inflows from insurance premiums combined with insurers’ persistent investment preferences identify bond demand shifts in the secondary market. These raise bond prices and reduce firms’ financing costs. In response, firms issue more bonds, especially when they have well-connected bond underwriters. The proceeds are used for investment activities, particularly by financially constrained firms. My findings emphasize that bond investors significantly affect corporate decisions through their price impact.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow traders to express their willingness to pay for quick execution through a public priority fee bidding mechanism. We provide evidence that high-fee DEX trades are more informative and contribute more to price discovery. Using address-level blockchain transaction data, we show that informed traders persistently bid higher fees to secure early execution, revealing a strong willingness to pay for execution priority. Further, analysis of Ethereum mempool data demonstrates that informed traders employ a “jump bidding” strategy, placing high initial bids to deter potential competitors.</content>

    <title>Patent Term, Innovation, and the Role of Technology Disclosure Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the impact of patent term on R&amp;D and innovation in the presence of policy anticipation, common in real-world settings. Using a difference-in-difference design, I exploit quasi-experimental variation in U.S. patent term across technological fields due to the ratification of TRIPs agreements in 1995. Despite a general increase in average patent term, in most fields innovators faced a considerable probability of patent term reduction for future innovations. Three key findings emerge: (1) R&amp;D and innovation accelerate more in fields with a higher probability of patent term reduction, i.e., a shorter average patent term extension, before implementation. (2) This heightened activity persists for at least five years post-implementation, driven by indirect effects where the news-related acceleration fosters further innovation through technological externalities linked to cumulative knowledge creation. (3) Conversely, the direct effect of a shorter extension in patent term would stimulate relatively less innovation, absent the indirect effects of anticipation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aspirations may condition the future-oriented choices of individuals and thus may play a role in the persistence of poverty or the effort to break out of it. We run a randomised control trial in remote, rural Ethiopia to explore this and evaluate an intervention which aims to change how poor people perceive their future opportunities, alter their aspirations and, through that, modify their investment decisions. A treatment group was shown video documentaries featuring individuals from similar communities who escaped poverty through their own efforts and serve as relatable role models. Five years after the screening took place, the treated households had increased future-oriented investments in agriculture, children’s education and assets. The results can be explained by an increase in aspirations in terms of lifetime goals. Overall, this research uniquely provides evidence that a light-touch behavioural intervention can have persistent economic impacts on a poor population.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: How Frontline Employees’ Relational Communication in Online Service Interactions Drives Customer Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations lose billions of dollars due to inadequate customer service. To improve service, and enhance customer satisfaction, frontline employees’ (FLEs) use of relational communication may be key. During online customer service chats, FLEs provide key information and offer solutions, but they also can build customer relationships through conversations. In this paper, we establish how relational perceptions get evoked in conversations and what influences they have for the outcomes of customer service interactions. Accordingly, we present an empirical field study that illustrates how FLEs influence customer satisfaction by mirroring or complementing four key themes, in line with relational communication theory: intimate communication, task orientation, assertiveness, and composure. Our results indicate that FLEs should mimic customers’ use of intimate communication and task orientation, complement their assertiveness, and exhibit high levels of composure. Moreover, FLEs should emphasize their task orientation at the conversation’s outset, gradually incorporate more intimate communication as it progresses, and adopt assertiveness late in the service chat. These insights, corroborated by four experimental studies, underscore the significance of FLEs’ relational communication. Our findings highlight the value of training FLEs to tailor their word choices adeptly, and leverage the potential benefits of text-monitoring tools which can help FLEs increase relational perceptions and satisfaction among their customers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Don’t Count Non-Targeted Seeding Out Just Yet</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In software markets, the sheer number of available applications makes it rather challenging for any given new one to stand out and be noticed by consumers. Moreover, a push towards privacy by regulators and consumers is making it harder to target consumers. As such, firms have to rely on more non-targeted go-to-market strategies. We explore two popular strategies through which developers can catalyze adoption by helping consumers directly or indirectly learn the value of their products -seeding(free full-feature product giveaways to a subset of the consumer base) andtime-limited freemium(TLF). Seeding, as a business strategy, existed for a long time. On the other hand, the feasibility to offer market-wideTLFbecame mainstream more recently, with the advent of the Internet and a plethora of digital tools. Thus, a natural question emerges - ifTLFrepresents nowadays a feasible and easily implementable strategy for software applications, has seeding approach been rendered irrelevant in these markets? In this study, we provide managerial recommendations on when each of these strategies with a free full-feature consumption component is optimal, based on social and self-learning dynamics, consumer priors, adoption costs, and individual product value depreciation. To that end, under a multi-period parsimonious unifying framework, we show thatSbecomes dominated as free trials enter the picture. We identify two specific market factors that, when present, can induce seeding to be optimal when consumers initially underestimate true product value - (i) user adoption costs and/or (ii) individual depreciation of value by usage. Moreover, we show that these two factors have a moderating effect on the impact of word-of-mouth (WOM) effects on the optimality of seeding. In the absence of these factors, stronger WOM effects alone cannot give seeding an edge against the other business strategies. However, once either depreciation or adoption costs are accounted for, strong WOM effects increase the relevance of seeding (enlarging its optimality region in the parameter space). Our results remain qualitatively consistent under a battery of robustness checks.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Experiences, Experience Gaps, and the Moderating Role of Technology Co-Development in Biotech-Pharma Partnerships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the life sciences industry, pharmaceutical firms often collaborate with biotechnology firms to access technological expertise and R&amp;D capabilities, enabling them to accelerate innovation and bring products to market more effectively. In this study, we examine the collaboration experiences of biotechnology startups and pharmaceutical firms in 287 biotech-pharma partnerships and analyze how firms’ experience impacts the likelihood of product commercialization. Experience is defined as the number of times each firm has participated in supply-based activities in biotech-pharma partnerships. We also conjecture that products developed through biotech-pharma partnerships are more likely to progress toward commercialization if both firms have similar levels of experience. However, when the partnering firms’ experience gap increases and they collaborate to develop the product jointly, we expect progress toward commercialization to become less likely. Our results show that both the biotechnology startup’s experience and the pharmaceutical firm’s experience increase the likelihood of progression toward commercialization. Our results also confirm that co-development moderates the relationship between experience gaps and the progression toward commercialization. Based on our findings, partnering experience and experience gaps are critical considerations as pharmaceutical firms engage in co-development projects with biotechnology startups. By focusing on partnering experience, our study contributes to the technology management literature and research on interfirm partnerships specifically in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Intent-Driven Machine Learning for Fake News Detection: A Referential Domain Adaptation Approach</title>
    <updated>2026-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fake news negatively impacts business operations across various sectors, including healthcare, retail, and finance. One promising way to mitigate this problem is through automated content moderation using machine learning (ML). However, existing methodologies have struggled to identify fake news due to its inherent challenges—namely, class heterogeneity, concept drift, context dependency, and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel strategy that focuses on the heterogeneous intentions behind fake news. Our approach builds on insights from prior social science research indicating that the intent behind creating fake news may differ from that behind disseminating it. This intent-driven variation influences the syntactic structures of fake news, leading to its heterogeneous nature. Accordingly, we argue that developing an ML model focused on the intent dimension of fake news can help overcome the issue of class heterogeneity, which often prevents effective model convergence. Moreover, since intent-driven linguistic patterns are generally less susceptible to temporal shifts and manipulative alterations, we expect this focus to enhance robustness against the other key challenges—concept drift, context dependency, and adversarial attacks. Grounded in a design science approach, we therefore propose a novel ML framework for fake news detection that centers on identifying and leveraging the intent behind fake news. Specifically, we first develop a domain adaptation model to infer the intent behind fake news, specifically targeting contexts where sufficient training data is unavailable—a common limitation in intent detection. Then, based on the intent detection model, we redefine fake news detection by shifting from binary (fake vs. true) to ternary classification (deceptive fake news vs. non-deceptive fake news vs. true news), thereby reducing the computational burden on ML models tasked with processing heterogeneous information within the fake news category. When evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, our approach demonstrated significant improvements in both intent detection and fake news classification. Robustness checks further demonstrate that our method is less sensitive to distributional shifts in data and is more computationally efficient than baselines. Moreover, post-hoc analyses reveal the underlying mechanisms through which incorporating intent into fake news detection enhances model performance, addressing the key challenges associated with fake news.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Supply chain risk and resolution: An empirical study of stock market reactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are exposed to varying levels of supply chain risk and engage in efforts to resolve such risk. This paper examines how disclosures of supply chain risk and resolution during earnings calls affect firms’ stock returns. Using natural language processing, we develop measures of supply chain risk and resolution from quarterly earnings call transcripts for a total of 129,981 firm-quarter observations between 2008 and 2019. We find that higher levels of supply chain risk are associated with lower stock returns around earnings calls, while disclosures of supply chain risk resolution attenuate these negative effects. In particular, stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk quintile are 1.07% lower compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile, and regression analyses indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in supply chain risk is associated with a 0.56% decline in stock returns. The stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk resolution quintile are 0.12% higher compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile. A one-standard-deviation increase in resolution increases stock returns by 0.08%, and to 0.29% for the subsample of observations where the resolution measure is positive. Exploratory analyses indicate that the effect of supply chain risk on stock returns is significantly greater for smaller firms than for larger firms. In addition, when there is evidence that larger firms’ resolution-related statements are mere rhetoric, the effect of resolution on stock returns is diminished.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: First In, First Out? How Debt Age Affects Debt Prepayment Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers often take on debt at different points in time. As a result, debts may be months, if not years, apart in age. In this research, the authors ask whether and how debt age affects installment debt prepayment decisions. While the ideal strategy for prepaying older (vs. newer) debt depends on specific account parameters (e.g., interest rate, monthly payment, etc.), in many circumstances it is financially advantageous to prioritize paying down newer debt. This is because debt amortization (i.e., repayment) schedules often result in reduced interest payments when newer installment debts are paid first. However, across eight studies, including a secondary dataset of consumer loans, the authors find that consumers prefer to prepay older debt first—even when it is financially disadvantageous to do so. The authors term this the “FIFO (first-in-first-out) preference” and demonstrate that consumers prioritize older (vs. newer) debt prepayment because they feel they have invested greater effort (i.e., mental or physical work and energy) to repay it. Accordingly, reducing the effort required to repay an older debt (e.g., through automated payments) or shifting consumers’ focus from invested effort to remaining effort attenuates the FIFO preference. These findings offer implications for theory, managerial practice, and consumer welfare.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Economic Consequences of Risk-Absorption in B2B Relationships: Evidence from Indirect Auto Lending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Risk absorption, where one party assumes risk to support a partner, is common in business-to-business (B2B) relationships but remains underexplored as a form of relationship marketing investment and in its economic consequences. This study investigates risk absorption in the indirect car loan market, where third-party lenders approve loans for high-risk consumers, enabling auto dealers to close sales that might otherwise fall through. Using a three-year dataset from a loan supplier working with 1,550 dealers, the authors examine both the direct costs of risk absorption (e.g., delinquency payments) and the behavioral responses of dealers. They find that dealers often reciprocate by referring more loans after receiving risk absorption, but these referrals tend to carry higher risk, suggesting opportunistic behavior. Dealer responses are heterogeneous: those with higher operational risk exhibit both stronger reciprocity and exploitation. Moreover, reciprocal behavior grows stronger early in the relationship and fades over time, while exploitative tendencies do not vary with relationship length. These findings provide new insight into how risk absorption unfolds across varying dealer profiles in B2B contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that inter-departmental distance between two departments in a store can significantly impact joint (combined) sales of that pair. Using data from blueprints and sales across 64 stores for 52 weeks, along with an experimental study to test our theorizing, we find a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between inter-departmental distance and joint sales. Specifically, close departments are perceived to be substitutes, decreasing the likelihood of buying products from both departments. As distance increases, departments are perceived as somewhat related but different, increasing their diversity and the likelihood of buying from both departments. As distance between departments becomes large and products are seen as unrelated, the likelihood of buying from both departments decreases. This relationship is moderated when departments have non-identical layouts and when there are larger variety differentials across departments. Accordingly, we determine an optimal store layout using BARON solver by maximizing total store revenue. Our results suggest an increase in weekly revenue of about 4.08% for supermarkets (range of -.67% to 9.50%) and 3.20% for hypermarkets (range of .82% to 8.5%). While strategic locations of departments can help retailers increase overall sales, prior empirical work has not studied the impact of distance between departments at the store level.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Economic Inequality Hinders Consumers’ Access to Peer-To-Peer Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms promise openness and access, yet various biases and barriers shape who gets served. This research investigates how regional economic inequality drives access to peer-to-peer services. Using archival, survey, and experimental data across multiple contexts—including lending, lodging, car rental, and tool sharing—the authors provide convergent evidence that heightened economic inequality within a consumer’s geographic region (community, state, or nation) reduces providers’ willingness to serve that consumer when inequality is a salient socioeconomic cue. This decreased willingness constitutes a form of exclusion rooted in providers’ inferences about potential consumers. Thought protocol analyses reveal that providers infer lower socioeconomic status (SES) and diminished trustworthiness among consumers from more unequal regions, thereby increasing perceived financial risk of serving them. Crucially, the authors demonstrate a boundary condition with practical relevance: a strong platform reputation, such as high ratings, can counteract the negative effects of regional economic inequality, restoring access and interpersonal trust in P2P exchanges.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reward-program promotions: How brands can capitalize on retailers’ temporary reward programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a reward-program promotion (RPP), brand manufacturers offer additional stamps or collectibles when their product is bought, which enables consumers to accelerate toward their collection goal in a retailer-led reward program. Such retailer-manufacturer collaboration has become especially popular in the context of temporary reward programs where consumers have limited time to complete their collection. By examining over 800 RPPs across a broad set of categories in 26 reward programs at six Dutch grocery retailers, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of RPPs, which we contrast to regular price promotions. Our results show a clear positive effect of RPPs on brand sales, comparable in size to that of a 21% price discount, and point to program lock-in as likely mechanism of why RPPs work. RPPs work better in programs with a high requirement to complete a collection, in a later stage of the program, and when other brands in the same category participate with RPPs as well. They are less effective, however, when combined with regular price promotions, indicating negative synergies between the two. Importantly, the drivers of RPP effectiveness are largely similar for category and brand sales, highlighting RPPs’ potential for retailer-manufacturer collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many marketers design their product packaging so that when individual units are positioned together, they form a coordinated and often larger image that spans multiple package faces. We coin the term ‘billboarding’ to refer to this practice that blends product packaging and retail display and whose effectiveness remains unexplored in the marketing literature. We document that billboarding improves consumer responses and operates through a combination of heightened artistic perceptions of the brand display and consumer feelings of serendipity. Using an empirical approach that incorporates field data and experiments, we present eight studies that support this perspective. Because marketers are concerned that the improper implementation of billboarding can backfire, we further explore several moderators related to in-store (disorganized and incomplete billboarding) and design (image type) factors to understand how to maximize its utility. We further examine conceptual fluency as a moderator and show that the positive effects of billboarding are significantly weaker when the inclusion of artistic qualities is conceptually less fluent with a product category. This research offers the first examination of an important marketing tool that may help brand managers circumvent uncooperative retailers and advance actionable insights that are likely to boost consumer responses.</content>

    <title>CEO Activism and Corporate Reputation: How Authenticity and CSR Mitigate Stakeholder Misalignment</title>
    <updated>2026-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Lambert Zixin Li, Sarah A. Soule</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research suggests that the effect of CEO activism depends on its alignment with stakeholders’ political ideology. We examine when and why CEO activism can enhance corporate reputation across the ideological spectrum. Integrating signalling theory with a cognitive perspective on reputation formation, we argue that the reputational impact of CEO activism depends on the firm’s corporate social responsibility (CSR), which fosters perceptions of organizational authenticity. Using a national survey and an experiment, we find that CEO activism improves corporate reputation through perceived moral authenticity. This effect is stronger when firms hold B Corp certification, engage in philanthropic donations, or are perceived as more socially responsible. Although stakeholders rate firms as more reputable when their political ideology aligns with the CEO’s activism, this relationship weakens when firms engage in CSR, thereby signalling authenticity. These findings demonstrate how non‐market strategies interact to shape corporate reputation and inform corporate sociopolitical advocacy among heterogeneous audiences.</content>

    <title>Does entrepreneurship narrow the gender earnings gap?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research has examined whether individuals earn greater returns in entrepreneurship than in wage work but has paid little attention to gender differences in these returns. Using Swedish employee–employer data from 1990 to 2020, we compare individuals' earnings before and after they transitioned to entrepreneurship. We find that women founders earn less than men, yet this gap is smaller than in wage employment. Additionally, entrepreneurship yields disproportionately greater returns for (a) high‐ability women facing glass ceilings in salaried positions, and (b) women in male‐typed industries who encounter greater barriers to advancement in wage work. Together, these findings show that entrepreneurship can enable women to realize greater returns to their human capital, particularly when they face stronger constraints in paid employment.Managerial SummaryThis study examines whether entrepreneurship widens or narrows the gender earnings gap compared to wage work. Using comprehensive Swedish data that track individuals before and after founding new businesses, we show that, although women founders earn less than men in absolute terms, they experience substantially larger earnings gains than men when moving from wage work to entrepreneurship. This advantage is most pronounced for high‐ability women and for women in male‐dominated industries, who face stronger barriers to advancement in salaried work. Our findings indicate that entrepreneurship offers women a pathway to realize greater returns to their skills and experience, yielding disproportionately higher earnings compared to remaining in salaried jobs. For organizations, these results highlight how structural constraints in wage employment can push talented women toward entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Task co‐use and product improvement: An organization design perspective</title>
    <updated>2026-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Co‐using tasks—using the same task to produce more than one product—promises economies of scope. However, task co‐use also ties products together, changing a firm's task network by introducing cross‐product interdependencies. In light of these interdependencies, we identify an unrecognized downside of task co‐use for product reliability: Cross‐product interdependencies complicate task design and increase the risk of malfunctions. Hence, task co‐use may carry a reliability penalty. Second, we propose that the reliability penalty of task co‐use may shrink with experience as cross‐product interdependencies allow for cross‐improvements and therefore potentially higher improvement rates of task co‐using products. We study the US automotive industry and find our predictions supported, indicating that task co‐use is a critical design parameter with important consequences for reliability and product improvement.Managerial SummaryUsing the same tasks to produce multiple products can help firms lower costs and achieve economies of scope. However, this practice also links products more tightly together, creating interdependencies across product lines. These interdependencies can make tasks harder to design and manage, increasing the likelihood of errors or malfunctions. As a result, task co‐use may reduce product reliability—an important but often overlooked drawback. At the same time, co‐used tasks can enable portfolio‐wide improvements— improvements across products. As firms gain experience, problems identified in one product can lead to improvements that benefit others using the same tasks. Over time, these cross‐improvements accelerate product improvement for task co‐using products and can reduce the initial reliability disadvantage. Evidence from the U.S. automotive industry supports these arguments. The findings show that task co‐use is a key design decision that involves meaningful trade‐offs between cost savings, reliability, and improvement. For managers, this highlights the importance of carefully evaluating when and how tasks should be co‐used across products, as these choices have lasting implications for product quality and improvement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that U.S. firms cut imports by 31.8% when their international suppliers experience environmental and social (E&amp;S) incidents. These trade cuts are larger for publicly listed U.S. importers facing high E&amp;S investor pressure and lead to cross-country supplier reallocation, suggesting that E&amp;S preferences in capital markets can be privately costly but have real effects for foreign suppliers. Larger trade cuts around the incident result in better supplier E&amp;S performance in subsequent years and in the eventual resumption of trade. Our results highlight the role of investors in ensuring suppliers’ E&amp;S compliance along global supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does information about the long-run financial costs of reduced labor supply increase mothers’ working hours? We document descriptively that long-term financial factors are not top of mind when mothers decide on their employment level. Moreover, a substantial share of women holds overly optimistic expectations about pension receipt and wage growth under part-time work. In a large-scale field experiment in Switzerland, we randomly assign mothers working part-time as teachers to receive objective information about the long-run costs of reduced labor supply. The treatment increases both demand for financial information and future labor supply plans, in particular among women who underestimate the costs of part-time work. Leveraging linked employer administrative data one year post-intervention, we find that this group of mothers increases working hours by 7 percent. These findings underscore that policies reducing information frictions in labor supply decisions may help address remaining gender gaps in the labor market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) is a potentially important new technology, but its impact on the economy depends on the speed and intensity of adoption. This paper reports results from a series of nationally representative U.S. surveys of genAI use at work and at home. As of late 2024, 45% of the U.S. population age 18–64 uses genAI. Among employed respondents, 27% used genAI for work at least once in the previous week: 10% used it every workday and 17% on some but not all workdays. Relative to each technology’s first mass-market product launch, work adoption of genAI has been faster than the personal computer (PC), and overall adoption has outpaced both PCs and the internet by an even wider margin. Between 1% and 7% of all work hours are currently assisted by genAI, and respondents report time savings equivalent to 1.4% of total work hours. Potential productivity gains vary widely by industry, and firm climate and policies play an important role in adoption patterns.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardello, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Walmart Foundation [Grant 252882].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.02523 .</content>

    <title>Do Consumers Vote with Their Feet in Response to Negative ESG News? Evidence from Foot Traffic to Retail Locations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and, if so, how retail consumers change their shopping in response to firm‐specific negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news. Using an event study methodology, we do not find significant changes in consumer foot traffic in response to negative ESG news, on average. However, the average consumer reacts negatively when such news is covered by national or global media outlets, which elevates consumer awareness. In addition, we provide evidence of the heterogeneity in responses to negative ESG news across consumer groups. Consumers in more ESG‐conscious counties, as measured by county ESG preferences, income, education, and political ideology, reduce store visits in response to negative ESG news. In contrast, consumers in the least ESG‐conscious counties increase their visits in response to negative ESG news. These opposing reactions explain the insignificant average consumer response to negative ESG news. Furthermore, the ESG‐conscious consumers' negative reaction is, at most, modest, dissipating within six weeks. Overall, our findings suggest that firms face divergent responses to ESG activities from different consumer groups, underscoring the divisive nature of ESG issues.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce and validate a novel approach to identifying good managers. In a pre-registered lab experiment, we causally identify managerial contributions by randomly assigning managers to teams and controlling for individual skill. We find that manager contributions are crucial for team success, and that people who self-select into management roles perform worse than randomly assigned managers. Managerial performance is strongly predicted by economic decision-making skill, but not by demographic characteristics. Two validation studies support our experimental results. Participants who succeed in the lab receive more real-world promotions and, in a separate study of retail store managers, skill measures strongly predict store sales. A one standard deviation increase in manager quality increases annual per-store sales by $4.1 million USD (25% increase). Selecting managers on skills rather than demographic characteristics or the desire to lead could substantially improve organizational performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Political embeddedness and family embeddedness are two influential yet distinct areas of entrepreneurship research. In this study, we integrate these two streams of research to focus on family political embeddedness and its implications for new venture creation. Drawing on the social embeddedness perspective and utilizing a longitudinal dataset of 17,084 individuals from the China Family Panel Studies (2014–2022), complemented by 32 qualitative interviews, we examine the relationship between family political embeddedness and entrepreneurial entry, revealing a nuanced interplay. Our theory and related findings reveal a general negative relationship between family political embeddedness and entrepreneurial entry. However, we also unveil an indirect pathway through which family political embeddedness can foster entrepreneurial entry through political news consumption. Finally, we theorize and find that perceived government efficiency strengthens the relationship between political news consumption and entrepreneurial entry. Our work yields important theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using unique, daily, account‐level data, we investigate deposit outflows and inflows in a distressed bank. We observe anoutflowof uninsured depositors following bad regulatory news. Both regular and temporary deposit insurance reduce outflows. We provide important new evidence that, simultaneous with deposit outflows, depositinflowsare first order. Uninsured deposit outflows were largely offset with new insured deposit inflows as the bank approached failure, with the bank increasing term deposit rates. This phenomenon holds in a large sample of banks that faced regulatory action, suggesting that insured deposit inflows are an important mechanism that weakens depositor discipline.</content>

    <title>Model Ambiguity versus Model Misspecification in Dynamic Portfolio Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study aversion to model ambiguity and misspecification in dynamic portfolio choice. Risk‐averse investors (relative risk aversion ) fear return persistence, while risk‐tolerant investors () fear mean reversion, when confronting model misspecification concerns of identically and independently distributed (IID) returns. The intuition is that risk‐averse investors, who want to hedge intertemporally, endogenously fear return persistence, which precludes hedging. A log investor is myopic and unaffected by model misspecification, therefore only worrying about model ambiguity. Our model can generate belief scarring, nonparticipation in equity markets, and extrapolative return expectations. Extending beyond IID returns, we study model misspecification for a mean‐reverting Sharpe ratio.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The link between corporate bond credit spreads and secondary market illiquidity in the cross section has grown stronger since 2005, resulting in a higher liquidity component in credit spreads. Using U.S. investor holdings data, we show that short‐term investors (e.g., mutual funds/exchange‐traded funds [ETFs]) increase trading activities in the secondary market, amplifying the effect of secondary market frictions on prices. We provide a model featuring heterogeneous investors with different trading needs and heterogeneous bonds to investigate the impact of the rapid‐growing mutual fund/ETF sector on the corporate bond market. We find the change in investor composition can quantitatively explain the aggregate trend.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between 2009 and 2011, the Spanish banking system underwent a restructuring process based on savings banks’ consolidation. The program’s design allows us to study how banks’ consolidation affects credit supply and performance. We propose a quasi-experimental analysis showing that bank mergers restrict credit supply and set higher interest rates but also reject fewer applicants and report fewer nonperforming loans. We then estimate a structural model of credit in which banks set interest rates and lending standards. We find that, despite the relaxation in their lending standards, merged banks’ credit performance improved thanks to a significant drop in their screening costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are exposed to varying levels of supply chain risk and engage in efforts to resolve such risk. This paper examines how disclosures of supply chain risk and resolution during earnings calls affect firms’ stock returns. Using natural language processing, we develop measures of supply chain risk and resolution from quarterly earnings call transcripts for a total of 129,981 firm-quarter observations between 2008 and 2019. We find that higher levels of supply chain risk are associated with lower stock returns around earnings calls, while disclosures of supply chain risk resolution attenuate these negative effects. In particular, stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk quintile are 1.07% lower compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile, and regression analyses indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in supply chain risk is associated with a 0.56% decline in stock returns. The stock returns of firms in the highest supply chain risk resolution quintile are 0.12% higher compared to the stock returns of firms in the lowest quintile. A one-standard-deviation increase in resolution increases stock returns by 0.08%, and to 0.29% for the subsample of observations where the resolution measure is positive. Exploratory analyses indicate that the effect of supply chain risk on stock returns is significantly greater for smaller firms than for larger firms. In addition, when there is evidence that larger firms’ resolution-related statements are mere rhetoric, the effect of resolution on stock returns is diminished.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Cross-Platform Spillover Effect of Promotion: Evidence from the PC Game Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform owners employ strategic promotions (e.g., platform-initiated penetration pricing) to enlarge their customer base. Under the conventional price-driven economic logic, such promotions are expected to divert demand for the identical goods away from competing platforms, as extensively documented in the conventional brick-and-mortar store context. However, they can also boost the demand. In environments where customers can easily access the identical goods on competing platforms, the increased awareness by strategic promotion, coupled with other non-price factors, can stimulate the purchases of such goods on competing platforms. As such, the effect of strategic promotions on competitive dynamics remains unclear despite their importance for platforms and today’s intensifying platform competition. We utilize the context of online PC game marketplaces where Steam and Epic Games Store dominate. Using the synthetic control approach, our analysis finds that the strategic promotion by Epic Games Store, which offers selected games for free for a week, rather increases the sales of the identical games on Steam substantially (by 59.2%) during that week. In essence, although consumers could obtain the games for free on the promoting platform, more consumers purchased the identical games on the competing platform than before. To comprehensively understand the drivers and conditions of this phenomenon, we perform complementary analysis based on the Attention-Interest-Desire-Action framework, following the progression of consumers’ cross-platform purchase decision process. Using consumer survey and product review data, along with the decomposition of the treatment effect, our results suggest that the effect is more prominent when the price gap between platforms is small and externalities between users or between goods offered by Steam are high. Taken together, our study unveils a unique aspect of strategic promotion in the context of platform competition and highlights the crucial role of externalities in shaping the competitive landscape of digital platforms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Do More Services Lead to Better Buyer-supplier Relationships? The Unintended Consequence of Manufacturing Firms Providing Customer Solutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature has highlighted the value of the solution business model for manufacturing firms. In this research, we investigate the dark side of providing customer solutions and challenge an assumption held by extant research: that shifting from selling individual products to providing customer solutions enhances buyer-supplier relationships. Drawing on the frame problem view and expectation-(dis) confirmation theory, we examine the impact of provision of customer solutions on customer default. We also explore contingent factors that either magnify or mitigate this effect. Using a longitudinal dataset of 2,218 observations from 446 Chinese listed firms between 2012 and 2020, we find that provision of customer solutions increases the likelihood of customer default. Moreover, we show that this positive impact is stronger in industries with higher turbulence and for firms with greater advertising intensity, but weaker for firms with stronger operational capability. These findings suggest that provision of customer solutions can damage buyer-supplier relationships by reducing the likelihood of meeting customer expectations and increasing transaction disputes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the key claims in the paper “Robust Contract Designs: Linear Contracts and Moral Hazard” by Yu and Kong (2020) is proposition 4. This proposition states that when designing the best robust contract—assuming the agent’s utility function is piecewise linear and concave—the optimal solution involves only progressive fixed payments and linear rewards with progressive commission rates. In this note, we provide a clear counterexample backed by a detailed proof to show that this claim is actually incorrect. We further use numerical examples to demonstrate that the contract design suggested by Yu and Kong can perform significantly worse than expected. Lastly, we identify and explain the specific mistakes in their mathematical proofs that led them to this incorrect conclusion.</content>

    <title>How Do Taxes Affect the Trading Behavior of Private Investors? Evidence from Individual Portfolio Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The removal of an intertemporal tax discontinuity in Germany provides us with a natural experiment to study the causal effect of taxes on individual stock-trading behavior and the disposition effect. Using individual investor transactions data combined with nonparametric regressions and bunching methods, we find that the presence of the tax discontinuity induces investors to adjust their holding periods, which reduces their effective tax rate by 11.3%. We also find that tax effects dominate the disposition effect in the days around the discontinuity and can inhibit it (by about 20%) during the six months preceding the discontinuity. We discuss the consequences of our results for the firms whose stocks are traded and policy implications.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, more than a quarter of the working-age population experiences physical disabilities that shape workplace participation and career outcomes. Drawing on 168 articles, we synthesize the management literature to develop a unifying framework of focal mechanisms, workplace outcomes, and boundary conditions. In doing so, we offer a clear definition of physical disability, long absent from management research. We also highlight the fragmented theoretical and methodological landscape, in which most studies aggregate disability types, overlooking critical heterogeneity. Our review charts a path forward by identifying key gaps, outlining directions for future scholarship, and emphasizing the need for stronger theoretical grounding and methodological rigor. Finally, we discuss implications for policy and practice, underscoring how greater inclusion of persons with physical disabilities can advance various workplace outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using proprietary transaction‐level data on nonsyndicated construction loans, we provide some of the first empirical evidence on the drivers and consequences of bank monitoring through on‐site inspections.  Banks trade off monitoring intensity with favorable origination terms. Monitoring intensity escalates in response to local economic downturns or the bank's financial instability.  Borrowers with negative inspection reports have more draw requests denied, suggesting that monitoring outcomes impact credit decisions. Both the occurrence and threat of increased inspection frequency correspond to reduced defaults. Overall, our results provide empirical support for a substantial body of theoretical literature on bank monitoring.</content>

    <title>When Family Firm Reputation Backfires: The Role of Controllability in Consumer Responses to Negative CSR Incidents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We apply attribution theory to examine how family ownership status shapes consumer attitudes toward companies after negative corporate social responsibility incidents, focusing on incident controllability. Two longitudinal experiments reveal that, when controllability isunknown, consumers infer lower controllability for family firms and thus hold more favorable attitudes toward them than non-family firms. However, when controllability isknown, low-controllability incidents lead to similar attitudes across firm types, whereas high-controllability incidents reverse the effect, resulting in more negative attitudes toward family firms than non-family firms. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that family firms consistently benefit from their reputation and inform stakeholder communication strategies.</content>

    <title>Inference Based on Time-Varying SVARs Identified with Sign Restrictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for Bayesian inference in TV structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) identified with sign restrictions. The linchpin of our approach is a class of rotation-invariant TV SVARs in which the prior and posterior densities of any sequence of structural parameters belonging to the class are invariant to {orthogonal transformations} of the sequence. Our methodology is new to the literature. In contrast to existing algorithms for inference based on sign restrictions, our algorithm is the first to draw from a uniform distribution over the sequences of orthogonal matrices given the reduced-form parameters. We illustrate our procedure for inference by analyzing the role played by monetary policy during the latest inflation surge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the latest monetary policy tightening cycle, capital has been flowing from low-inflation countries to high-inflation countries. This pattern of capital flows is consistent with the predictions of an open-economy model with nominal rigidities where cost-push shocks generate an inflationary episode and capital flows freely across countries. Yet, by raising demand for domestic non-tradable goods and services, capital inflows cause unwelcome upward pressure on firms’ costs in countries most severely hit by these shocks. We find that a reverse pattern of capital flows would have improved the output-inflation trade-off globally, hence requiring a less aggressive monetary tightening in the most severely hit countries and delivering overall welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Do Financial Advisors Charge Sustainable Investors a Premium?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite growing regulatory concerns about potential overcharging of sustainable investors, empirical evidence is lacking. In two controlled laboratory-in-the-field experiments with 415 professional financial advisors from Europe and the United States and an incentivized survey, we identify two distinct but interacting effects. First, advisors charge sustainable investors a premium. This premium persists even when accounting for differences in skill, effort, and costs. Second, advisors impose higher fees on clients with low financial literacy. These factors interact. Sustainable investors with low financial literacy are charged the highest fee, whereas those with high financial literacy do not pay a sustainability premium. Our findings suggest that advisors extract additional fees for sustainable investment mandates but avoid overcharging sustainable investors with high financial literacy.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice(ETP) is committed to advancing transparency, replicability, credibility, and rigor in research. To support this commitment, we encourage authors to preregister their research plans, submit empirical studies as Registered Reports, and engage with our evolving editorial processes, such as Registered Revisions. Drawing on practices across multiple disciplines, we offer guidance for integrating these publication formats into our field. We also provide multiple resources to support authors in adopting these approaches and to address the unique challenges of applying such formats to, for example, secondary data. By more widely embracing the Registered Report approach, we envision a future for entrepreneurship research that is characterized by greater credibility, replicability, transparency, and scientific impact. In this editorial, we motivate and, hopefully, guide future work by making a specific call for manuscripts for a virtual special issue ofETPfocused on Registered Reports, strengtheningETP’s longstanding commitment to methodological innovation. We offer a prospective vision—what we believe would be good for future literature—and our aim is to empower scholars to proactively shape new theoretical and empirical foundations in entrepreneurship research that enhance the credibility and replicability of entrepreneurship research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transformational leadership is recognized for bringing family members together; however, its role in multi-unit complex family firms that rely on nonfamily managers is poorly theorized. We find that transformational family chief executive officers (CEOs) positively affect the performance of business units run by nonfamily managers, suggesting that transformational family CEOs significantly influence nonfamily managers’ behavior. But the efficacy of that influence matters. Political skill enhances the transformational family CEO’s impact on business unit entrepreneurial orientation and financial performance. Business unit entrepreneurial orientation also mediates the relationship between the transformational family CEO and business unit financial performance, particularly when CEO’s political skill is high.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the rise of institutional ownership has influenced firms' political activities. We find that, after the acquisition of a large stake, a firm's political action committee giving mirrors more closely that of the acquiring investor. Consistent with a causal interpretation, this pattern is also observed for acquisitions driven by new index inclusions. The pattern is stronger when firms' management faces contentious proposals in shareholder meetings and may thus need institutional investors' support. We further show that firms' giving shifts away from business-relevant politicians and is strongly aligned with the individual campaign donations of the institutional investors' employees. These results, together with the finding that the effects are larger for more ``partisan" and privately owned investors, suggest that the influence we uncover is driven by institutional investors' own political views, rather than a profit-maximizing strategy for the portfolio firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms' and executives' stances on controversial issues affect consumer behavior. This “political consumerism” might be motivated by ideology and a desire to signal to peers, and thus vary for private and public purchases. We conduct an experiment with 1198 consumers to study how purchase visibility affects responses to CEO activism. Participants are randomly shown either generic product information or that plus a CEO statement supporting gun rights. They then choose between receiving the product or receiving cash, with half assigned to a condition where their choice is visible to someone they know. We find that CEO activism reduces demand among people who disagree with the CEO regardless of purchase visibility, indicating minimal signaling motives. Our results have implications for firms using politics to differentiate products.Managerial SummaryBusiness leaders who speak out on controversial social and political issues may attract or repel consumers who agree or disagree with their stance. Consumers may react more intensely when others can observe their purchases or boycotts, allowing them to “signal” their beliefs. We experimentally manipulate whether the decision to purchase a product from a firm whose CEO vocally supports gun rights is observable and whether consumers are aware of the CEO's stance. We find that consumers change their behavior in response to CEO political activism regardless of whether their choices are visible to others. This suggests that CEO activism can impel boycotts and that firms can differentiate themselves by taking political positions even when their products are less known or consumed privately.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the efficacy of remote arrangements between CEOs and firms. Such arrangements attract executive talent and overcome labor market segmentation but introduce frictions. Remote arrangements are associated with lower operating performance, firm valuation, and insider reviews. Using the private costs from uprooting the CEO’s spouse as an instrument for the CEO’s decision to seek remote work, we find similar negative effects. The performance decline increases for CEOs who live further away and who cross multiple time zones. The mechanisms include the CEO’s loss of information, short-termism, and consumption of leisure, such as recreational boats and beach homes.

Despite the growing popularity of live streams, little research has examined how liveness may affect viewers’ experiences and behaviors. The current research addresses this gap, and uses the context of amateur music performances to investigate how, when, and why viewing live streams (versus equivalent or identical pre-recorded video) can enhance presence, connection, enjoyment, and engagement. We find evidence of amere liveness effecton consumer experiences: simply knowing that an online video stream is live causes viewers to feel more connected to streamers. This effect is facilitated by an elevated sense of presence, or “being there,” in events that are viewed in real time. Critically, this effect also drives aliveness liftfor online streamers; viewers of live (versus pre-recorded) streams enjoy the content more, choose to continue watching longer, and are more willing to follow and subscribe to the streamers’ channels. These findings have clear substantive implications: marketers, platform developers, and content creators can enhance consumer connection, enjoyment, and engagement by going live.</content>

    <title>Corporate Tax System Complexity and Investment Sensitivity to Tax Policy Changes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective policymakers must balance the demands of formulating a corporate tax system that raises revenue and spurs economic activity (e.g., investment) while promoting a “level playing field” across firms. Balancing these tradeoffs has likely caused tax systems to become more complex over time, increasing firms’ difficulty in understanding and complying with tax regulations. We investigate the impact of tax system complexity on the responsiveness of firm‐level investment to tax policy changes. Exploiting staggered tax rate changes and variation in tax system complexity across countries, we document two key findings. First, firm‐level investment is less sensitive to changes in the corporate tax rate when tax system complexity is higher, suggesting that such complexity can undermine the ability of tax policy to affect economic growth. Second, the impact of tax complexity on the sensitivity of investment to tax rate changes varies significantly across firms, with domestic‐owned, smaller, and private firms being more affected. These cross‐sectional disparities are consistent with tax system complexity potentially reducing tax system parity. Collectively, our findings suggest that corporate tax system complexity can negatively impact the ability of fiscal policy to affect investment and lead to heterogeneous tax policy responses across firms.</content>

    <title>Searching together versus searching apart: Evidence from Kaggle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the mode of search—independently or jointly—affect collective search, a central component of organizational adaptation and innovation? Using naturally occurring data from a strongly incentivized online competition platform, we find that compared to their counterfactuals that search apart, groups searching together exhibit less exploration in their search outcomes as noted in prior experimental and computational modeling studies. However, groups searching together stimulate a greater number of search attempts from their members than groups searching apart, an effect that has so far remained unnoticed. Further, both search attempts and exploration contribute positively to search performance. This suggests that the choice of search mode should depend on the demands of strategic contexts that make either the variety or volume of solutions relatively more important for collective search.Managerial SummaryHow members of a team interact when looking for solutions to problems shapes their success. Using evidence from online machine learning competitions, we find that looking for solutions together encourages members to examing more alternatives but narrows the range of these ideas, while working independently generates greater variety but fewer alternatives being examined. We propose that the choice between the two depends on context. When innovation requires novel, distinctive solutions, as in early‐stage R&amp;D, independent work may be more effective. When speed and volume matter, as in patent races or crowded digital markets, searching for solutions together delivers faster iteration. Managers can improve innovation outcomes by aligning the mode of teamwork with the strategic demands of the problem.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the impact of perceived cancer risk on housing values using widely advertised national reclassifications of chemical carcinogenicity in the United States. Combining these information events with an empirical design that compares changes in house values closer to affected toxic plants against those farther away isolates the effect of cancer risk news from other local factors. Focusing on plants previously emitting reclassified carcinogenic chemicals, we estimate a 1–2% decline in housing values within a 3-mile radius compared to those located farther away. The effects are stronger in areas with higher media presence underscoring the role of salience as a mechanism.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multichannel Experience, Product Attributes, and Consumer Return Behavior: An Empirical Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Omnichannel retailing has changed the way consumers shop, yet product returns remain a costly challenge. Conventional wisdom holds that adding sales channels provides better information about product fit and should help reduce returns. However, it is unclear how shopping experience across multiple channels influences what consumers buy and whether they return those purchases. There is also no clear consensus on why return rates increase in some omnichannel contexts but not others. We address this knowledge gap by focusing on consumers’ multichannel experience (MX) rather than mere channel adoption, and distinguishing two types of MX:remote-only(those who have used only non-physical channels like online and catalog) versushybrid(those who have used both non-physical and physical channels). We empirically analyze over 292,000 transactions from a European furniture retailer operating showroom, online, and catalog channels. Using a series of fixed-effects regressions with Heckman selection to address potential channel-selection bias, a control function approach to account for endogeneity due to omitted variable bias associated with MX, and a parallel mediation analysis, we find that consumers with MX are significantly more likely to return products than their counterparts with only single-channel experience (SX) (i.e., showroom, online, or catalog). This elevated return propensity is largely driven by MX shoppers’ greater tendency to buy niche products and experience goods, which carry higher uncertainty and return risk. Moreover, consumers with remote-only MX exhibit higher return rates than those with hybrid MX, and this gap is especially pronounced among consumers living farther from a physical showroom store. We conduct multiple robustness checks to verify the results. We also replicate the main findings with a new transaction data set from a U.S. retailer (leveraging a natural experiment). Theoretically, our work challenges assumptions that multichannel access inherently lowers returns, highlighting how MX can increase return risk through its effect on purchase behavior. Managerially, our findings inform product–channel matching strategies and omnichannel design, and point to targeted interventions based on consumer type (remote-only vs. hybrid) and geography (distance to stores) to ameliorate returns.</content>

    <title>These Are My (Micro)Confessions: An Episodic Theory of Employee Microconfessions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The trend of moralizing work presents a paradox for contemporary workers. Employees equate their failures to live up to “good employee” ideals (e.g., always available, highly motivated, passionate) with moral failings. Yet, consistently meeting these ideals is unattainable for most employees. This manuscript introduces and develops the phenomenon of microconfessions—informal, low-magnitude confessions—as an overlooked tactic that employees use to alleviate the ongoing moral dilemma of falling short on moralized work ideals. Integrating self-disclosure and work moralization scholarship with insights from fields that have explicitly studied confession, I build a theory of employee microconfessions. I suggest that microconfessions provide the sharer with a sense of relief and a restored sense of morality, which in turn, have downstream consequences. I also pinpoint guilt—an emotion particularly relevant to the moralization of work—as key to activating and strengthening the effects of microconfessions. Finally, I illuminate how the information shared and the setting in which it is shared jointly influence the effects that I outline. My work establishes microconfessions as a unique form of workplace self-disclosure and pivots existing theories to consider functions of disclosure historically overlooked in organizational scholarship. It also contributes new understanding to how employees may experience and offset the moralization of work as well as when it is most advantageous for them to do so.</content>

    <title>Delegation and Chief Financial Officer Retention: Evidence from Chief Accounting Officers on the Executive Team</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, chief financial officer (CFO) responsibilities and resignations have increased. Given these trends, we examine whether delegating accounting is associated with CFO retention. We develop a methodology to identify voluntary CFO departures using the firm’s public messaging around the CFO’s exit. Our results suggest that CFOs are less likely to voluntarily depart when accounting is delegated. Further, we find evidence that the negative association between delegating accounting and voluntary CFO departures is stronger when accounting demands are higher. Moreover, we find evidence that delegating accounting increases the CFO’s human capital. When CFOs do leave, they are more likely to become a chief executive officer and less likely to make a lateral move to another CFO position. Taken together, this study finds evidence consistent with the delegation of accounting increasing CFO retention and human capital.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: The authors appreciate research funding support from Coggin College of Business, University of North Florida and Tippie College of Business, University of Iowa.

    <title>The Role of Success and Failure in Fluid Teams: Evidence from the Motion Picture Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many business settings involve fluid teams, where team members come together to work on a project, after which the team is disbanded. It is well-known that coordination can be challenging and affect the performance outcomes of fluid teams. The literature has studied how several facets of experience can facilitate learning and improve outcomes for fluid teams. However, the role of experience with success and failure and its effect on improving outcomes for fluid teams has remained unexplored. In this study, we use data from the motion picture industry to examine how the experience with success and failure resident within key members of a movie production team affects profitability. Our analysis of the data for 2,091 movies released in the United States between 1999 and 2018 reveals that a movie’s profitability depends on the production team’s history with success and failure. Additionally, we find that teams with a history of success result in movies with higher profits, whereas teams with a history of failure result in movies with lower profits. We also find that increased relative dispersion in the team’s experience does not affect the movie’s profitability. Further analysis of the composition of movie teams indicates that financial performance can be significantly impacted when movie teams are predominantly composed of members with a history of success or failure. We contribute by illustrating a new measure of team experience relevant for fluid teams and by providing insights on how to compose teams based on members’ experience with success and failure.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03756 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify latent demands in index option markets using a sign-restricted vector autoregression (VAR) and highlight the bias from treating (equilibrium) net demand as exogenous. Market-maker and end-user demand curves are far from infinitely elastic as assumed by some models, but elasticities exceed existing estimates for equities. Characterizing demand curves provides insights into the structure of index option markets. Deteriorating market conditions are associated with right shifts of the latent demand curves. The at-the-money (ATM) (out-of-the-money (OTM)) markets for calls and puts are mainly driven by end-user (market-maker) demand, and end-user (market-maker) ATM (OTM) call option demand predicts S&amp;P500 returns.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04263 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Endorsement Rate in Influencer Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Influencer marketing has emerged as a prevalent marketing strategy for firms seeking to engage target customers, with significant research identifying various criteria for influencer selection. However, the role of endorsement rate—the proportion of an influencer’s brand-sponsored posts relative to their total social media posts—remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how influencers’ endorsement rates affect the effectiveness of their subsequent sponsored posts. Using a multimethod approach, including two field studies and two controlled experiments across diverse platform contexts (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Douyin), the findings reveal a consistent U-shaped relationship between endorsement rate and consumer engagement with sponsored posts. This pattern arises from the interplay of two countervailing forces: a higher endorsement rate enhances the influencer’s perceived brand recognition, yet it simultaneously raises audience suspicion of manipulative intent. Notably, organic product mentions and consistent brand endorsements can attenuate the impact of endorsement rates on consumer engagement. Beyond advancing research in influencer marketing and brand endorsements, these findings offer marketers a valuable framework for evaluating influencers and making more informed selections.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands use factory tours, visitor centers, and other behind-the-scenes encounters to share their histories and operations. These backstory performances are fragile events that must balance revealing and concealing. This article definesbrand backstoriesas selectively disclosive narratives offering a curated set of brand content, and conceptualizes brand backstory performances as spatially embedded enactments that invite consumers into a staged version of what feels like a backstage. Drawing on dramaturgical theory, we examine how brands negotiate the tension between showcasing transparency and retaining control during backstory performances. A multimethod investigation centered on four primary backstory sites identifies three interdependent dimensions of the backstory performance (staging performance elements, orchestrating the characters, and tailoring the script) that together modulate consumers’ experience of transparency. Backstory experiences must be skillfully delivered, stimulating, and safe to optimize perceived transparency. This research reframes brand transparency from a property that brands possess to a narrative experience they perform. It shows how contemporary brand storytelling depends on carefully curated and staged encounters that are calibrated to the optimal dosage of revelation to make insider status feel real without surrendering control.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conventional wisdom holds that lowering a home country's interest rate relative to another's will depreciate the domestic currency. We document that, at business‐cycle frequencies, U.S. forward guidance monetary policy easings had the opposite effect during the Great Recession. We attribute this effect to calendar‐based forward guidance that signaled economic weakness, resulting in a “flight‐to‐safety” effect and lower expected U.S. inflation. We also document cross‐currency heterogeneity: a surprise U.S. rate cut induced a larger appreciation of the dollar against currencies that typically depreciate more when the world economy is contracting. We build a model that can reconcile these findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of asset revaluation in the monetary transmission mechanism. We build an analytical heterogeneous‐agents model with two main ingredients: (i) rare disasters and (ii) heterogeneous beliefs. The model captures time‐varying risk premia and precautionary savings in a setting that nests the textbook New Keynesian model. The model generates large movements in asset prices after a monetary shock but these movements can be neutral on real variables. Real effects depend on the redistribution among agents with heterogeneous precautionary motives. In quantitative analysis, we find that this channel can account for a large fraction of the transmission to aggregate consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that a U‐shaped monetary rate path increases banking crisis risk, via credit and asset price cycles, analyzing 17 countries over 150 years. Rate hikes (raw or instrumented) increase crisis risk, but only if preceded by prolonged cuts. These patterns are unique to banking crises, unlike noncrisis recessions. Regarding the mechanism, prolonged cuts raise the likelihood of large credit and asset price booms, consistent with higher credit supply and risk‐taking. Subsequent hikes strongly reduce credit and asset prices, and increase banks' realized credit risk, rather than interest rate risk. We find consistent results in administrative loan‐level data for Spain.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Password Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Password sharing is widespread across subscription-based industries, such as streaming services like Netflix. Although sharing reduces out-of-pocket costs for users, it also creates sharing-related burdens, such as privacy concerns and coordination hassles. We develop a game-theoretic model in which a firm serves two consumer segments—password sharers and nonsharers—to analyze how password sharing affects firm performance and consumer outcomes. Our results show that sharing enables groups of users to “self-bundle” by aggregating their valuations and subscribing through a single shared account. It also creates implicit price discrimination; sharers self-select between sharing and subscribing individually under a uniform price. These mechanisms can increase a firm’s revenue when sharing costs are low. In addition, password sharing reshapes the disparity between sharers and nonsharers. When nonsharers have sufficiently higher willingness to pay, the firm is even more likely to benefit from sharing. However, password sharing poses policy concerns. We find that it reduces social welfare and consumer surplus across a broad range of conditions—especially when sharing costs are moderate. Moreover, the firm’s profit-maximizing strategy, particularly when it chooses to accommodate sharing, often conflicts with what is best for consumers or society. These insights highlight the need for firms to carefully evaluate sharing policies and in some cases, for regulators to intervene to protect consumer welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on crowdfunding has largely focused on fundraising success, overlooking post-success outcomes. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, we hypothesize that user entrepreneurs show higher intrinsic but lower extrinsic motivation than non-users, with intrinsic motivation boosting delivery performance and extrinsic motivation hindering it. Using a mixed-method approach—an exploratory qualitative study and an analysis of 322 crowdfunded ventures—we find that user entrepreneurs deliver rewards more timely than non-user entrepreneurs, and that intrinsic motivation significantly mediates this relationship, while extrinsic motivation’s mediating role is insignificant. We contribute to the user entrepreneurship and crowdfunding literatures by highlighting drivers of post-campaign success.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs use strategic framing to gain support for their novel ventures, products, and services. A key challenge entrepreneurs face is that audiences often contest frames that introduce novel ideas, especially when these ideas disrupt audiences' mental and business models. Such contestation can hinder novel ideas from being accepted, a risk that is amplified when entrepreneurs face contestation from multiple audiences. We lack understanding, however, of how contestation from multiple audiences shapes the strategic framing of novel ideas. We study this question at Tony's Chocolonely, a social enterprise that faced such contestation when introducing “slave‐free” chocolate. By showing how the social enterprise reacted to contestation from multiple audiences in different ways, we uncover novel mechanisms of frame change and stability.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs use strategic framing to gain support for their novel ideas, products, and services. In so doing, they must navigate resistance from different audiences, especially when entrepreneurs introduce novel ideas that disrupt the status quo. Audience resistance can hinder novel ideas from gaining momentum. We do not know, however, how entrepreneurs can navigate resistance from multiple audiences. Our study examines how Tony's Chocolonely, a social enterprise fighting child labor in the chocolate industry, navigated resistance against its “slave‐free” chocolate from diverse audiences. Our study reveals novel insights into how audience resistance shapes entrepreneurs' strategic framing of novel ideas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fraud indicators within the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a major COVID relief program, are highly geographically concentrated. ZIP codes and counties with high rates of suspicious PPP loans are strongly social connected, with evidence that fraud spreads spatially over time through social networks. Individuals in suspicious social media groups have higher rates of PPP fraud, and socially connected ZIP codes frequently use the same specific FinTech lenders, consistent with social networks influencing detailed loan decisions. Our findings suggest that more proactive data analysis is needed for fraud prevention, detection, and prosecution to prevent the social spread of fraudulent schemes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stream SGD: Fast Learning and Valid Inference from Dependent DataMany online optimization problems in operations research rely on data generated by Markovian systems whose dynamics depend on the decision parameters, creating both statistical dependence and biased gradient information. This paper, “Convergence and Inference of Stream Stochastic Gradient Descent, with Applications to Queueing Systems and Inventory Control,” develops a unified theory for stream stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a sample-efficient method that uses just one observation per iteration. Using Poisson-equation techniques, the authors quantify and control gradient bias and dependence, proving an optimal [Formula: see text] convergence rate and a state-of-the-art O(log T) regret bound. Beyond optimization performance, the paper introduces an online inference framework for uncertainty quantification and establishes a functional central limit theorem that underpins valid asymptotic inference. A new Wasserstein-type divergence yields verifiable conditions via coupling arguments tailored to operations research models. Applications to queueing and inventory problems demonstrate how the theory translates into practical, scalable algorithms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While prior studies typically treat firm reputation as a stable, intangible resource reflecting cumulative competence, we extend a socio‐constructionist perspective by shifting the focus toreputation instability– erratic fluctuations in a firm’s reputation over time relative to its industry peers. We argue that reputation instability functions as a distinct and often overlooked market signal by introducing ambiguities that influence investor valuation of a firm in a stock market context. Crucially, the impact of reputation instability is further shaped by contextual cues that anchor investor expectations. A firm’scurrent reputationandindustry dynamismcondition how instability may be regarded, either as a warning sign or a potential indication of improvement. Using panel data across four major US industry groups over 21 years, we find evidence consistent with our theoretical framework and identify critical boundary conditions under which reputation instability is penalized or rewarded by the market. By reframing reputation as a dynamic and unstable construct, our study advances theory on reputation signals, offering novel insights into how reputational temporal dynamics – not just established levels – shape firms’ market outcomes.</content>

    <title>Trapped in the MNE matrix: liminal identity at the local–corporate–global nexus</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers’ identities in large matrixed MNE structures are complex and pliable. While research has examined the identities of individual actors located in headquarters (HQ) or local subsidiaries, the unique identity challenges faced by those operating outside these conventional units are less predictable. Our study explores how managers experience and manage a ‘liminal identity’—feeling ‘betwixt and between’ multiple identity positions. Focusing on US MNEs in the life sciences sector, we interviewed managers who assumed global responsibilities from corporate HQ while remaining situated in their local (Irish) subsidiary. We find that operating between corporate HQ, a global network, and the local subsidiary forged a liminal identity. Straddling this local–corporate–global nexus was a profoundly ambiguous, precarious, and destabilizing experience. Yet, individuals also sought to leverage their liminal identity by adopting multiple identities, depending on the audience. This involved ‘switching’ between renouncing a local identity, assimilating a corporate identity and co-constructing a global identity. However, this produced an intense identity struggle, eroding a clear sense of self and belonging. Our study cautions firms to be attentive when supporting managers in these ‘in-between’ spaces to avoid the trap of ‘identity limbo’, where individuals risk becoming disconnected and isolated.</content>

    <title>From decision patience to process patience: A decision–process integration of the choice to wait and the experience of waiting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer impatience has long been examined through the lens of intertemporal choice, where patience is inferred from decisions to accept delayed rewards. Yet, this conceptualization captures only thechoiceto wait, not theexperienceof waiting. Sweeny's Process Model of Patience (PMP) shifts the focus from temporal preferences to temporal affect, defining impatience as a negatively valenced emotional response to objectionable delays and patience as the active regulation of this emotion. In this commentary, I bridge these two traditions by mapping the psychological drivers of intertemporal choice—affective urges, cognitive representations, construal, subjective time perception, and future‐self connectedness—onto the mechanisms that shape waiting experiences. This decision–process integration of impatience reveals where the two perspectives converge, where they diverge, and why these distinctions matter for understanding consumer behavior. I propose several testable predictions illustrating how choice patience and process patience dissociate, how motivations and mental representations shift across the decision–waiting timeline, and how environmental cues can reduce uncertainty at choice yet heighten impatience during the wait. Together, these insights suggest a more complete temporal model of impatience—one that begins before the decision is made and continues throughout the delay that follows.</content>

    <title>Overcoming barriers? The mixed results of social innovation accelerator programs for women entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship accelerators are increasingly promoted as structural interventions to close gender gaps, yet studies have not established a differential impact of participation for women. This prior evidence—drawn from high‐tech, male‐dominated settings—may overlook how outcomes differ in more feminized domains such as social innovation. Using unique multi‐level data from 1417 ventures applying to 33 accelerators, we examine whether average effects conceal variation across institutional environments and program designs. We find that in more gender‐egalitarian countries, women‐led ventures performed better than peers after participating, especially in programs aiming to support women. In less egalitarian environments, however, participation offered negative or no such advantages even in gender supportive programs. These results suggest that well‐intended interventions to advance women entrepreneurs are context‐dependent and may sometimes reinforce the very disparities they intended to diminish.Managerial SummarySocial innovation accelerators are often championed as a way to help women entrepreneurs thrive. But our analysis of 1417 ventures applying to 33 programs shows that results vary—and context matters. In more egalitarian countries, participation is associated with improved performance for women‐led ventures, especially when programs are explicitly designed to support them. Surprisingly, the pattern flips in less egalitarian environments: women founders who join even women‐focused programs often see no performance gains—or even declines—relative to peers. These findings suggest that well‐intentioned support can backfire if it doesn't fit the local institutional environment. For program designers and leaders, this is a call to move beyond one‐size‐fits‐all approaches and carefully align equity goals with the realities of the ecosystems they operate in.</content>

    <title>Ecosystem conditions and the efficacy of entrepreneurial support organizations: Moderating effects on venture entry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a panel of 2688 city‐year observations of German fintech ventures and entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), we examine how ESO presence relates to venture entry. We argue and demonstrate that this relationship is contingent on local founding conditions. We find that ESO presence is most strongly associated with entry in thin ecosystems, while this association weakens in more active and developed contexts. Patterns in entries of non‐supported versus ESO‐supported ventures, along with differences across ESO types, support our argument that primarily ecosystem‐level bridging mechanisms, such as legitimacy diffusion, knowledge spillovers, and access to relational networks, are sensitive to local conditions, whereas direct support provided by ESOs to program participants is not context‐dependent.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs, entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), and ecosystem builders benefit from understanding the broader economic and entrepreneurial context. In well‐developed ecosystems, informal networks can provide access to knowledge, collaboration opportunities, and legitimacy signals, reducing the marginal contribution of additional ESO presence in the ecosystem. In less‐developed ecosystems, ESOs can support venture formation by bridging entrepreneurs to networks, partners, and markets, and by mitigating resource scarcity and the challenges of newness. Structured programs, targeted mentorship, and guidance can support venture entry across the ecosystem, complementing existing informal networks and addressing gaps where they exist. Our findings suggest that the role and potential impact of ESOs vary with local founding conditions, emphasizing the importance of aligning support mechanisms with ecosystem maturity and structural characteristics.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint or Independent? Sourcing and Inspection Decisions in Emerging Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the presence of supplier quality risk, offering suppliers a higher procurement price or increasing inspection effort are two approaches to motivate a supplier to invest in higher quality. In this paper, we consider three sourcing and inspection strategies for a brand with two branch shops facing supplier quality risk: joint, mixed, and independent strategies. Under the joint strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a uniform procurement price and inspects for both shops in a centralized way (joint sourcing and joint inspection). Under the mixed strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a procurement price and then each shop decides its own inspection probability (joint sourcing and independent inspection). Under the independent strategy, each shop decides its own procurement price and inspection probability (independent sourcing and independent inspection).We find that among the three strategies, the joint strategy mostly relies on the inspection tool to motivate supplier’s high-quality effort, and the mixed strategy mainly utilizes the procurement price tool by offering the highest price for supplier’s high quality.We further find that, no matter the brand is purely profit driven or cares about the quantity of low-quality products sold to the market, the mixed strategy is always preferred to independent strategy. The preference between mixed and joint strategies is jointly determined by the fixed cost incurred in joint sourcing and inspection accuracy. For intermediate fixed cost, if the inspection accuracy is sufficiently high, the mixed strategy is preferred to joint strategy; otherwise, the joint strategy is preferred to the mixed strategy. Interestingly, when a brand becomes more socially responsible (i.e., it cares more about the quantity of lowquality products sold to the market), it may switch from a reliable supplier to a risky supplier, leading to more low-quality products sold to the market. This is because with a greater level of social responsibility, the brand’s higher inspection efforts become more credible, which motivates the risky supplier’s higher quality effort.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain technology holds promise for improving access to financing within supply chains, especially for small and under-financed suppliers. Yet, the specific ways in which blockchain technology mitigates financing frictions and the features that contribute to successful platform implementations remain unclear. Following a theory elaboration approach, we close that gap by studying which financing frictions the BCF solutions aim to address, which blockchain features they use, and the association between the frictions and features. In our analysis, we examine 312 documents with unstructured text describing 11 BCF solutions, both successful and failed. Using AI-based large language models, we identify patterns connecting seven types of financing frictions and three key blockchain features. We find that the transactional friction is the most prominent, despite receiving limited attention in the academic literature, while bankruptcy costs and taxes—frictions that are commonly discussed in the literature—are rarely associated with blockchain features in our sample. Among blockchain features, tokenization is used sparingly; and, unlike other features, it appears in successful BCF solutions only. Moreover, connections between frictions and features are not random: while transactional and hidden actions frictions are linked to all three blockchain features, other frictions are typically associated with only one. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which blockchain adds value in supply chain finance, suggesting that aligning blockchain features with specific frictions may enhance the chances of success. We also demonstrate a method for using AI to evaluate large amounts of unstructured data in operations management research.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Risk Aversion in a Data-Driven Multi-Period Inventory Control Problem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study multi-period risk-averse inventory control in a data-driven setting. In this problem, a risk-averse retailer makes periodic decisions on inventory levels based only on historical demand observations without full knowledge of the demand distribution. We adopt the popular nested formulation for risk-averse programs to formulate this multi-period problem and its data-driven counterpart under a coherent risk measure. Our objective is to study the sample complexity bound such that with high probability, the data-driven policy is near-optimal, i.e., the relative error of risk under the data-driven policy compared with the optimal risk is arbitrarily small. Analysis of this problem is inherently challenging, because the multi-period nature requires solving the risk-averse program and its data-driven version recursively backward in time, while the (empirical) risk-to-go functions in this process do not have closed-form derivatives for most risk measures, which renders existing first-order methods for the risk-neutral newsvendor model invalid. In this study, we develop a zeroth-order framework to establish the complexity bound on sample sizes to guarantee nearoptimality of the data-driven policy with given accuracy levels. Instead of using first-order derivative information on the risk-to-go function, our analysis directly examines the class of functions that underpins each cumulative risk function and derives maximum inequalities for this functional class by computing the covering numbers. Finite-sample complexity bounds are then used to establish asymptotic properties of the estimated risk, including consistency and convergence rate. Computationally, the time complexity for solving the data-driven policy, which is essentially an empirical dynamic programming (EDP) estimator of the optimal policy, increases exponentially in the length of the planning horizon. To speed up computation, we propose an approximation scheme that recursively approximates the empirical cumulative risk function with a convex piecewise linear function and then minimize it to obtain a modified data-driven inventory policy. We show that with proper control for approximation error, the modified data-driven policy is also near-optimal, and it has the same order of sample complexity bound as that for the original EDP policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of content-creation technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has reshaped the way people produce and consume content. These technologies democratize content creation, enabling inexperienced individuals to generate content that rivals the quality produced by professionals. This paper adopts a game-theoretic model to study how the democratization of content creation affects welfare. While the content-democratization technology can assist low-quality creators in improving their content quality, it can precipitate a flood of such content in the market and crowd out high-quality content production, leading to welfare losses. An incremental technology development with low reduction in quality gap can hurt individual consumers and all creators, leading to a lose-lose market outcome. In contrast, a drastic one with high reduction in quality gap benefits individual consumers and all creators, leading to a win-win outcome. Furthermore, when platforms can more effectively screen content and promote high-quality content, welfare rises but the technology is more likely to reduce welfare. The findings help explain the distinct impacts of content democratization in different industries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should firms best communicate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts? Across seven preregistered studies (two large field studies and five online lab experiments), we find that making a series of periodic contributions, e.g., donating $20,000 per month for 12 months, rather than donating an equivalent aggregate amount, e.g., donating $240,000 in a year, improves outcomes for donor companies such as reputation, customer engagement, and purchase likelihood. The benefits of periodic donations arise primarily due to heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation, which affects outcomes in two ways. Via one process pathway, the consistency of periodic donations increases judgments that the donor gave due to authentic prosocial motives, which then increases favorable donor evaluations. Via a second process pathway, heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation also increase the perceived impact of the donation, further boosting favorable donor evaluations. Additional studies demonstrate when and why periodic donations may benefit, or in some cases even harm, evaluations of the donor. Taken together, this research highlights consumers’ sensitivity to cues of consistency, and the importance of perceived authentic prosocial motivation, when consumers grant charitable credit in CSR.</content>

    <title>Whom Should Entrepreneurs Approach? The Effect of Contact Status on Referring New Ventures for Acquisition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior entrepreneurial network literature has primarily examined how entrepreneurs’ networking efforts facilitate interorganizational exchanges, while giving little attention to the agency of their contacts. In this study, we investigate how contacts’ intra‐organizational status shapes their actions of referring entrepreneurs to their organizations for acquisition. Drawing on middle‐status conformity theory and interviews, we argue that, compared to high‐ or low‐status actors, middle‐status actors are more concerned about status loss and face a higher likelihood of such loss; therefore, they have a lower tendency to connect entrepreneurs with their organizations, resulting in a U‐shaped effect of contact status on referring actions including quantity, quality, and efficiency. Furthermore, this U‐shaped effect is moderated by organizational ownership and norms. The results based on 12,103 venture‐acquirer dyads support most of our hypotheses. Our study contributes to the entrepreneurial network literature by identifying the agency of contacts and their specific referring actions. It also adds to the network agency literature by highlighting the organizational context in which the contacts are situated as a critical enabler or inhibitor of such agency. In addition, it enriches the mergers and acquisitions literature by revealing the roles of actors at various organizational levels in facilitating corporate engagement with new ventures.</content>

    <title>Structural Choices at Alliance Formation: Accounting for Partner Asymmetry in Industry Distance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Parties in an alliance aim to capture both common and private benefits. As they transfer and jointly create knowledge to generate common gains, differences in private benefits can arise due to asymmetric knowledge spillovers. Our model of alliance structural choices incorporates the alliance itself—the channel through which partner knowledge flows—to reflect the fact that partners and the alliance may operate in different industry contexts. We propose that partners select structural governance mechanisms (equity governance and alliance scope) to enable valuable knowledge flows while protecting themselves from unwanted spillovers. Analyzing a large sample of U.S. alliances from 1985 to 2024, we find that asymmetric distance predicts these governance choices and that it is linked to the simultaneous use of multiple structural safeguards, including equity governance and a narrow alliance scope.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media have fundamentally reshaped how organizations and audiences interact, challenging theoretical assumptions in the management literature. With this integrative literature review, we take stock of a fragmented body of research, based on an analysis of 647 articles across 9 disciplines. Our synthesis identifies three dominant perspectives: an organization-centric perspective that views social media as tools for strategic action; an audience-centric perspective that emphasizes audience empowerment and contestation; and a platform-centric perspective that highlights how platform features and algorithms condition organizational outcomes and audience interactions. Building on these perspectives, we develop an integrative framework of organizational enablement, audience empowerment, and platform mediation that captures how social media extend and redirect established theories. We distill five major research areas—identity and community, social evaluations, corporate social responsibility, false narratives, and organizational outcome drivers—that capture the core themes of management scholarship to date. Our analysis shows how social media distinctiveness—heightened emotionality, many-to-many diffusion, and expanded actor visibility—has generated theoretical extensions while leaving key debates unresolved. We argue that management research must better integrate across perspectives, expand attention to platform mediation, and incorporate insights from related fields. We conclude with a bold future research agenda for researchers who aim to advance theorizing on organization audience relationships in a complex media ecosystem.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Regulation with Firm Linkages: Evidence from Texas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the efficiency of dynamic linked environmental regulation. Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical mechanisms that underpin the benefit—a “firm-wide moral hazard mechanism” and a “correlated targeting mechanism”—and find that a large share of the value of linked regulation is due to the former.</content>

    <title>Education and the Margins of Cyclical Adjustment in the Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Allocative wages—the labor costs considered when deciding to form or dissolve a long-term employment relationship—are more sensitive to cyclical conditions for more educated workers. Specifically, college-educated workers’ allocative wages are highly pro-cyclical, while high school dropouts’ wages exhibit only moderate cyclicality. Further, as education increases, an increasing share of the sensitivity of allocative wages is driven by the persistent scarring effects of the cyclical position at the time of hiring on the wages associated with higher levels of tenure, amounting to more than a third of the overall sensitivity for the college educated. The greater job stability of the more educated—and therefore the exposure to scarring—contributes to these differences. In addition, more significant scarring at each horizon of tenure amplifies the effect. In service of documenting these facts, I develop new methods for inferring the sensitivity of labor costs to shocks when agents are forward-looking and wages may be intertemporally smoothed.</content>

    <title>Automation and Rent Dissipation: Implications for Wages, Inequality, and Productivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of automation in a task-based economy in which some jobs pay workers rents—wages above their outside option. We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents, amplifying wage losses, and reducing within-group wage dispersion in exposed groups. This form of rent dissipation is inefficient and offsets the productivity gains from automation. Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total. Our estimates imply that inefficient rent dissipation has offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation over this period.</content>

    <title>A Theory of How Workers Keep up with Inflation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model that integrates modern theories of labor market flows with nominal wage rigidities to study the consequences of inflation on the labor market. Nominal wage stickiness incentivizes workers to engage in job-to-job transitions after an unexpected increase in the price level. Such dynamics lead to a rise in aggregate vacancies associating a seemingly tight labor market with lower real wages—two facts observed during the recent inflation period. The calibrated model jointly matches aggregate and cross-sectional trends in worker flows and wages during the 2021-2024 period. Using historical data, we show that prior periods of high inflation were also associated with increasing vacancies and upward shifts in the Beveridge curve. Our results suggest that policymakers and academics should be cautious about viewing the rise in the vacancy-to-unemployment rate as a sign of a tight labor market during inflationary periods without holistically looking at other labor market indicators.</content>

    <title>Trajectory Normalizing Work in Unstable Production Environments: When Adapting Production Means Appearing Authentic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations emphasize specific production practices to deal with authenticity pressures, but the practices that signal authenticity to audiences must be continually adapted when production environments are unstable. Changes in the environment can make production practices suddenly infeasible, compelling organizations to perform in different ways the highly visible practices that audiences have come to associate with authenticity. However, authenticity research tends to take the continuity of production practices for granted, focusing on whether certain practices are made visible or not, and leaving unexamined how practices are made legible as they are adapted. Drawing on 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a renowned winery (Cal-Cru), I identify a novel form of authenticity work—trajectory normalizing work—that Cal-Cru’s production team performed internally, out of view from external audiences, to guide production changes. Specifically, the team created contrast cues to inform their actions. They avoided changes that would noticeably alter parts of production visible to audiences, or that clashed with their own understanding of authenticity. Doing so created a reassuring sense among the team that they were departing from audience expectations to sustain, not compromise, the practices that conveyed authenticity. My study highlights the backstage tensions constructing authenticity in unstable production environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies price and liquidity dynamics in the presence of costly short-selling when uninformed traders have limited willingness-to-pay to trade securities. In this setting, unraveling and Bayesian social learning interact to produce a novel mechanism, dynamic unraveling: Unraveling that generates signals that lead to future unraveling. Applying the theory, I show how dynamic unraveling explains low-volume crashes: falls in the prices of securities on low or declining trading volume. In this context, short-selling restrictions can make low-volume crashes more likely by intensifying dynamic unraveling, but liquidity injections have the opposite effect.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02412 .</content>

    <title>Earnings Conference Calls and the SEC Comment Letter Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews firms’ financial reports and issues comment letters to ensure compliance with applicable disclosure and accounting requirements. We explore the nature, determinants, and consequences of SEC comment letters that refer to information disclosed in voluntary earnings conference calls. Using hand-collected data, we document that the SEC primarily references these voluntary disclosures to illustrate insufficiencies and, less commonly, inconsistencies in mandatory filings across a wide range of topics. These letters are more likely to be issued when filing reviews are more complex, SEC staff are less resource constrained, and for firms with more institutional investors and analysts. Conference call–related comments tend to occur during higher-quality review processes and require greater remediation costs than other comments. The SEC’s use of call disclosures also leads to more pronounced changes in firms’ subsequent mandatory filings, particularly when the firm indicates agreement with SEC comments. However, we observe a mixed effect on the overall information environment, consistent with possible unintended consequences for the quality of firms’ voluntary disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02065 .</content>

    <title>Leadership and the Virtue of Humanity: Conceptual Clarity, Systematic Review, and Future Research Agenda</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humanity – the virtue enabling meaningful human connection – is vital to the leadership we need to survive ourpolycrisiscontext. As a prerequisite to sustainable human community, the virtue of humanity is considered universal. It has been claimed as a ‘higher‐order virtue’, comprised of and enacted by – but irreducible to – a suite of ‘lower‐order virtues’ such as compassion and kindness. This claim is evident in widely‐adopted virtues catalogues, but we lack consensus on how humanity is defined, and which attributes qualify as its virtuous dimensions. To address this, we develop a robust definition of humanity and apply criteria distilled from virtue ethics to theorize the lower‐order virtues that comprise its virtuous dimensions. We thus determine the virtuous dimensions of humanity include empathy, compassion, forgiveness, love, kindness, and generosity. Our processual model illustrates how, when expressed by leaders and followers, these virtuous dimensions represent the fullest expression of the higher‐order virtue of humanity and sustain human community. Our systematic review details what is known empirically about each virtuous dimension of humanity in relation to leadership. Drawing on this, we propose a research agenda to advance understanding of how the virtue of humanity might enable the leadership needed today and into the future.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations today operate in a new information environment, where changing technologies have enabled fundamentally different forms and pathways of information creation and dissemination while also generating unintended consequences – chief among them increased polarization. In combination, the new information environment and polarization have profoundly altered the social processes underpinning social evaluations. To animate social evaluations research on these issues, we consider how information environment shifts and increased polarization affect the value and durability of five social evaluation types – legitimacy, reputation, status, celebrity/infamy, and stigma/esteem. We highlight the implications for both theorizing about and empirically studying social evaluations in an ever more polarized world.</content>

    <title>“I Hold On”: How Country Music Songwriters Cope With the Precarity of Craft Work</title>
    <updated>2026-02-06T14:19:54+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We find that the key to coping with precarity lies in achieving supportive patterns of social embeddedness by investing in primary craft skills, advancing higher-order vocational skills, and navigating the core-periphery structure of the creative craft production system. As apprentice songwriters practice their craft and learn how to organize their songwriting routines, they become increasingly vested in the system. Once they become master songwriters, they broaden their networks by liaising more with other industry stakeholders and engage with the system more reflexively to ensure their continued relevance. Peripheral workers engage in allyship and develop ties with workers positioned at the system’s core. We incorporate these social strategies in a grounded theoretical model capturing how songwriters cope with precarity. We conjecture that elements of the model generalize theoretically towards other corporatized creative craft production systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job positions and appointing females to managerial positions. However, the founder's HR education mitigates these negative effects on both female hiring and managerial appointments, while the founder's HR experience only mitigates the negative effects on female hiring decisions. We also tease out the invoked mechanisms, conduct post hoc tests, and run an extensive number of robustness tests.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the efficiency of self-enforced relational agreements, a common solution to contracting frictions, when sellers have market power and contracts cannot be externally enforced. To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers——that is, same-day facilities——we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency. (JEL D82, D91, G51, I11, I18, L84)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess whether men and women are treated differently when presenting their economics research. We collected data across thousands of seminars, job market talks, and conference presentations, leveraging human judgment and audio-processing algorithms to measure the number, tone, and type of interruptions. Within a seminar series, women are interrupted more than men. This holds when controlling for characteristics of the presenter, paper, and audience. Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect. (JEL A11, C45, J16, J44)</content>

We revalue New York City office buildings, taking into account both the cash flow and discount rate implications of these shocks, and find a 46 percent decline in long-run value. For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction. Higher-quality buildings were buffered against these trends due to a flight to quality, while lower-quality offices are at risk of becoming a stranded asset. These valuation changes have repercussions for financial stability and local public finances. (JEL E31, E32, G12, J22, M51, R33)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that subjective assessments of employee “potential” contribute to gender gaps in promotion and pay. Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women’s lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping. (JEL J16, J31, J71, L81, M12, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of intensifying competition for contracts in the context of US Defense procurement. Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level. (JEL D12, D31, E12, E21, E32, E52, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the effects of improving public transit infrastructure on city structure and welfare. It develops a quantitative urban model with multiple worker groups and transit modes, and derives a special case yielding sufficient statistics for aggregate welfare in a broad class of models. The paper estimates reduced-form elasticities to implement the approach using data spanning construction of the world’s largest Bus Rapid Transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains. Accounting for reallocation and general equilibrium effects, distributional impacts are modest. (JEL H76, L92, L98, O18, R42, R53)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly. (JEL F13, F14, G21, L22, L61, L62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reference-dependent preferences can explain several puzzling observations about organizational change. We introduce a dynamic model in which a firm bargains with loss-averse workers about organizational change and wages. We show that change is often stagnant or slow for many periods, followed by a sudden boost in productivity triggered by a crisis. In a crisis, workers concede to organizational change but resist nominal wage reductions. In addition, the model explains why different firms in the same industry often have significant productivity differences. Finally, the model demonstrates the importance of expectations management even if all parties have rational expectations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide quasi-experimental evidence of how an innovative market-based solution using remote-sensing technology can mitigate drought-induced conflict. Droughts are a major driver of conflict in Africa, particularly between transhumant pastoralists and sedentary farmers. Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) piloted in Kenya provides automated, preemptive payouts to pastoralists affected by droughts. Combining variation in rainfall and the staggered rollout of IBLI in Kenya over the 2000-2020 period, we find that IBLI strongly reduces drought-induced conflict. Key mechanisms include a reduction in herd sizes, as well as income smoothing and asset-price stabilization, contributing to an overall reduced migratory pressure for pastoralists. Our study suggests that market-based solutions are a scalable, cost-effective pathway to mitigate conflict, complementing political solutions such as power-sharing agreements and institutional reforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and this results in a higher industry profit but lower consumer surplus. Compared with their absence, loyalty programs decrease both industry profit and consumer welfare, leading to a lose–lose outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that, when the firms are heterogeneous in terms of their network sizes, those with larger networks tend to offer lower rewards yet achieve greater consumer loyalty in contrast to the firms with smaller networks, which compensate with higher rewards.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: T.T.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research reports and earnings conference calls. They also display distinct cognitive and linguistic patterns when discussing E&amp;S issues. Furthermore, female analysts are more likely to issue lower stock recommendations and target prices (lower stock recommendations) following negative E&amp;S discussions in their reports (E&amp;S incidents) than male analysts. Finally, investors respond more strongly to female analysts’ negative tones when discussing E&amp;S issues. Overall, our findings suggest that gender diversity among analysts plays a significant role in shaping corporate E&amp;S practices and provide new insights into the origins of gender differences in skills within the equity analyst profession.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: We acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2022-0285] and the Sauder Exploratory Research Grants Program.

    <title>Managerial actions using historical values for tackling hyper‐competitive environments: The case of Toyota</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides a causal explanation concerning how managerial actions using historical values contribute to dynamic capabilities, or sustaining competitive advantage in changing environments. Based on historical methods that consist mainly of hermeneutics, contextualization, and source criticism, it analyzes sources and data on how Toyota strategically responded to the competitive dynamics of the automotive industry centered around modularization. This resulted in the identification of three types of managerial action using historical values—filtering,integrating, andmodifying—which have a rhetorical influence on the processes of strategic diagnosis, choice, and action respectively in ways that strengthen the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. This enables the firm to adapt to hyper‐competitive environments while maintaining the idiosyncrasies of its core capabilities.Managerial SummaryToyota has sustained its competitive advantage for decades by consistently relying on its core capabilities, especially the Toyota Production System and its longstanding supplier relations. How has Toyota been able to do so while facing rapidly changing environments? This paper seeks to explore this question by comparing Toyota's and Nissan's strategies in response to modularization in the automotive industry in the 1990s and 2000s. It uncovers how a firm's managers can utilize historical values in ways that influence the processes of strategy formation and implementation. This allows the firm to incorporate key elements of new strategies that its rivals introduce in the marketplace alongside the firm's strategies based on its core capabilities, thereby adapting to hyper‐competitive environments while sustaining its idiosyncrasies and competitive advantage.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multiproduct Dynamic Pricing with Popularity Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Popularity bias, reflects the positive impact of popularity information on consumer choices. There are two common display formats for popularity information on online retail platforms: the total-based cumulative sales format, where the total sales of a product are displayed since its launch, and the period-based cumulative sales format, where only sales within a specific recent period are shown. Both types of popularity information are continuously updated. This paper focuses on the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem with popularity bias. We employ the widely used multinomial logit model (MNL) to investigate the impact of popularity bias on consumer choices. In particular, we examine how popularity bias affects marginal revenue, pricing decisions, and market shares. Moreover, we highlight that ignoring popularity bias can lead to a suboptimal outcome. As the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we propose a semi-myopic pricing policy, which is computationally tractable, and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality under both formats. Our numerical simulations further indicate that ignoring popularity bias can result in substantial revenue losses, while the semi-myopic pricing policy consistently outperforms other heuristics under both formats. Finally, empirical tests on real data provide a comprehensive procedure for identifying the most appropriate choice models, which offers practical insights for implementation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Revenue Management with Nonparametric Demand Learning and Product Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product returns are prevalent in practice. Many retailers provide lenient free return policies but with specific return window within which customers are allowed to return products. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider a single-product online learning and pricing problem with stochastic product returns. A salient feature is that the demand function, depending on price and return window decisions, is initially unknown and must be learned on the fly. The retailer thus faces the classic exploration-exploitation trade-off. Moreover, we consider an inventory constraint, introducing an additional trade-off between earning revenue and managing inventory. We propose a modeling framework to integrate pricing and return window decisions, and develop a deterministic fluid model that serves as the full-information benchmark. To tackle the learning problem, we design a novel nonparametric learning algorithm that seamlessly integrates inverse stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods. Under mild assumptions on demand and revenue functions, we establish a regret upper bound for our learning algorithm asO(WTlogT), whereWdenotes the number of return window candidates andTdenotes the time horizon. This result aligns with lower bounds established in both online pricing and multi-armed bandit (MAB) literature. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm across various environments. From an operational standpoint, retailers can use our learning framework as a decision-support tool to identify the optimal price and return window.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We deal with a retailer’s multi-product inventory system where customers randomly seek acceptable substitutes if their initial requests are not satisfied. Unsuccessful quests for substitutes would result in lost sales. Motivated by a consulting project as well as other real practices, we also choose to deal with further challenges posed by initially unknown base demand distributions and substitution probabilities; moreover, we aim to develop an offline learning method that (i) takes advantage of given data derived from bygone decisions rather than of any learning-while-doing opportunity, (ii) makes inferences about base-demand distributions and pairwise substitution probabilities without knowing whether there have been demand arrivals after inventory depletions, and (iii) is unhindered by the lack of knowledge about the assortments faced by customers and their purchase-or-no-purchase decisions at their individual arrivals. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator that circumvents unrealistic data requirements. Our substitution probability estimates employ carefully designed weighting schemes to facilitate rigorous theoretical analysis through tools such as the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Both one-time substitution scenarios and more complex Markov-chain substitution patterns would be accommodated. Using large deviation tools, we establish provably optimal convergence rates of our estimates on top of consistency. The precision in parameter estimates would translate into accuracy in replenishment decisions. For inventory management, we take advantage of a submodularity property to obtain an exact algorithm for the two-product case and a good heuristic for the general multi-product problem. Computational studies based on simulated and actual data confirm the merits of our approach.</content>

    <title>Knowledge Behind Firewalls: How Rivalry Among Alliance Partners Constrains Innovation Inside Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations can gain substantial knowledge synergies from their alliance portfolios, and research suggests firms may benefit even more when their partners compete directly with each other. However, firms can only capture such synergies if their own inventors are allowed to freely exchange knowledge obtained from these partners to create novel combinations. We challenge this premise and argue that, because partners in such configurations are more concerned about the risks of knowledge leakage to their rivals, they will pressure the focal firm into imposing credible safeguards that restrict the access and handling of knowledge inside its organization. We predict that the constraints imposed by these safeguards will be reflected in a higher disconnectedness in the focal firm’s inventor collaboration network, with the extent of these constraints tied to the relative technological bargaining power the focal firm holds over its partners. Importantly, these safeguards are not costless, and we predict that the disconnectedness induced will affect the focal firm’s innovation performance by undermining its ability to create and appropriate inventive value. Using a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms, we find consistent support for these arguments. Our study contributes to research on interfirm alliances, intraorganizational networks, and innovation while offering practical insights for managers.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17230 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Loot Boxes to Better Design: Pricing Randomized ProductsRandomized rewards—often described as “mystery packs” or “blind-box” mechanics—are now a familiar feature in many video games. Yet choosing a loot box’s price and the odds of each possible drop is not just a design decision; it is a challenging optimization problem. In their accepted Operations Research paper, “Algorithms for loot box design” (Han, Ryan, and Tong, forthcoming), the authors develop an algorithmic framework for designing loot boxes by selecting a purchase price and item drop probabilities to maximize expected revenue under player choice behavior. They show that the general problem is computationally hard, but also identify economically motivated restrictions on player utilities that make the design problem tractable. When the number of items is fixed, the paper provides an exact polynomial-time algorithm under one class of utility structures and efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees under another. The analysis also links loot-box design to classic pricing ideas, offering guidance on how to translate item-level values and rarity into transparent, well-performing randomized reward systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using career history data from employees’ online profiles, we provide empirical evidence regarding how human resources systems can affect the gender gap in job tenure. Our results indicate that female workers experience shorter average job tenure than male workers. Our results further show that abandoning forced ranking systems helps to narrow this gender gap. We present experimental evidence indicating that in forced ranking environments, women experience shorter tenure than men and are more likely to exit their roles. This is true even when women are on equal footing with men. Finally, we present survey evidence that under forced ranking systems, more women resign as compared with men. In sum, our empirical, experimental, and survey results indicate that forced ranking systems may contribute to a gender gap in job tenure. Accordingly, abandoning such systems may help promote workplace gender equality.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72472068, 72422022, 72272055, 72321001, 72342009, 72325010, and 72172085], the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Chinese Ministry of Education [Grant 22JZD012], Shenzhen Natural Science Foundation [Grant JCYJ20250604144252069], and Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) Faculty Research Grant [Project No. FRG-25-013-MSB].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03264 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An opaque product refers to a subset of products that only differ in some secondary attribute (such as color or style). After a customer purchases an opaque product, one of the products in the subset is then allocated to the customer. Selling opaque products has become popular on e-commerce platforms, because it is a source of flexibility that reduces demand variability and hence inventory cost. In this paper, we seek to understand how the design of opaque product configurations and the fraction of customers choosing opaque products impact the value of flexibility arising from opaque selling. The key finding from our study is the following insight: A modest opaque selling strategy where (i) the opaque options contain small subsets and (ii) only a small fraction of customers buy opaque products achieves substantial cost savings (compared with nonopaque traditional selling). Moreover, the cost savings of this modest opaque strategy is on the same order as a fully flexible scenario where all customers buy an opaque product. Our analysis relies on exploring a novel connection of multiproduct inventory management to the balls-into-bins framework along with a simple balancing policy for opaque selling. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that the simple balancing policy is asymptotically optimal. For extensions outside of our theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that our core insights continue to hold.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 1944428].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2019.02983 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We address the joint assortment and inventory optimization problem for an online retailer facing a set of N substitutable products. The retailer must determine both the assortment and inventories of these products before the start of the selling season to maximize the expected profit. We consider a setting with dynamic SOBS, where consumers’ choices follow the Markov chain choice model. This is a challenging problem, and even computing the expected profit for a given assortment and inventory solution requires solving an intractable dynamic program. We present a sample average approximation-based algorithm for the problem that achieves a regret of [Formula: see text] with respect to an linear program (LP) upper bound. Our algorithm first selects an assortment by balancing the expected revenue (from a single consumer) and the inventory cost. We do this by identifying a subset of products that can pool demand from the universe of substitutable products without significantly cannibalizing the revenue in the presence of dynamic substitution behavior of consumers. We then use a sample average approximation-based LP to decide on the inventory level for each item in the selected assortment. We numerically show that our algorithm considerably improves the performance over standard approaches from the literature on a wide range of instances of the Markov chain choice model and demonstrate that it carefully handles the inventory of products in the long tail (i.e., products with small mean total demand).This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by Amazon [Research Award (V.

    <title>Optimal Contests with Negative Prizes: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the optimal design of contests in the presence of negative prizes and establishes the optimality of a modified all-pay auction with entry fee and reserve. The entry fee always equals the contestants’ liability, and the reserve is weakly higher than in contests without negative prizes. The modification involves awarding all contestants a strictly positive prize if none meet the reserve. This optimal contest better incentivizes high-ability contestants by offering them a higher prize augmented by entry fees, while still ensuring full participation from low-ability contestants. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when contestants’ liability is sufficiently high, the same contest maximizes both the expected total effort and winner’s effort, with both measures increasing with liability. Numerical simulations show that even with low liability, predictions from the two optimal contests are closely aligned. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment comparing optimal contests across different liability levels, confirming the “killing-two-birds-with-one-stone” prediction.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UTS Business School Research Grant, UTS Behavioural Lab Grant and National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72192842, 72203099, 72422018].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03580 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of Online Cart Composition on Cart Abandonment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online shopping cart abandonment is widespread, causing major losses in potential revenues for e-commerce companies. We expand efforts to mitigate cart abandonment by investigating how the cart’s product composition affects abandonment and testing easy-to-implement interventions. We hypothesize that consumers are more likely to abandon carts containing a higher proportion of hedonic relative to utilitarian products. This cart composition effect arises because carts containing higher hedonic-to-utilitarian product ratios are perceived as more hedonic overall, increasing consumer guilt regarding cart purchase, and the likelihood of cart abandonment. Analyses of two large-scale field datasets and four controlled experiments provide converging evidence for the cart composition effect (Studies 1A-3) and the mediating role of perceived hedonism and consumer guilt (Studies 2, 4A, 4B). Substantively, we offer empirical support for a practical and easily implemented intervention: using e-commerce recommendation systems to reduce cart abandonment by suggesting utilitarian items (Studies 4A &amp; 4B). Our findings suggest that recommendation systems may serve as an effective tool for reducing cart abandonment and underscore the importance of incorporating hedonic value considerations into recommendation algorithms. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings for the development of more effective marketing strategies and improving online conversion rates.</content>

    <title>Partisan Cities: How State‐Local Political Alignment Shapes Credit Risk and Information Processing in the Municipal Bond Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how partisan alignment between city leaders and state governors shapes information processing and bond pricing in the municipal bond market. Using a novel data set on 1,045 U.S. cities from 2005 to 2019, we show that cities with the same political affiliation as the state governor face 9 basis points lower borrowing costs than misaligned cities. The effect is stronger for riskier bonds, in states where governors hold greater authority, and for fiscally dependent cities. Aligned cities also receive more aid during fiscal distress. Partisan alignment shapes how investors interpret and respond to financial information: Nondisclosure and adverse audit findings raise borrowing costs primarily for misaligned cities, while penalties for aligned cities are markedly smaller.</content>

    <title>Reactions by Actual Data Breach Victims over Time: Evidence from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica Breach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a data breach happens, both victims, whose data were breached, and nonvictims react negatively but not equally so. In this study, we used Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach to identify to what extent reactions of data breach victims go beyond those of nonvictims. Our findings reveal that victims initially lose more trust, feel more violated, feel more strongly that a psychological contract has been breached, feel less belonging on Facebook, and intend to continue using Facebook less. However, these effects are short-lived, disappearing within six months. Intuitively, one might assume that this is because people are locked in on Facebook and are forced to change their attitudes because they cannot change their behavior by leaving it. Surprisingly, a follow-up experiment shows that this is not the case as we found people who are less locked in to improve their attitudes more over time. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that consumers are unable to act when their data are breached and their privacy is violated and that regulation may be needed to better protect data. The short-lived nature of victims’ reactions we identified in this case also raises questions about the role of postbreach compensation in different contexts.</content>

    <title>The power of expressed humility: Early stage investors' reaction to humble entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how entrepreneur‐expressed humility affects early stage investors' willingness to fund new ventures. In pitching contexts where investors rely on relational cues and implicit prototypes of entrepreneurs, we theorize three distinct pathways through which expressed humility shapes funding decisions. First, building on research regarding interpersonal signals in early stage valuation, we propose that humility fosters perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, increasing investors' willingness to fund. Second, drawing on implicit leadership theories, we argue that humility may trigger negative perceptions regarding the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Across a videometric analysis of 140 real‐world pitches and a randomized experiment with French early stage investors, we show that expressed humility elicits both pathways, but investors prioritize positive attributions.Managerial SummaryAlthough humility is often regarded as a positive leadership trait, it contradicts implicit prototypes of successful entrepreneurs, who are typically seen as dominant and assertive. We examine how early stage investors perceive and respond to displays of humility during pitches. We propose that entrepreneur‐expressed humility produces ambiguous effects: It enhances perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, but raises doubts about the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Using a videometric analysis of 140 pitches from the French version ofShark Tankand a randomized experiment with venture capital investors, we find evidence for these competing pathways. Overall, investors prioritize the positive attributions of interpersonal skills, suggesting that entrepreneurs benefit from expressing humility when pitching.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper “Pre-hedging” studies a dealer that pre-hedges an anticipated potential trade and analyses how this affects the client’s overall execution outcome. It shows that pre-hedging can benefit both parties: Improved risk management over an extended horizon then enables the dealer to charge reduced spreads that more than offset any adverse impact the pre-hedging activity has on the execution price. However, when a dealer pre-hedges too aggressively, this can be detrimental to the client. Timing uncertainty of the potential trade is an effective control held by the client to mitigate any counterproductive pre-hedging. Our results are robust to a setting where competing dealers simultaneously pre-hedge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multiasset Optimal Execution via Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic ControlIn “Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic Optimal Control Without Explicit Solution,” Dupret and Hainaut introduce the generalized policy iteration physics-informed neural network, a novel deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems even when the optimal control does not admit explicit solution. The method combines physics-informed neural networks with an actor-critic structure based on generalized policy iteration and uses separate networks to approximate both the value function and the multidimensional optimal control. This approach provides a global approximation of the solution across time and space, enabling fast online evaluation. Theoretical guarantees on convergence and optimality are provided, whereas its accuracy and efficacy are empirically validated through two important numerical examples from operations research. Thereby, the authors generalize the Almgren–Chriss framework arising from optimal execution in finance by allowing both temporary and permanent price impacts to be fully nonlinear and by considering a multidimensional setting with multiple cointegrated assets.</content>

    <title>Network‐Enabled Responses to Deglobalization: Examining How Firms Strategize During Eras of Global Disruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent research has shown how cycles of globalization and deglobalization can disrupt firms and networks. Understanding this process requires a historical perspective on how firms and networks coordinate, strategize, and respond to the effects of deglobalization. This paper examines firm‐level, network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization by analysing a selection of key firms operating within the Liverpool (UK) and New York (USA) networks at the turn of the nineteenth century. The case study analyses firms within a broader network structure through network visualization, supplemented by various archival data sources. We explore the strategic responses of multiple firms and demonstrate how the network supported them, enabling them to address the challenges posed by deglobalization. We identify five categories of network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization: reinforcement, adaptation, shared risk, lobbying, and exit.</content>

    <title>Content Exclusivity on Advertising Revenue–Sharing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch rely on third-party providers and share advertising revenue to incentivize content production. Yet, as providers increasingly distribute content across multiple platforms, competition intensifies and platforms consider exclusive contracts to restrict providers’ multihoming behavior. Our research develops an analytical model to examine when exclusive contracts benefit or harm platforms, providers, consumers, and overall welfare. We find that exclusivity has two key forces: it limits the number of providers on each platform, reducing same-side crowding, but it also weakens the effectiveness of revenue sharing as a competitive tool for attracting providers. As a result, exclusivity benefits platforms only when consumers place low marginal value on content, leading platforms to offer lower sharing rates and earn higher profits. When consumer valuation is high, exclusivity can backfire, reducing platform profits. Importantly, exclusivity can increase provider surplus and even generate win–win outcomes for both platforms and providers at intermediate valuation levels. Although exclusivity reduces consumer surplus because of fewer providers, total social welfare may still increase because of reduced competition costs among providers. These findings suggest policymakers should take a nuanced stance toward regulating content exclusivity.</content>
