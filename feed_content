    <title>Inventor Commingling and Innovation in Technology Start-up Acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore a form of postacquisition integration by which inventors from the target and acquiring organizations share and integrate technological and organizational knowledge, performing joint research and development. We refer to this phenomenon as inventor commingling. Grounded in the knowledge-based view, we posit that commingling enhances the target firm’s innovation performance by enabling the transfer of the acquirer’s organizational knowledge, preserving the target’s existing knowledge base. We explore how commingling differs from structural integration and how the two forms of integration can be combined for postacquisition management. We posit that commingling diminishes the negative effects of structural integration, whereas structural integration may enhance the efficacy of commingling. Because organizational knowledge is firm-specific and cumulative, commingling efficacy should increase with acquirer commingling inventors’ tenure. To test these predictions, we assemble a large sample of acquisitions to study the effect of these forms of postacquisition integration on acquired entity innovation outcomes. Our results support a positive commingling innovation effect, which is more pronounced under structural integration. A high degree of commingling can mitigate the negative effects of postacquisition structural integration documented in the literature. We use direct flights between the acquisition party locations as an instrument to address the potentially endogenous process of inventor commingling. We find consistent results. Our study raises the possibility of inventor commingling as a distinct form of postacquisition integration, which holds the potential of effectively transferring organizational knowledge and supporting postacquisition innovation output, sidestepping the classic postacquisition integration–autonomy trade-off.Funding: This work was supported by Henry Crown Institute of Business Research at Tel-Aviv University; Mack Institute for Innovation Management at Wharton; Wharton Global Initiatives Research Funding Program.</content>

    <title>Seeing Both Sides: How Shared Experience Can Improve Entrepreneur Evaluations of Investors Through Perceived Empathy</title>
    <updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarly attention in the venture funding literature is primarily devoted to tie selection, with a great deal of that attention focused on the perspective of the investor evaluating the entrepreneur as a candidate for funding. But venture funding can be conceptualized as a long-term, dual-sided matching process. Two mixed methods studies offer support for a specific basis of background similarity that can influence entrepreneur evaluations of investor tie potential: shared entrepreneurial experience. An archival study of 677 entrepreneurs evaluating 408 investors demonstrates that investors with entrepreneurial experience are more likely to be perceived as empathetic than investors without this experience. In turn, entrepreneurs rate investors whom they perceive to be empathetic more favorably than those they do not perceive to be empathetic. Perceived empathy thus emerges as a mechanism that serves to mediate the positive relationship between shared entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneur ratings of investors. A preregistered between-subjects experiment conducted on 481 entrepreneurs exposed to otherwise comparable investor profiles randomized for experience complements the correlational evidence from the archival study with causal support for each of these paths. Shedding light on the key components of perceived empathy, linguistic analyses indicate the extent to which cognitive perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur thinks) and affective perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur feels) mediate the effect. Gender implications are discussed as this work also documents that women are less likely to traverse the path from entrepreneurship into investing, restricting their ability to reap these relational upsides.Funding: This research was supported by faculty budgets at London Business School and Georgetown University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18429 .</content>

    <title>Single paper meta‐analysis is unavoidable</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advocate that the multiple studies of a common phenomenon that are featured in a typical behavioral research paper be jointly analyzed to provide a statistical summary of the set of studies as a whole. Indeed, we view such single paper meta‐analysis as unavoidable in typical behavioral research papers because (i) such papers feature multiple studies of a common phenomenon, (ii) such papers contain summaries of those studies, and (iii) statistical summaries of studies (i.e., meta‐analyses) are superior to non‐statistical summaries of them. Nonetheless, the current dominant practice is for such papers to feature separate statistical analyses of the data from each of the studies but to contain a non‐statistical summary of the multiple studies rather than a statistical summary. We believe that this is regrettable and therefore aim to rectify matters. Consequently, we review some considerations about meta‐analysis and statistical analysis more broadly; compare single paper meta‐analysis to traditional meta‐analysis and illustrate its benefits via a case study; discuss and dismiss concern about single paper meta‐analysis; and discuss single paper meta‐analysis and the review process.</content>

    <title>A General-Purpose IT Intervention to Improve Human Decision Making, Strengthen Passwords, and Reduce Receptivity to Misinformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <title>A tale of two biases: Unpacking the relationship of overestimation and overprecision on firm performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <title>Public support and &lt;scp&gt;VC&lt;/scp&gt; financing in academic startups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate public support and venture capital (VC) investment in academic startups. Government support may enable follow‐on investment by providing a quality signal to investors. This signal is especially important for academic startups, which face large funding gaps due to their complexity, cutting‐edge nature, and uncertainty regarding the founders' management capabilities and commitment. Using a panel of startups in Germany, our analyses confirm that academic startups are more likely to obtain follow‐on VC investment after receiving public support than non‐academic startups. Further, this effect is limited in time, lasts longer for academic startups, is concentrated in high‐tech manufacturing firms, and is stronger for investments from business angels. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking to foster academic entrepreneurship through policy programs and VC investment.Managerial SummaryObtaining seed and growth capital is essential for potentially highly innovative startups. We show that startups that obtain public support are more likely to receive VC funding and that this effect is stronger for startups with academic founders, approximately twice as large. We further show that this benefit is limited in time, concentrated in the high‐tech manufacturing industry, and more salient for business angel financing than for investment by independent VC funds or corporate VCs. For founders of academic startups, our results imply that acquiring public support might enhance the chances of attracting follow‐on financing.</content>

    <title>Real option portfolios and the theory of the multinational enterprise: understanding modes of international involvement in the digital economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <title>Learning When Reading: Evidence from an Online Mobile Reading Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <title>Perceptions of knowledge transferability and entrepreneurial entry: The role of firm‐initiated turnover</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the understudied effects of perceived non‐transferable knowledge on labor market choices after firm‐initiated turnover. Using a large, nationally representative dataset, I assess how workers' perceptions of knowledge transferability, expectations to remain at a firm, and type of turnover experienced correlate with the decision to engage in entrepreneurship. I find that the release of workers with perceived non‐transferable knowledge into the external environment through firm‐initiated turnover reliably foreshadows entrepreneurship, especially as workers' prior expectations to continue wage employment at a source firm increases. This finding indicates that beyond necessity, opportunity and financial resources, workers' self‐perceptions of their human capital and unfulfilled career expectations matter to the choice of entrepreneurship. It also suggests that firm‐initiated turnover may be a form of knowledge divestiture with important ex‐post implications when workers' perceptions of transferability align with reality.Managerial SummaryManagers often overlook the role of employees' self‐perceptions in shaping post‐turnover career decisions. This study highlights that workers who perceive their knowledge as non‐transferable—skills and expertise they believe cannot easily be applied to other employers—are more likely to pursue entrepreneurship following firm‐initiated turnover. This trend is particularly pronounced among workers who expected to remain in wage employment but were unexpectedly terminated. Firm‐initiated turnover, while serving to shed human capital, can inadvertently encourage the creation of entrepreneurial ventures that may compete with the firm. To mitigate unintended outcomes, firms should (a) recognize the strategic implications of firm‐initiated turnover as a form of knowledge divestiture, with implications for both the firm and the broader market, (b) reevaluate how they manage exits for employees with the firm's specialized knowledge, to reduce the risk of competitive ventures, and (c) engage in open dialogue to align employee expectations with organizational strategies, considering retention or redeployment options for those at risk of a forced exit. By understanding how workers' perceptions and unmet expectations influence their career paths, firms can make more informed decisions about human capital management and turnover strategies, potentially reducing unintended competitive risks while fostering long‐term relationships with former employees.</content>

    <title>The Determinants of ESG Ratings: Rater Ownership Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how common ownership affects Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—an important research question given the increasing use of these ratings in investment decisions and corporate evaluations. We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</content>

    <title>Incentive alignment in ecosystems: The role of complementarity types and multi‐sided bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alignment of incentives to improve value creation in ecosystems is crucial to their growth and survival. We examine how two fundamental ecosystem features affect alignment: types of complementarities and their interplay with multi‐sided bargaining over value. Using a formal model, we find that multi‐sided bargaining typically causes misalignment, in patterns that vary dramatically depending on the type of complementarities. For instance, we find that multiplicative complementarities typically entail weak alignment among participants. In contrast, when value creation is constrained by the weakest component, alignment can be alternatively very strong or very weak. We also find that the starting levels of participants' functionality matter. This suggests new avenues for assessing ecosystem performance and the potential for alignment among participants.Managerial SummaryManagers of firms operating in ecosystems need to understand the factors that make their partners aligned with the objective of increasing the ecosystem's value creation. Our research shows that, under multi‐sided bargaining, a major driver of incentive alignment is the type of complementarity between ecosystem's components, that is, how the different pieces of the ecosystem contribute to value creation. Depending on the complementarity type (multiplicative, additive, and weakest‐link), and ecosystem partners' starting levels of functionalities, we show which combinations are intrinsically favorable for aligning development incentives and which ones may undermine alignment. These findings can serve as a guide to diagnose the potential for misalignment among ecosystem partners and how much value creation is at stake.</content>

    <title>Mobilizing the silent majority: Discourse broadening and audience support for entrepreneurial innovations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs operating in a public interactional domain face a unique communicative challenge: they must leverage conversations with a small subset of vocal discursive partners to mobilize support from a broader base of silent audiences observing these exchanges. I propose that entrepreneurs who engage with these vocal discursive partners using what I refer to asdiscourse broadeningare more likely to successfully gain support from the broader silent audience. Using a computational linguistics model to analyze discourses on an online platform featuring entrepreneurial innovations, this study finds an inverted U‐shaped relationship between discourse broadening and support from silent audience members. This relationship is moderated by the similarity between the interpretative lenses of discursive partners and silent audience members, which influences the trade‐off between the benefits and costs of discourse broadening.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face the critical challenge of persuading broader audiences to support their novel ideas despite having limited opportunities to interact with them directly. This article examines how entrepreneurs can strategically engage with their immediate conversational partners on online platforms to gain support from a wider base of silent observers. The findings show that entrepreneurs must carefully balance the extent to which they broaden the discourse with their conversational partners to maximize support from the broader audience. They also need to tailor the level of discourse broadening based on how much their conversational partners represent the views of silent observers. These insights reveal a discursive strategy that entrepreneurs can leverage on online platforms to increase the likelihood of success in commercializing their innovations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human decision-makers frequently override the recommendations generated by predictive algorithms, but it is unclear whether these discretionary overrides add valuable private information or reintroduce human biases and mistakes. We develop new quasi-experimental tools to measure the impact of human discretion over an algorithm on the accuracy of decisions, even when the outcome of interest is only selectively observed, in the context of bail decisions. We find that 90% of the judges in our setting underperform the algorithm when they make a discretionary override, with most making override decisions that are no better than random. Yet the remaining 10% of judges outperform the algorithm in terms of both accuracy and fairness when they make a discretionary override. We provide suggestive evidence on the behavior underlying these differences in judge performance, showing that the high-performing judges are more likely to use relevant private information and are less likely to overreact to highly salient events compared to the low-performing judges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s innovation activity is often judged by the number and type of new products it launches, butwhenthese products are introduced may be equally important, especially before going public. This research investigates how the temporal pattern of new product introductions (NPIs) influences a firm’s initial public offering (IPO) value. The analysis uses data from 298 firms that went public between 2006 and 2023, and focuses on three patterns of timing: recency (how recently the latest product was launched before the IPO), dispersion (the degree to which NPIs before the IPO are spread out over time), and asymmetry (how disproportionately NPIs were launched over time before the IPO). Results demonstrate that firms with more dispersed NPIs achieve higher IPO value, whereas firms that introduce a product just before the IPO or introduce several new products disproportionately closer to the IPO tend to perform worse. Findings show that 1% increases in recency, dispersion, or asymmetry result in a 1.34% decrease, 3.65% increase, and 1.03% decrease, respectively, in IPO value, and these vary depending on the firm’s industry growth and product innovativeness. Results provide new insights for theory and practice, highlighting that innovation timing is a key determinant of IPO performance.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Cryptocurrencies*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores U.S. public firms’ cryptocurrency holdings and accounting practices from 2013 to 2022 against the backdrop of the recently enacted crypto accounting rule, ASU 2023‐08. Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manipulated consumer reviews are a growing concern for digital platforms, undermining trust and distorting market outcomes. This study analyzes data from the Apple App Store to assess how both positive and negative manipulated reviews—later filtered by the platform—affect app sales rankings. Surprisingly, both one-star and five-star manipulated reviews initially boost app rankings, even when one-star reviews are intended to harm competitors. These effects can persist for weeks and take up to six months to reverse through platform filtering. Using text analysis, we find that negative manipulated reviews are linguistically more distinguishable from organic ones than are positive manipulated reviews, making them easier for consumers to spot. Our results show that review volume often outweighs valence in influencing consumer behavior, and that manipulated reviews have stronger effects on free apps, gaming apps, and apps from large developers. These findings underscore the urgency for platform managers to invest in faster, more accurate filtering systems, and highlight the need for policymakers to strengthen governance mechanisms to protect marketplace integrity and consumer trust.</content>

    <title>Transferring, Eliminating, or Both? The Strategic Impact of Resale Platforms and Consumer Learning on Coping with Consumer Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For sellers of experience goods, consumer uncertainty threatens profits. Resale platforms and enhanced consumer learning are popular tools to manage this uncertainty, but their impacts differ significantly and require tailored strategies. Our research reveals critical nuances overlooked by prior studies: the resale platform’s negative effect is often underestimated because of its indirect influence on consumer waiting behavior, whereas consumer learning can harm sellers of high-cost goods when consumers are impatient. Critically, the profitability and environmental outcomes depend on production costs and consumer patience. Encouraging consumer learning creates a profit-environment win–win with patient consumers, whereas resale platforms excel with impatient consumers and high costs. Combining both mechanisms benefits sellers only when consumers are patient and costs are moderate ([Formula: see text]"). Key strategic imperatives emerge: (i) resale behavior: encourage selectively (beneficial mainly for high-cost goods), minimizing resale discounts; (ii) learning behavior: nurture consumer patience and avoid rushing purchases, especially for premium goods; and (iii) product upgrades: avoid frequent, minor updates. Sellers must move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches, aligning their uncertainty management (resale, learning, upgrades) with product economics and consumer patience to optimize profits and sustainability.</content>

    <title>A Walrasian Mechanism with Markups for Nonconvex Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce markup equilibrium—an extension of Walrasian equilibrium in which consumers pay a fixed percentage markup over producer prices. In quasilinear markets, markup equilibria exist despite nonconvexities. They are resource-feasible and envy-free, incur no budget deficit, and require little more communication and computation than ordinary Walrasian equilibrium. The associated markup mechanism is asymptotically incentive-compatible. We also introduce a Bound-Form First Welfare Theorem, which states that for any feasible allocation, the welfare loss compared to the first-best is bounded, using any price vector, by the sum of the resulting (i) budget surplus and (ii) rationing losses suffered by the participants. Using producer prices, this bound implies that any markup equilibrium with a small markup and few unallocated goods is nearly efficient.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper shows that competing firms with competitive advantages in distinct attributes can credibly coordinate their messaging about attribute importance, reducing consumer uncertainty and generating category demand. A truthful equilibrium arises in which each firm highlights the more important attribute—even when at a disadvantage—but such an equilibrium does not exist without competition.</content>

    <title>Core or periphery: Examining where to allocate heterogeneous inventors and the impact on firms' innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms should allocate their inventors to network locations to achieve their best innovation performance. We use an NK model to model the interactions between key factors that influence a firm's innovation: (a) individuals' embeddedness within the firm's network, (b) individuals' heterogeneity across their search distance as well as their adoption (i.e., imitation) propensity, and (c) the complexity of the firm's landscape. We find that in high‐complexity landscapes, firms benefit from allocating low‐adopter agents to the core and high‐adopters to the periphery, thereby promoting more independent search at the core. The opposite is true for low complexity landscapes. We further find that when agent types are unknown, individuals should be allocated based on their adoption propensity versus search distance.Managerial SummaryWhere should firms locate their heterogeneous inventors within their networks? Simulating a complex innovation landscape, our study focuses on the interaction of three essential factors that may influence firms' innovation: the location of inventors in the core (embedded position) or periphery of a firm's structure, the distance inventors search for solutions, and the adoption propensity with which inventors will imitate their peers' solutions versus being independent and following their own trajectory. Our results show that firms benefit by placing independent searchers who also search far at the core of the firm when facing highly complex problems, and at the periphery otherwise. Though search distance and adoption propensity have substitutive effects on innovation performance, firms should allocate based on inventors' adoption propensity to lower innovation‐performance variance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study repurchase options (repo contracts) in a competitive asset market with adverse selection. Gains from trade emerge from a liquidity need, but private information about asset quality prevents the full realization of trades. In equilibrium, a single repo contract pools all assets. The embedded repurchase option mitigates adverse selection by improving the volume of trades relative to outright sales. However, liquidity provision can be inefficiently low as lenders compete to attract high-quality assets via high haircuts and low rates. The equilibrium has a closed form and aligns well with empirical patterns across Mortgage-Backed Securities repos.</content>

    <title>Status-Amplified Deterrence: Paul Manafort’s Prosecution Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents often struggle to deter organizational deviance. We propose a theory of “status-amplified deterrence” wherein enforcement’s deterrent effects are amplified when carried out against high-status organizational actors. First, this enforcement is interpreted as willingness and ability for far-reaching enforcement. Next, amplified deterrence occurs as these episodes become widely known through (1) extensive media coverage and (2) the marketing efforts of third-party compliance advisors. We examine this theory in the context of the U.S. Department of Justice’s enforcement against Paul Manafort for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that enforcement against Manafort caused a widespread, sustained, and economically significant reduction in FARA noncompliance. We show supplementary evidence consistent with the idea that deterrence was amplified in significant part by media attention and by law firms referencing the episode while successfully marketing FARA advisory services. We contribute to literature illuminating how organizations, in conjunction with third-party compliance advisors, adjust deviant activities in response to shifting regulatory environments.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18754 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Glossy Premium: Effects of Product Glossiness on Consumer Judgments of First-Hand and Second-Hand Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers demonstrate a preference for products with glossy surfaces. This research examines how and why product glossiness influences consumers’ product preference in the first-hand versus second-hand markets. Six studies demonstrate that consumers generally prefer products with a glossy, as opposed to a matte, surface in both first-hand and second-hand markets. The preference for product glossiness is driven by the heightened recency (pristineness) perception of glossy products in the first-hand (second-hand) market. In addition, in line with these mechanisms, the positive effect of product glossiness on consumer preference is reversed for time-enhanced products (i.e., product quality and value improve with age) in the first-hand market and diminished when diagnostic prior product usage information is available to consumers in the second-hand market. Findings in this research contribute to a deeper understanding of visual marketing and product newness by verifying how visual glossiness induces two different interpretations of product newness in the first-hand and second-hand markets. This research offers practical implications for product design and presentation in the first-hand market, as well as refurbishing and resale strategies in the second-hand market, suggesting ways to communicate a consistent brand image and enhance product preference more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how deskilling technology (map apps) affects the choice of individuals to provide ride‐hail service. In a vignette experiment, technology increased participation in work by 8% and 4% among low‐ and high‐skill drivers respectively. Technology can increase participation by raising productivity or affording an amenity (reducing disutility of work). A field experiment revealed that the technology afforded more amenity to low‐skill drivers and they incurred more stress when driving without technology. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce wage pressures.Managerial SummaryTechnologies that deskill work may afford an amenity by reducing the disutility of work. In formulating technology strategy, managers must consider how the amenity varies by worker skill and how it affects the supply of labor. In the context of ride‐hail drivers, we show that navigation technology affords an amenity. The amenity is larger and the effect of technology on increasing labor supply is more pronounced among drivers with less skill. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce pressures for higher wages from low‐skilled workers.</content>

    <title>On the Optimal Design of a Financial Stability Fund</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of a Financial Stability Fund (the “Fund” henceforth) for a union of sovereign countries. By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.</content>

    <title>Complementarity in Future Selves: How Networks of Future-Oriented Cognitive Representations Influence Individuals’ Ability to Proactively and Adaptively Manage Their Career</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When thinking about one’s future work life and career with its seemingly endless possibilities, individuals rarely have a singular “put together” vision of their future self, in which all components neatly fit together. We investigate how the complementarity of a future self impacts an individual’s efforts to work toward their desired future career. We conceptualize and operationalize a future self as a network of future-oriented cognitive representations and complementarity as the extent of mutually beneficial connections in this network. We propose that future self complementarity amplifies the energizing effect of activated future self representations as it spreads across the network, enhancing vitality, and thus promoting proactive career behavior. In Study 1, we developed and validated a network-based measure to capture future self complementarity. In Study 2, we found, in a temporally lagged sample of 517 employees at 11 organizations, an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior through vitality. Study 3, a preregistered causal chain experiment, provided further support for this link. In Study 4, a preregistered field experiment, we again found an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior, assessed using a scale as well as a behavioral measure, via vitality.Funding: Financial support from a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency as part of the “Investissements d’Avenir” program [ANR-16-IDEX-008]; a grant from the Community for Learning &amp; Innovation at Erasmus University Rotterdam; and by the ESSEC Research Center is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18204 .</content>

    <title>The Robin Hood Effect in Transgressions Against Firms: How Political Ideology Shapes Consumer Justifications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer transgressions against firms involve moral violations in which consumers take advantage of loopholes in companies’ return and satisfaction-guaranteed policies or the lack of strict enforcement against password sharing, piracy, shoplifting, wardrobing, coupon stacking, promotion abuse, and fraud. Drawing on the timeless tale of Robin Hood, the legendary outlaw who stands up against injustice, the authors demonstrate that consumers use a Robin Hood justification to legitimize their transgressions against firms. Building on moral foundations theory, this research demonstrates that political ideology impacts consumers’ transgression behavior and the perceived morality of these practices. Six studies show that under certain conditions in which the moral virtues of fairness and care are cued, liberals are more likely to engage in transgressions than conservatives. The studies further test factors that can intensify or mitigate consumer transgressions against firms. Findings from this research can help marketers better understand how consumers justify transgressions and how to effectively reduce these costly and pervasive behaviors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHospital-affiliated online health communities (OHCs) offer a powerful tool to enhance off-line care quality and promote health equity. This study reveals that, when physicians participate in OHCs, their patients experience a 3.87% reduction in mortality risk and a 4.63% increase in recovery rates. A key mechanism is the improvement in care continuity—better care coordination and stronger patient–provider relationships—facilitated by online interactions. Crucially, these benefits are significantly more pronounced for patients with low socioeconomic status, demonstrating OHCs’ potential to reduce healthcare disparities. To maximize impact, healthcare providers should actively encourage physician engagement in OHCs, integrate these platforms with existing health records, and promote their use among disadvantaged populations. Policymakers can leverage OHCs as a strategic tool to advance equitable, high-quality care.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why were incumbents able to pioneer and dominate the nascent bionic prosthetic industry, even though entrants represented the majority of the firms investing in this radical technology? To answer this question, our abductive study builds on the novel base principles definition and uses a historical approach to investigate the incubation and early commercialization periods (1974–2018) of bionic prosthetics. We use comprehensive quantitative data on all technological entrants and historical analysis of significant firms to reveal that organizational prehistory affects both the knowledge and intent of technological entrants. Start-ups, incumbents in conventional prosthetics, and established firms in other industries created and integrated subtechnologies into a radical system. Although all firms invested in component technologies, incumbents played a key role as system integrators. Incumbents dominated product commercialization; start-ups captured value through alliances or by being acquired, and established firms in other industries leveraged their knowledge in adjacent value chains as a function of their prior histories and intents. In comparing the virtues of our explanation—the creating radical systems effects—with widely accepted alternative explanations, we develop a more generalized framework of interorganizational dynamics in nascent industries as an endogenous, coevolutionary process that goes beyond explanations that privilege competitive dynamics to also include collaborative dynamics in value creation (and capture).Funding: This paper was funded by the Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets at the University of Maryland, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Strategic Research Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16915 .</content>

    <title>Ecosystem synergies as drivers of acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the structure of ecosystems shapes firms’ acquisition choices. We develop a theoretical framework comprising three levels of ecosystem structure – local interdependence, clusters, and centrality – that could drive choices of M&amp;A targets based on expected ecosystem synergies, a previously undocumented acquisition synergy that creates benefits for the acquirer and the ecosystem overall. Ecosystem synergy is value created through combination of the acquirer and target's ecosystem positions that improves the combined firm's alignment with third‐party complementors. Such synergies manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of the firms’ components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. In the setting of the e‐commerce technology industry, our results show that firms acquire targets to increase local interdependence of their components and their presence in component clusters.Managerial SummaryInnovation ecosystems are critical for firms’ performance. While prior research has established the importance of ecosystems and firms’ positioning within ecosystems, we do not actually know whether and how ecosystem structure shapes firms’ acquisition choices. In this article, we show that M&amp;A targets are not chosen solely for the value created by the acquirer or target, but also for their broader ecosystem synergies. Ecosystem synergies are a previously undocumented acquisition synergy (distinct from internal synergies and market power) that manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of firms’ post‐acquisition components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. We test our theory by mapping the ecosystem structure of 6187 technological components that drives 186 acquisitions in the e‐commerce technology sector during the period 2013 to 2021.</content>

    <title>Normalizations and Misspecification in Skill Formation Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important class of structural models studies the determinants of skill formation and the optimal timing of interventions. In this paper, I provide new identification results for these models and investigate the effects of seemingly innocuous scale and location restrictions on parameters of interest. To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without these additional restrictions and show that important policy-relevant parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact the interpretation of parameters and may affect counterfactuals. Importantly, with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions fix identified parameters and lead to misspecification. Consequently, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables might yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I show how existing estimators can easily be adapted to solve these issues. As a byproduct, this paper also presents a general and formal definition of when restrictions are truly normalizations.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Customization and the Customer Journey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently offer customers the opportunity to customize in addition to buying ready-made products. Although prior research shows that customization can increase product evaluations, purchase intent, and willingness to pay, customers often do not opt into customization. Using a multi-method approach, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that the Customization Journey is dynamic rather than static: an initial customization experience has a lasting impact on the customer journey. Nine years of transaction data from a retailer shows that customers who customize at least one product are more likely to customize again with the retailer; they also spend more, visit more often, and buy more items. Next, we conduct a series of longitudinal experimental studies. By randomly assigning some participants to customize and others to choose among a matched set of products, we disentangle the effects of the customer’s inherent preference for customizing from their experience with customization. We find that an initial experience with customization significantly increases the subsequent likelihood of customization, leading to more favorable outcomes for both the customer and the retailer. Our findings suggest that customizers need not be “born”—they can be “created” via interventions designed to increase experience with customization, shaping the trajectories of customer journeys.</content>

    <title>The extent and drivers of internal agglomeration of U.S. multi‐unit firms</title>
    <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the extent and determinants of internal agglomeration—the spatial clustering of establishments within firms. It introduces a novel methodology that benchmarks a firm's spatial footprint against that of comparable stand‐alone firms, yielding a firm‐level measure of internal agglomeration. Applied across sectors of the U.S. economy, the approach reveals that internal agglomeration is widespread but varies by industry and firm characteristics. It is more prevalent in service, non‐tradable, and labor‐intensive industries, and is especially pronounced among diversified firms. Among potential drivers, labor similarity consistently predicts intra‐firm colocation, while input–output and knowledge linkages are less influential. These findings bring a spatial lens to corporate strategy, showing that when key resources—particularly labor—face geographic frictions, colocating related activities enhances opportunities for sharing and redeployment.Managerial SummaryMany firms are known to colocate or cluster with other firms in related industries to reap the benefits of sharing specialized inputs, labor, and knowledge. We study whether multi‐unit firms can generate similar benefits by colocating their establishments. We examine the geographic distribution of establishments of multi‐unit firms using comprehensive data on the U.S. economy. We find that over half of all firms colocate their establishments significantly more than would be expected if these belonged to independent firms. Firms are especially likely to colocate establishments with similar labor requirements, which suggests a deliberate strategy to leverage internal labor synergies. Our findings suggest that managers should consider the potential benefits of internal resource sharing when selecting locations, particularly to capitalize on synergies from resources that are less geographically mobile.</content>

    <title>How Does Prepopulating Search Bars with Keywords Affect Online Consumer Behavior? A Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Search aid technologies, especially prepopulated search bars, are increasingly being adopted by major players in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of prepopulating search bars with keywords on online consumer journey. In this study, I design and run a randomized field experiment on a large e-commerce platform involving 72,587 consumers who were randomly exposed to three types of keywords prefilled in the search bar. Individual consumer–level analyses reveal that prepopulating trending category keywords encourages users to discover and buy items from the suggested category without reducing queries using self-entered keywords, ultimately leading to a 10.4% (8.8%) increase in purchase incidence (spending) compared with the counterfactual outcomes when the search bar is empty. Prepopulating personalized keywords brings about more focused product searching within the category recently browsed by users, resulting in a 21% (17%) increase in purchase incidence (spending), although this is offset by the negative effect of a reduction in queries using self-entered keywords. Exposure to niche category keywords is found to have little impact. This study also finds that a prepopulated search bar does not cannibalize the other navigation tool, making it a beneficial addition to the focal e-commerce platform’s business outcomes. These findings, contributing to the literature on consumer search and product recommendation strategies for digital platforms, carry timely implications for e-commerce managers.History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0793 .</content>

    <title>Digital Development: Reimagining Research Beyond ICT4D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions: digital in development (institutional use), digital for development (conscious design for outcomes), and development in a digital world (digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development.</content>

    <title>Right on cue? Category‐switching in online marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and why do producers change the categorization of their offerings? Prior categorization research assumes that producers engage in ongoing efforts to proactively optimize their categorical positioning, but this assumption may not hold for many producers due to their limited attentional capacity. Our theoretical account instead highlights the role of expectation violation cues—salient pieces of information indicating a violation of audience expectations—as triggers that can lead producers to revise their category choice. Our longitudinal study of 84,667 Airbnb hosts' categorization choices finds that negative customer reviews—an important form of expectation violation cue—significantly increase the likelihood of category‐switching, particularly in categories with heterogeneous expectations. Our study suggests that many producers might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.Managerial SummaryHow businesses categorize their products and services influences their commercial success; yet, there exists very limited understanding of when, why, and how businesses revise their category choices. Our study, which tracked the category choices of over 80,000 Airbnb hosts over time, reveals that Airbnb hosts most commonly switch categories after receiving negative customer reviews, particularly when a review indicates that the accommodation did not meet customer expectations and if the previously chosen category lacks a clearly defined set of expected features. When switching categories, hosts tend to choose categories that are relatively similar to their prior choices and that seem to accommodate a wide variety of offerings. These patterns suggest that many businesses might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.</content>

    <title>Competing through category interaction codes: An inhabited view of category strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces category interaction codes—knowledge regarding the expected interactions around entities in a given category—as a critical dimension of category strategy. Through historical analysis of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we demonstrate how these codes shape strategic categorization and competitive dynamics. We show that firms can exploit ambiguous interaction codes to access advantageous decision makers and organizational routines, circumventing entrenched competitors. Further, firms can institutionalize preferred interaction codes through product design, reshaping category prototypes and market dynamics. However, overcommitment to specific interaction codes creates competitive vulnerabilities when market conditions shift. By developing an “inhabited” view of categories that emphasizes socially embedded practices, this study reveals how market categories are enacted through interactions and offers new insights into category‐based competition.Managerial SummaryThis study introducescategory interaction codes—expectations about where, when, how and by whom products are evaluated, used, and purchased within a market. Using the case of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we show that companies can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging and reconfiguringcategory interaction codes. For example, Wang Laboratories sidestepped direct competition with IBM by categorizing its products for engineers and department managers rather than MIS executives, and outperformed IBM in word processing by innovating how actors interact with the new category. For managers, the key insight is that success depends not only on product features but also on how your product fits into the daily decisions, roles, and behaviors that define a category.</content>

    <title>The role of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; integrity in M&amp;amp;A decision‐making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the influence of CEO characteristics on M&amp;A decisions has long spurred researchers’ interest, little attention has been devoted to the ramifications of CEO integrity—the adherence to generally accepted norms and standards. We investigate how CEO integrity influences different stages of the M&amp;A decision process. Specifically, we argue that while CEO integrity reduces self‐serving behavior, it may also become a golden cage that constrains CEOs’ latitude of action. Accordingly, we find that CEO integrity decreases the probability of Type I errors (errors of commission) but increases the probability of Type II errors (errors of omission) in M&amp;A decision‐making. We contribute to theory development by putting forward CEO integrity as an important personality construct for upper echelons research to build on and extend further.Managerial SummaryThis paper examines how CEO integrity influences M&amp;A decision‐making, providing key insights for corporate strategy. Analyzing data from S&amp;P 1500 firms (2006‐2021), we find that CEOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in frequent or large‐scale M&amp;As, particularly avoiding cross‐border deals due to higher uncertainty and potential risks. High‐integrity CEOs also tend to pay lower acquisition premiums and take longer to complete deals, reflecting a cautious and thorough approach. While CEO integrity helps protect firms from costly mistakes it may also lead to missed growth opportunities, indicating a trade‐off between stakeholder considerations and strategic risk‐taking. Boards may need to tailor governance frameworks to optimize the balance between the benefits and constraints of CEO integrity.</content>

    <title>Inheriting Versus Developing Data Analytic Tests and Auditors’ Professional Skepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the use of audit data analytic tests (ADA) becomes increasingly established in practice, auditors will often confront situations in which they inherit ADA developed by others, as opposed to developing the ADA themselves. Despite the potential benefits of ADA, inheriting ADA could decrease auditors’ skeptical actions by diminishing their psychological ownership of the ADA. In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA. Evidence from mediation analyses suggests that these effects are driven by decreased psychological ownership when auditors inherit the ADA.</content>

    <title>Listen Closely: Measuring Vocal Tone in Corporate Disclosures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the usefulness of machine learning approaches for measuring vocal tone in corporate disclosures. We document a substantial mismatch between the widely adopted actor‐based training data underlying these approaches and speech in corporate disclosures. We find that existing models achieve near‐perfect vocal tone classification within their training domain. However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance. Our findings emphasize the importance of a domain‐specific approach to voice analysis in accounting and finance.</content>
