    <title>Digital Distractions with Peer Influence: The Impact of Mobile App Usage on Academic and Labor Market Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns about excessive mobile phone use among youth are mounting. We present estimates of both behavioral and contextual peer effects, along with comprehensive evidence on how students’ own and their peers’ app usage affect academic performance, physical health, and labor market outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data from a Chinese university covering three student cohorts over four years. We exploit random roommate assignments, differential exposure to a policy shock (gaming restrictions for minors), and differential exposure to a discrete event (the introduction of a blockbuster video game) for identification. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own usage by 5.8%. High app usage is harmful across all measured outcomes. A one s.d. increase in app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage reduces a student’s GPAs and wages through both disruptions and behavioral spillovers, generating a total negative effect that exceeds half the magnitude of the impact from the student’s own app usage. Extending China’s three-hour-per-week gaming restriction for minors to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.9%. High-frequency GPS and app usage data show that heavy app users spend less time in study halls, are more frequently late or absent from class, and get less sleep.</content>

    <title>Unintended Consequences of Closing Pay Gaps Across Multiple Groups: A Formal Modeling and Simulation Analysis of Allocation Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, many firms have prioritized both pay equity (i.e., closing pay gaps associated with target groups such as women and racial minorities) and equitable representation (i.e., ensuring these target groups are fairly represented across a firm’s hierarchy). We use formal modeling and simulations to show how efforts to close pay gaps across multiple groups can undermine equitable representation. Specifically, our analysis suggests that pressure for pay equity creates a cost-based financial incentive to enact a subtle form of tokenism: A firm may minimize the cost of closing pay gaps if it maintains a workforce with a small number of minority women whom it pays well in order to compensate for underpaying larger numbers of majority women and minority men who resemble each other in terms of job attributes and personal qualifications. A firm can avoid these outcomes if it focuses on ensuring that employees from target groups are equitably rewarded for job attributes and personal qualifications rather than minimizing cost. But an equitable-rewards approach can be substantially more expensive than a cost-minimization approach, especially if pay gaps are larger in high-wage jobs or if there are many target groups. We conclude by offering testable empirical predictions and recommending a practical solution, namely to include terms for intersectional categories (e.g., minority women) in the regressions used to estimate pay gaps.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18306 .</content>

    <title>Mutual Fund Revenue Sharing in 401(k) Plans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recordkeepers in defined contribution (DC) pension plans are often paid indirectly in the form of revenue sharing from third-party funds on the menu. We show that these arrangements affect the investment menu of 401(k) plans. Revenue-sharing funds are more likely to be added to the menu and are less likely to be deleted. Overall, revenue-sharing plans are more expensive, as higher expense ratios are not offset by lower direct fees or by superior performance. Rebates increase with the market power of the recordkeeper, suggesting that third-party funds may share revenues to gain access to retirement assets.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: The research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the TIAA-CREF Institute through the Pension Research Council/Boettner Center (PRC) of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01560 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Offline Demand Learning and Pricing with Separable Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper, inspired by a collaboration with a leading consumer electronics retailer in the Middle East, explores the challenge of demand learning and pricing using separable demand models. The data scarcity issue, characterized by limited price changes and low sales volumes, renders traditional models ineffective in deriving reasonable price elasticity. To address this issue, we advocate a separable model that leverages two submodels to distinctly capture the effects of price and contextual information. The separable structure enables us to invest special emphasis on the role of price and impose specific structural assumptions on the submodel for pricing effects, such as the monotone decreasing property. Theoretical analysis sheds light on the statistical complexity of demand learning with the separable structure, highlighting its capacity to reduce the necessary sample size to achieve a desired level of accuracy. We also introduce a computationally efficient iterative algorithm for deriving submodels from offline datasets, complete with convergence guarantees. In an empirical context, we demonstrate how our method can yield meaningful price elasticity estimations and revenue increase based on real sales data from the retailer.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Political Heterogeneity and Societal Polarization Impair Individual Performance: Evidence from Random Assignment in Professional Golf</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how political heterogeneity in groups affects individual performance in settings where people work alongside others. Leveraging the random assignment of golfers to groups in Professional Golfers’ Association Tour tournaments, we find that golfers score 0.2 strokes better per round when playing in politically homogeneous versus heterogeneous groups. This corresponds to a five-rank improvement before the tournament cut and an additional $13,000–$23,400 in tournament earnings. The effect intensifies during periods of high societal political polarization and diminishes when polarization is low. We propose that politically heterogeneous groups create a more stressful and less psychologically safe environment, reducing focus and leading to reduced performance. Consistent with this mechanism, analyses of shot-level data reveal that this effect is strongest during driving and putting shots when players are in close physical proximity. Our study contributes to the understanding of how political heterogeneity in groups affects individual performance in competitive settings, with implications for managing ideological differences in organizations.This paper was accepted by Sameer Srivastava, organizations.Funding: The authors appreciate financial help from Yale University and Fox International [fellowship].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01798 .</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Information Exchange Within Groups: The Role of Voting Protocols in U.S. Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complex and important decisions are often made with advice from a committee of experts. But how do a committee’s “rules of engagement” affect the way individuals discuss, how they vote, and ultimately the quality of their collective recommendation? Compiling verbatim transcripts from U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meetings, we study how a 2007 switch from sequential to simultaneous voting procedures changed discussions, information exchange, and decision making. Consistent with past findings, we show that, compared with a sequential voting protocol, simultaneous voting led to a reduction in the likelihood of unanimous votes. Importantly, we show novel evidence that the majority of this reduction in unanimity was mediated by changes in discussion patterns—specifically, by the increased diversity of information surfaced during discussions. We also find evidence of behavioral and linguistic changes that support our theory that voting protocols changed the incentives for members to elicit more diverse information from each other: under simultaneous voting, members exhibited greater equality in talking time, directed a greater proportion of questions to each other, and adopted language that was more positive, authentic, and equal in projecting status and confidence. Finally, we show that recommendations under simultaneous voting were more likely to be accurate, as drugs recommended and approved were less likely to encounter safety-related postmarket events. In sum, voting protocols affect the incentives for individuals to engage in robust discussions, leading to marked improvements in how information is exchanged between individuals, and in the process by which groups of experts arrive at joint recommendations.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03649 .</content>

    <title>The Competitive Ratio of Threshold Policies for Online Unit-Density Knapsack Problems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a wholesale supply chain ordering problem. In this problem, the supplier has an initial stock and faces an unpredictable stream of incoming orders, making real-time decisions on whether to accept or reject each order. What makes this wholesale supply chain ordering problem special is its knapsack constraint; that is, we do not allow partially accepting an order or splitting an order. The objective is to maximize the utilized stock. We model this wholesale supply chain ordering problem as an online unit-density knapsack problem. We study randomized threshold algorithms that accept an item as long as its size exceeds the threshold. We derive two optimal threshold distributions, the first is 0.4324-competitive relative to the optimal off-line integral packing, and the second is 0.4285-competitive relative to the optimal off-line fractional packing. Both results require optimizing the cumulative distribution function of the random threshold, which are challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problems. We also consider the generalization to multiple knapsacks, in which an arriving item has a different size in each knapsack. We derive a 0.2142-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem cannot be more than 0.4605-competitive. This is the first upper bound strictly less than 0.5, which implies the intrinsic challenge of the knapsack constraint. We show how to naturally implement our optimal threshold distributions in the warehouses of a Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on its order data that demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology–Accenture Alliance for Business Analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01577 .</content>

    <title>Appearing Authentic: How Dress Formality Influences Perceived Authenticity in Investment Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article explores the important but understudied topic of authenticity in investment evaluations. Building on research in authenticity and signaling theory, we theorize how visual first impressions, such as clothing, can generate perceptions of authenticity that lead investors to overlook later quality signals, including a lack of prior experience. We found support for our theory in two field studies and a randomized experiment: investors tend to perceive entrepreneurs who are casually dressed as more authentic than those formally dressed, which is associated with higher investor evaluations. Moreover, perceptions of authenticity generated by casual clothes crowd out later signals: Casually dressed entrepreneurs are evaluated highly regardless of their entrepreneurial experience, but formally dressed entrepreneurs are penalized for perceived inexperience. We discuss the implications of our findings for authenticity research, the temporal order of signals, and early-stage investments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents new stylized facts about returns and cashflow growth rates on stocks and housing over decade‐long holding periods. While cashflow growth rates on the two assets comove positively, their returns comove negatively until the Global Financial Crisis and positively thereafter. These facts present a puzzle for representative‐agent models that imply positive return comovement for assets with similar cashflows. I consider a heterogeneous‐agent model with segmented stock and housing markets connected through credit. News about the aggregate economy generates negative return comovement. Recent shifts such as wealthier homebuyers and institutional housing purchases reduce the importance of credit and segmentation.</content>

    <title>To Own or to Rent? The Effects of Transaction Taxes on Housing Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using sales and leasing data, this paper finds three novel effects of a higher property transaction tax: higher buy-to-rent transactions alongside lower buy-to-own transactions despite both being taxed, a lower sales-to-leases ratio, and a lower price-to-rent ratio. This paper explains these facts by developing a search model with entry of investors and households, households choosing to own or rent in the presence of credit frictions, and homeowners deciding when to move house. A higher transaction tax reduces homeowners’ mobility and increases demand for rental properties, which explains the empirical facts and leads to a lower homeownership rate. The deadweight loss is large at 111% of tax revenue, with more than half of this due to distorting decisions to own or rent.</content>

    <title>Conceptual and Theoretical Perspectives on the Human Resource Management–Leadership–Well‐Being Link: Reviewing 20 Years of Empirical Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) practices and leadership (LS) both impact the functioning and experiences of employees at work, or, in other words, their well‐being (WB). Over the last two decades, the body of empirical research on employee WB that considers aspects of HRM and LS has been growing. There is a myriad of theoretical perspectives, such as job resource theories, social exchange theory, and HRM theories, that can serve as the foundation for empirical inquiry. In addition, the interplay between HRM and LS in impacting employee WB can be conceptualized in many different ways, for example, parallel effects, moderation, and mediation. This literature review takes stock of two decades of empirical HRM–LS–WB research, examines its theoretical and conceptual assumptions, and its temporal developments. We find that the field views the link between HRM, LS, and WB predominantly as an exchange between employee and employer, has a strong tendency to combine social exchange theory with other theoretical frameworks, and is shifting to theories that place the employees at the center of inquiry (e.g., motivational theories). In terms of the interplay between HRM, LS, and WB, we observe a shift toward conceptualizations that focus on the enabling potential of LS and HRM for each other as well as models that focus on the indirect—rather than direct—effects of HRM and LS on WB. We discuss the findings and implications for future research.</content>

    <title>The Devil is in the Details: Zooming out in Leadership Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leadership research has evolved towards increasing conceptual and methodological precision, yielding refined constructs and robust empirical insights. However, this editorial argues that a singular focus on precision risks fragmenting the field and distancing scholarship from the complex realities of organizational life. Drawing on contributions fromJMS, this thematic collection illustrates how leadership is a dynamic, contextually embedded phenomenon shaped by interdependent forces. By ‘zooming out’, scholarship can better reflect the messy, adaptive nature of leadership and offer more actionable insights for leaders navigating today’s organizational challenges. We propose a multidimensional framework – breadth, depth, and height – to reintroduce complexity into leadership studies. Breadth captures the diversity of leadership styles and disciplinary perspectives; depth explores the psychological, symbolic, and relational undercurrents of those diverse perspectives; and height examines how diverse perspectives play out differently across hierarchical levels and systems.</content>

    <title>Clashing Climates: How (In)Congruence Between Information Security Climate and Other Organizational Climates Affects Security Policy Compliance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Securing information assets against cyber-attacks requires organizations to bolster employees’ security behaviors, including compliance with information security policies (ISPs). A strong information security climate (ISC) has been found to be a powerful determinant of such behaviors. However, ISC does not exist in isolation, and its effect on ISP compliance can be impacted by other (in)congruent organizational climates that co-exist within an organization, as simultaneously perceived by employees. Drawing on the competing values framework, this research investigates the joint influences of ISC and co-existing climates on ISP compliance. Specifically, we analyze the interplay between ISC and other co-existing climates, considering their complementary or competing nature, and the extent to which employees perceive these climates to have similar (i.e., aligned) or discrepant (i.e., misaligned) magnitudes of intensity within the organization. Using polynomial regression and response surface analysis, we examine how each (mis)aligned condition is associated with ISP compliance. The results highlight the interplay of ISC with co-existing climates and provide nuanced insights into complex and non-linear relationships among these climates.</content>

    <title>From wells to windmills: Resource redeployment and new technology investment in the energy sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how multi‐business firms redeploy resources following an industry shock. Using the case of oil and gas firms diversified into wind power, I show that firms reduced expenditure in oil and gas—particularly on complex offshore projects—while increasing investment in wind after the 2014 oil price crash. These investments tended to involve newer, more powerful technologies (turbines) when co‐located with existing offshore oil and gas assets. The study provides detailed empirical evidence of resource redeployment and documents conditions under which firms shifted away from one industry and pursued more demanding projects in another. The findings underscore the role of asset colocation in shaping redeployment patterns. They also highlight that market‐based inducements may not be sufficient in driving the energy transition.Managerial SummaryHow should firms respond when a core industry experiences a downturn? This study shows that multi‐business firms—specifically oil and gas companies diversified into wind power—responded to the 2014 oil price crash by cutting investment in oil and gas, especially in offshore projects, and increasing investment in wind power. Importantly, firms were more likely to invest in newer, higher‐capacity wind technologies when they could co‐locate these with existing offshore oil and gas assets. These findings suggest that firms facing industry shocks can redeploy resources into more promising sectors, but their propensity to do so may depend on the possibility of leveraging existing assets across domains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), Chinese cities witnessed a paradox: residential land and new house prices surged while transaction volumes plummeted. We attribute this to local governments’ active price management through supply controls, land acquisitions by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), and limits on new home sales permits. Cities more dependent on land sales and land-backed debt before the pandemic experienced greater price increases and price–volume divergence, with LGFVs buying more land at higher prices than other buyers. These interventions helped sustain fiscal financing but deepened developers’ financial distress, revealing unintended consequences of local governments’ fiscal strategies during downturns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conventional item-based collaborative filtering recommender systems display recommended products (RPs) on a focal product’s (FP’s) page based on their co-views and co-purchases, but do not explicitly consider their price differences. While the latitude of price acceptance theory suggests that consumers may avoid purchasing products with significantly different prices from their reference prices, the effect of displaying differently priced RP on the FP’s page remains unclear. On the one hand, consumers may notice the price difference between the RP and FP more because of their joint display on the FP’s page due to distinction bias. On the other hand, consumers may infer the relationship between RP and FP from other consumers’ choices in collaborative filtering recommendation systems (observational learning), reducing the salience of their price differences. We examine the impact of price differences between the RP and FP on product sales using a randomized field experiment on a US apparel retailer’s website. We find that recommending a differently priced RP on the FP’s page reduces its purchase probability by 21 percent. The effect of price differences is more pronounced for closely related products, indicating that consumers are less likely to view and purchase differently priced RPs when they are closely related to the FP. Our estimates also reveal an asymmetric effect when the RP price is lower versus higher than the FP price. Since price differences between the FP and RP were not randomly assigned in our field experiment, we validate our results by exogenously varying the price differences of RPs on FPs’ pages in an online experiment on Amazon MTurk. The retailer could gain an additional four percent in total product sales by replacing differently priced recommendations with similarly priced ones, as per the causal forest. Our findings provide implications for online sales strategies and recommender system design.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a distributionally robust pricing model aimed at maximizing the worst-case profit under limited knowledge of consumers’ valuation distribution. In addition to mean and variance, we incorporate asymmetric distributional information through semivariance, and then explore the robust optimal posted and randomized pricing strategy. We obtain the robust posted price and show that several series of asymptotic three-point distributions can approach the worst case gradually. The inclusion of asymmetry enables sellers to design three distinct pricing strategies, each corresponding to a different level of asymmetry with explicitly defined thresholds. For the randomized pricing problem, we derive a near-optimal strategy by identifying three key pricing candidates. To avoid the complexity of implementing the optimal randomized price, we also explore a compromise strategy that employs a finite set of pricing candidates, which we formulate as a second-order cone program. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence highlighting the advantages of incorporating asymmetric distributional information over the mean-variance approach, from both the worst-case profit and actual profit perspectives. Our numerical experiments also reveal that posted pricing is more effective for low-cost products, while randomized pricing is preferable for higher-cost items.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Distributionally Robust Dynamic Resource Provisioning under Service Level Agreement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a dynamic resource provisioning problem for a supplier in which the availability of the provisioned resource is subject to random disruptions whose distribution is only indirectly observable through samples. To signal its commitment to service quality, the supplier adopts a service level agreement contract that specifies both the target service level and the associated penalty for violation over a finite contract period. The supplier needs to dynamically determine resource provisioning decisions with the objective of minimizing operational costs and penalties incurred due to service level agreement violations. We construct a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust dynamic programming framework to model and solve the dynamic resource provisioning problem under a service level agreement. In particular, we provide a convexification algorithm that enables us to solve the nonconvex robust dynamic programming problem in a backward manner. We further examine a special case where service shortages depend linearly on the provisioned resources, enabling the problem to be reformulated into a sequence of linear programs. This linear shortage model naturally connects to residual-based robust formulations, which facilitate us to accommodate nonlinear relationships between resource provisioning and service shortages. We propose several approximation algorithms to improve computational efficiency. To mitigate the possibly over-conservativeness, we explore radius adjustment strategies based on sample size, state, stage, and cumulative cost information, which yield consistent out-of-sample performance. We perform a case study of a cloud computing example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach and elicit managerial insights. The results suggest that suppliers should provide fewer backup servers when cumulative downtime is low or when approaching the end of the planning horizon. The dynamic resource provisioning policy significantly reduces the total cost compared to the best static policy. Furthermore, applying appropriate radius adjustments can further enhance the out-of-sample performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Staffing and Treatment for Collaborative Care of Diabetes and Depression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;About 27% of patients with diabetes also suffer from depression, and the presence of co-morbid depression could increase the cost of care for diabetes by up to 100%. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that physical and mental health are more likely to improve for diabetes patients suffering from depression when regular treatment for depression is provided in a primary care setting (called Collaborative Care). However, Collaborative Care requires additional resource utilization costs and a separate reimbursement model. When managing Collaborative Care, clinics must balance patient health outcomes with the program’s financial sustainability. Important operational levers in Collaborative Care are allocating care managers’ time to patients based on their requirements and the care managers’ staffing level. This staffing and workload allocation influences the revenue, costs, and patient health outcomes. We present a novel Markov Dynamic Programming model that, unlike existing approaches, jointly optimizes both staffing levels and treatment policies for Collaborative Care programs and quantifies the costs and benefits of collaborative care. Mathematically, we model Collaborative Care management at the clinical level as an infinite-horizon Markov Dynamic Program. The objective is a weighted sum of total patient QALYs and the clinic profits. The model incorporates insurance payment, resource utilization costs, and disease progression of co-morbid diabetes and depression. We derive structural properties for the joint optimization of the staffing level and allocating care managers’ time to different patient categories. Using these structural properties, we develop a practical and easy-to-implement policy for staffing level and care managers’ time allocation that performs close to the optimal solution. We calibrate the model with data from a large academic medical center and show that our solutions can improve total QALYs and clinic profits compared to current practices. Our analysis also reveals key insights into payment models’ effects on Collaborative Care. Profit under the fixed-fee model responds non-monotonically to payment rate increases, highlighting complex financial dynamics. Fixed-fee models show a threshold behavior, with high-intensity treatments becoming optimal only above certain payment rates. This threshold varies based on the profit-QALY weight balance, and this threshold is lower under joint-optimization than treatment-only optimization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate economic immunity to the COVID-19 pandemic accorded by a sector’s exposure to AI. Using an event study design, we causally estimate the impact of AI industry exposure (AIIE) on shifts in economic activity following the first pandemic-induced lockdown in India. We use payments data from one of India’s largest payment gateways and find that a one-standard-deviation increase in AIIE arrests the post-pandemic decline in industry payments by a third. High AIIE of neighboring sectors further improves a sector’s economic resilience, emphasizing the importance of supply chain partners in technology adoption and change. Further analyses speak to the mechanisms underlying the documented impact of AI on economic activity. Notably, we present evidence suggesting that the observed effects of AI are distinct from those attributable to IT investments or digitization, that AI investments are associated with superior information capabilities prior to the pandemic that arguably enabled agility and responsiveness, and that AI-enabled adaptation occurs in a manner that complements labor rather than displacing it. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of the assessment of the business value of AI and management of disruptions associated with crises events.</content>

    <title>How a Rotten Apple May Spoil the Barrel: Corporate Fraud Detection via Dynamic Business Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate fraud detection is attracting renewed research interest in the era of Internet connectivity due to its increasing complexity, concealment, and long-term duration. Previous fraud detection methods have heavily relied on financial statements and demonstrated limited detection power. While network analysis has emerged as a promising technique, its full potential in corporate fraud detection remains largely untapped, thus missing out on the potential improvement of fraud detection power. Recognizing this significant research gap, we devise a novel framework named as NetDetect to jointly learn structural information and temporal changes in dynamic heterogeneous networks for effective and interpretable corporate fraud detection. NetDetect consists of two new modules—meta-path-based static network feature extraction (SNFE) and temporal network feature extraction (TemFE). We rigorously evaluate each module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art baselines using a unique dataset of Chinese listed companies with a 561K node network. Experiment results and a case study demonstrate that our framework can detect corporate fraud more accurately compared to baselines and offer good early-warning capability as well as results interpretability. Our research results have important implications for various stakeholders (e.g., auditors, investors, and regulators) to understand and contain corporate fraud risk. We also discuss contributions to the IS knowledge base with three design principles to guide the development of similar IT artifacts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the optimal boundary for open data in an economy where financial and real-sector participants access both open and private data. The distinctive features of open access and nonrivalrous usage of open data enable its dual roles as a public information source and innovation input but raise privacy concerns. Our model reveals a novel tradeoff: Although enhanced private data precision and data skills substitute for open data’s information source role, its ability to amplify innovation benefits (via improved investment efficiency) establishes a crucial complementary relationship. This induces a crowding-in effect on the optimal open data boundary under low uncertainty but a crowding-out effect under high uncertainty. The innovation role of open data further generates nonmonotonic effects, yielding complex nonlinear impacts on market and real efficiency. These findings highlight critical policy tradeoffs in balancing innovation, market efficiency, and privacy in the digital age.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Z.

    <title>Firms’ Response to Credit Supply: Evidence from Upsized Corporate Bond Offerings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms often respond to information about investor demand, learned when underwriters build the book to place corporate bonds, by “upsizing” the offering amount. We examine the factors that predict two measures of realized credit supply (oversubscription and yield tightening) and show that the unexpected component of credit supply can explain firms’ upsizing decisions. Because firms’ fundamentals and need for capital are unchanged in the few hours of bookbuilding, upsizing provides a bond-level measure that can be used to study the impact of credit supply on postissuance leverage and investment. Firms use the sizeable additional proceeds to reduce bank debt and increase cash holdings; net increases in leverage are temporary for riskier issuers. Our evidence does not support concerns of overinvestment in periods of accommodative credit markets.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00153 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although maximizing quantiles is intuitively appealing and has an axiomatic foundation, it is difficult to find the optimal portfolio strategy because of time inconsistency. Using an intrapersonal equilibrium approach and focusing on the class of time-varying affine strategies, we find that the only viable outcome is from the median maximization because for other quantiles, either the equilibrium does not exist or there is no investment in risky assets. We also prove that maximizing the median endogenizes the use of portfolio insurance. The calibration of the model uncovers a new empirical phenomenon: “portfolio share smile.”This paper was accepted by Giesecke Kay, finance.Funding: This research was supported by the General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR [Grant 14207620], Early Career Scheme of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR [Grant 25213424], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 12401622], and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [Grant P0042708].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03182 .</content>

    <title>When Do Individuals Believe in Themselves Rather Than in Artificial Intelligence? Insights from Longitudinal Investigations in Corporate Credit‐Rating Contexts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals often prioritize their own judgements rather than heeding the advice of artificial intelligence (AI). This study draws on the literature on anchoring theory and cognitive biases to explore the theoretical mechanisms underlying individuals’ reliance on AI advice and how this reliance affects decision performance. Specifically, we examined situations in which (1) individuals’ knowledge accumulated over time, (2) multiple information sources were available, and (3) AI could emulate users’ decisions. We developed a ‘corporate credit‐rating’ AI system that could provide more accurate advice than users. We then conducted two main longitudinal studies and four supplementary ones – six in total – with each study comprising three sessions. Our findings demonstrated that individuals’ initial estimates became more similar to AI advice over time. As the difference between individuals’ initial estimates and AI advice increased, individuals were more inclined to revise their initial judgements but showed lower relative dependence on AI. This effect, however, depended on the individuals’ experience in decision‐making. Additionally, introducing additional information reduced the similarity between the initial estimate and AI advice, but the proximity of additional information to AI advice facilitated individuals’ adjustment to the advice. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results.</content>

    <title>Beyond the front page: In‐text citations to patents as traces of inventor knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces in‐text patent‐to‐patent citations—references embedded in the body of patent documents—as a novel data source to trace knowledge flows. Unlike front‐page citations, which often reflect legal requirements, in‐text citations are more likely to originate from inventors and signal meaningful technological linkages. We show that they exhibit stronger geographic and semantic proximity, greater self‐referentiality, and closer alignment with inventor knowledge. Though less frequent than front‐page citations, they yield robust results in models of knowledge diffusion. We release a validated dataset and reproducible code to support future research. Our findings offer new opportunities for scholars interested in the microfoundations of innovation, the geography of knowledge flows, and the role of inventors in shaping firms' knowledge trajectories.Managerial SummaryThis study introduces in‐text patent citations—references embedded in the technical description of patent documents—as a new way to trace how knowledge flows among inventors and firms. Unlike traditional front‐page citations, which often reflect legal formalities or examiner input, in‐text citations originate more directly from inventors and thus capture genuine technological linkages. Using large‐scale U.S. patent data, we show that in‐text citations connect geographically and thematically closer inventions and are more likely to involve the same firms or inventors. The dataset, released as open data, enables more accurate analyses of innovation dynamics and firm knowledge strategies. Managers can use these insights to better understand how ideas diffuse and where valuable inventive knowledge resides.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a significant yet underappreciated effect of IPR implementation: the dissemination after TRIPS implementation of established scientific knowledge from low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) into the global scientific system of pharmaceutical development. The staggered implementation of the policy allows identification of increased diffusion of pre‐existing LMIC knowledge on global diseases into the global corporate invention pipeline. For neglected diseases, the uptake remains in academic science. Other results demonstrate institutional effects in the scientific communities in LMICs through increases in scientific productivity, cross‐border collaborations, and scientist mobility. These and other results recast TRIPS’ impact as sensitive to the incentives of global corporations and institutionally significant for LMICs. We discuss implications for research on innovation strategy.Managerial SummaryThe implementation in an LMIC of an intellectual‐property system (e.g., of patents) carries implications for dissemination of pre‐existing scientific knowledge from the implementing country into the global scientific system. Corporate invention more intensively incorporates pre‐existing LMIC knowledge when the subject is global diseases such as cardiovascular conditions and cancer. However, when the subject is neglected diseases such as infectious conditions, the significant uptake remains in academic science. Overall, this research suggests that the implementation of patent and other intellectual‐property protections influences the integration of LMIC science into the global system differentially based on the relevance for global commercialization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research has revealed that return spreads between stocks with high and low characteristics-based factor beta remain insignificant. This study investigates the time variation in the pricing of various characteristics-based factors, uncovering a notable two-regime pattern: high-beta portfolios yield higher returns than low-beta portfolios after high-sentiment periods, while the opposite occurs after low-sentiment periods. Remarkably, this two-regime pattern is completely reversed for macro factors. Mutual fund and hedge fund returns corroborate these findings. Our results suggest that exposure to characteristics-based factors likely represents mispricing levels, particularly during high-sentiment periods, whereas exposure to macro factors likely represents risk, particularly during low-sentiment periods.</content>

    <title>A Selfless Integrator or a Selfish Quasi‐Professional? Relational Tactics for Organizational Professionals’ Durable Influence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study works towards a ‘sociology of organizational professionals’ by elucidating how they navigate domains dominated by occupational professionals. It shows that relational tactics impact whether organizational professionals remain limited to a periphery, become subservient to occupational professionals, or achieve durable roles. Drawing on qualitative data from 12 Italian hospitals, we analyse how quality managers enact relational strategies towards executives and senior clinicians in the context of integrated care. We identify four configurations of tactics with distinct role outcomes. Tactics focused only on executives (transparent knowledge sharing, subordinate activation) yield no role enhancement. Tactics directed only at occupational professionals (transparent knowledge sharing, rapid relational engagement) render quality managers subservient to occupational professionals. Tactics simultaneously aimed at executives and occupational professionals enhance the role in a durable way. Such tactics may follow a ‘selfless’ approach (rapid relationality, subordinate activation, transparent knowledge sharing), which enables quality managers to expand their role across domains, becoming itinerant integrators; or a ‘selfish’ quasi‐professional approach (rapid reciprocity, consultant activation, opaque knowledge sharing), which enables quality managers to enrich their role, becoming stable niche service providers. We offer new insights into how organizational professionals negotiate authority, influence, and mobility within established professional hierarchies through relational strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wearable devices hold significant promise for promoting healthy behaviors, yet they often fall short of this potential when users disengage or use them ineffectively. This research examines how individuals respond to negative incidents—such as frustrating feedback, misaligned goals, or perceived surveillance—and how these responses influence continued effective use. Effective use means interacting with the wearable in ways that help achieve health-related goals, beyond merely logging steps or checking data. Based on in-depth accounts from long-term users, the study reveals that, although some cope by re-engaging with the technology, others manipulate data, disengage, or selectively avoid features, undermining the benefits wearables are meant to deliver. Crucially, sustained effective use depends not just on motivation or usability but on the alignment between human and system agency. When wearables assert their own logic too strongly or misalign with user goals, maladaptive responses are more likely. These findings offer actionable guidance for designers, healthcare providers, and policymakers: Rather than focusing solely on adoption or persuasive design, efforts should support user autonomy and recovery after setbacks. Wearables that accommodate breakdowns and empower users in the face of friction are more likely to sustain engagement and improve long-term health outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship scholarship faces challenges related to diverse populations, striving to balance inclusivity with the recognition of unique entrepreneurial identities. Applying optimal distinctiveness theory, we explore the relationship between belongingness and uniqueness in entrepreneurship research. Catalyzed by Bakker and McMullen’s 2023 article on inclusivity in entrepreneurship, we utilized natural language processing to examine responses about inclusive entrepreneurship from 29 scholars dedicated to marginalized populations. Findings suggest that employing varied research methods and integrating structural and epistemological considerations can enhance our understanding of entrepreneurial heterogeneity. We advocate for entrepreneurship research that values individual experiences while promoting inclusive practices, highlighting the need for evolving scholarly paradigms to reflect entrepreneurial differences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on the strategic entrepreneurship perspective and upper echelon theory, we examine the importance of private equity (PE) functional human capital and socio-demographic diversity for the success of the acquisitive growth strategy. Our focus is on the buyout lead partner team rather than on human capital at the collective PE firm (or fund) level. The results of our panel data survival models suggest that gender and age diversity, as well as the financial background, significantly accelerate both first and subsequent add-on acquisitions. The results are robust to alternative proxies, model specifications, and endogeneity checks.JEL Codes:G24, G34, J10, L26</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New forms of shared micromobility services, such as electric scooters (i.e., e-scooters) are growing rapidly across cities. However, their impact beyond the retail and restaurant sectors is less understood in the marketing literature. We examine how the entry of e-scooters impacts other incumbent shared mobility services (i.e., ridesharing and bikesharing) and consumer safety (i.e., crimes) using data on the entry of e-scooters in parts of Chicago in 2019 and a generalized synthetic control approach. We propose and test novel mechanisms based on e-scooters’ effects on overall demand and modal relationships (i.e., complementarity vs. substitution) with ridesharing and bikesharing. The results from our analysis show that the entry of e-scooters increases the number of short rideshare trips by 15.72%, but decreases the number of bikeshare trips by 7.62%. The effects are consistent with acategory expansionmechanism for ridesharing (i.e., increase in the demand for trips met by complementarities between e-scooters and ridesharing) and acategory cannibalizationmechanism for bikesharing (i.e., increase in the demand for trips met by substitution of bikesharing by e-scooters). Interestingly, we also find that the entry of e-scooters increases the number of crimes (e.g., vehicle break-ins) by 17.94%, mostly due to street and vehicle crimes. The effects of e-scooters are heterogeneous by the age and racial composition of a neighborhood. Overall, e-scooters contribute about $8.1 million in ridesharing revenues but they also have an unintended negative environmental effect amounting to over 800 metric ton carbon emissions per year. Our research offers anapp companionfor stakeholders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For two decades, research on individual and organizational celebrity has flourished. However, the literature remains limited in several ways. First, despite recent gains regarding the antecedents of celebrity, current theory does not fully explain why celebrity resides at a specific locus (i.e., at the individual‐ and/or organizational level). Second, research has suggested that both the media and organizations play significant roles in celebrity attainment. However, researchers have focused more on the media’s role in creating celebrity narratives and less on the role that organizational communications play in the narrative process and how they affect the locus of celebrity. Lastly, research has provided a fragmented picture of individual and organizational celebrity, disregarding that organizations and their leaders can share high degrees of positive attention (i.e., have concurrent celebrity) that likely have different effects than celebrity located at only one locus. We address these issues by integrating celebrity research across multiple loci to develop a theory of the narrative antecedents of the locus of celebrity. In doing so, we explain how organizations can actively create individual, organizational, or concurrent celebrity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge-sharing communities face a dual challenge: they must enable efficient content generation and also provide spaces in which interpersonal bonds can form. We examine how these goals interact by studying Stack Overflow’s introduction of informal chat rooms alongside its main question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) forum. Using a difference-in-differences design, we analyze two sequential shocks: the launch of chat rooms and the later addition of automated feeds that pushed Q&amp;A content into chat rooms, thus creating a bridging mechanism between the two spaces. We find that, on their own, the introduction of chat rooms leads to no improvement in knowledge exchange for average users in the community. However, we find evidence that chat rooms may forge a closed subgroup of users, who tend to primarily help each other by answering questions within the group, and the benefits are isolated to the subgroup. The activation of an automated feeding function that pushes all questions into the chat room expands benefits beyond the closed subgroup. Our results show that platform designers should consider not only how to foster subgroup cohesion, but also how to facilitate bridging between interactions in the subgroups and the broader community.PRESS BLURBA new study of Stack Overflow shows that adding informal chat rooms can deepen engagement among certain members but risks creating exclusive circles. When paired with bridging tools, such as automated feeds that connect chat rooms and Q&amp;A forums, response times improved and benefits reached a wider set of users. The findings highlight how platform design choices can shape inclusivity, efficiency, and knowledge exchange in online communities.Social Media blurb:Study shows that pairing informal chat rooms with bridging tools such as feeds can enhance both engagement and inclusivity in online communities.Alternatives: 🧩 Chat rooms foster bonds; feeds build bridges: how design choices shape knowledge sharing in online communities. ⚡ Adding bridges such as feeds makes online communities faster, fairer, and more inclusive—lessons from Stack Overflow. 🌐 Efficient answers + human connection: why balancing chat rooms and bridging tools matters for knowledge platforms.</content>

    <title>How Can Firms Enhance Perceptions of Return‐to‐Office When Restricting Autonomy Over Where Work Occurs?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As return‐to‐office (RTO) policies grow in popularity, firms are struggling to quell resistance from employees—especially since RTO policies inherently restrict autonomy over where work occurs. Integrating HRM system strength and signaling theory with our critique that firms are often depicted as far more passive in the work‐life flexibility literature than they are in practice, we theorize a process of RTO conversion as to how firms address the recoil effect they create (i.e., employee resistance) when introducing RTO. We conceptualize employees' perceptions of RTO as a continuum ranging from “employer‐friendly” (low) to “employee‐friendly” (high) based on the extent to which firms consider and rectify how on‐site requirements misalign with employees' preferences for autonomy over where work occurs. Our work underscores the complexity of how RTO unfolds in practice, involving ongoing, dynamic efforts across multiple business functions to convert and sustain perceptions of RTO as employee‐friendly. A core theme throughout is that an emphasis on quality of work life—specifically, enhancing the physical and psychosocial features of the workplace to improve employees' extrinsic and intrinsic on‐site experiences—functions as a potentially viablesubstitutefor autonomy over where work occurs. We also discuss implications for CEOs, HR leaders, strategy, policies, and practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a new database of banking-crisis interventions, covering 1,946 interventions in 20 categories across 143 countries. We demonstrate that crisis-intervention patterns are significantly related to income and fiscal variables and to measures of the political system and currency regime. GDP losses following crises are economically significant and are larger for wealthier countries, with some evidence that these losses are mitigated by democratic political systems and liberal currency regimes. Finally, intervention frequencies reached an apex during the post–Bretton Woods era, continuing a secular increase since at least the late seventeenth century. (JEL G01, E60, N20)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm in cobotic order picking operations, we investigate the optimal information design to navigate human workers (HWs) who cooperate with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within an intralogistics system. We incorporate asymmetric information between AMRs and HWs in a routing game where connected AMRs are informed of the congestion state while HWs rely on information provided by the system. The system designs a communication policy aiming to navigate HWs away from congestion. Without strategic communications, we show that the deployment of AMRs cannot mitigate congestion unless the automation level reaches a threshold. Interestingly, we illustrate a substitution effect between automation and strategic communications when information distortion is mild. In contrast, severe information distortion complements automation due to exacerbated congestion. Furthermore, an in‐house AMR fleet is economically more efficient than a third‐party logistics service. Consequently, in‐house automation can be achieved with mild information distortion, while severe information distortion is required to complement the lack of efficiency in the third‐party AMR fleet. With simulated numerical examples to complement the analytical results, we provide managerial insights concerning the optimal information policies under different levels of automation, guiding warehouse managers in their communications with workers to achieve the best performance of the cobotic system.</content>

    <title>Analytics for IoT‐Enabled Human–Robot Hybrid Sortation: An Online Optimization Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by a realworld practice of a China Post sortation center, this study considers the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve the efficiency of a human–robot hybrid sortation system. In this system, IoT technology enables responsive adjustment of the manual capacity to alleviate the congestion effect of increasing parcel flow on robotic sorting efficiency. We begin with a predictive analysis of a real‐life dataset to quantify the congestion effect on robotic sorting efficiency, and examine the nonstationary behavior of the parcel flow process. Subsequently, we design an online algorithm using IoT advance information (which refers to advance observation of some parcel flows before their actual arrivals) for efficiently adjusting the manual capacity. We develop theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of the online algorithm by bounding its regret, and also demonstrate that the long‐term expected regret rate is zero under mild conditions. Via extensive simulation experiments, we find that our online algorithm outperforms the China Post sortation center's current policy and conventional Markov dynamic program in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality. The simulation results also demonstrate that the value of IoT technology to the sortation center can be significant, and shed insights on IoT investment by revealing the diminishing return of expanding the horizon of IoT advance information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the burgeoning trend of prosumers, who have transformed from traditional consumers into active renewable energy producers. While prosumers help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, they often remain connected to the grid as a backup. This practice requires that utility companies reserve capacity, and conventional consumers share these associated costs. We develop a stylized model to comprehensively assess the impact of prosumers. Our findings demonstrate that, although prosumers contribute to diminishing non-renewable energy consumption and offer potential cost savings to utility firms, they simultaneously introduce negative externalities. Specifically, they inject uncertainty into the grid, resulting in higher electricity prices and increased utility bills for regular consumers, even when fixed costs incurred by utility firms are not considered. As the intermittency of prosumer energy generation increases, the socially optimal proportion decreases while the self-selected equilibrium proportion of prosumers increases. Furthermore, we examine the potential implications of a conventional linear incentive scheme for prosumers, exemplified by the 2023 U.S. federal tax credit for solar panel installation costs. We find that such schemes may exacerbate social disparity. To address this issue, we propose a reverse-linear subsidization approach, which paradoxically requires less funding to achieve equivalent prosumer adoption rates and results in smaller social disparity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rapid growth of omnichannel retailing and the takeaway delivery economy, the classic point-to-point mode for on-demand delivery is deficient in delivery capacity, coverage area, dispatching efficiency, and courier safety assurance. Inspired by the success of Dabbawala, a historical Indian company for lunch delivery, we propose a novelpublic on-demand delivery service systemthat uses the public transit network to satisfy stochastic delivery demands. In particular, the proposed system includes a radial public transit network for intermediate transshipment, as well as couriers with e-bikes for terminal pick-up and drop-off. Our research aims to generate system design that minimizes the sum of penalty costs from lost sales and operational costs associated with courier terminal delivery distance. Solving the integrated system optimization problem relies on incorporating operational details, especially the allocation strategies of the lines’ capacity and the couriers’ terminal traveling modes. For the former, we propose a novel flexible design, called dual long-chain design, to improve flexibility. For the latter, we propose an elegant approximation of optimal service region partitioning that minimizes the expected terminal delivery distance and the resulting costs, without compromising delivery timeliness. Leveraging the theoretical results of the operational strategies, we simplify the integrated optimization problem and propose an efficient approximation algorithm. Finally, we validate the advantage of the proposed system over classic point-to-point delivery in satisfying demands and reducing costs through extensive numerical experiments, providing managerial insights in handling massive on-demand delivery demands and utilizing the idle capacity of the public transit system.</content>

    <title>Velocity‐Based Stowage Policy for a Semiautomated Fulfillment System</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online retail fulfillment is increasingly performed by semiautomated fulfillment systems in which inventory is stored in mobile pods that are moved by robotic drives. In this paper, we develop a model that explores the benefits of velocity‐based stowage policies for semiautomated fulfillment systems, also known as robotic mobile fulfillment systems. The stowage policies decide which pods to replenish with the received inventory. Specifically, we model policies that account for the velocity of the units being stowed. By stowing higher (lower) velocity units on higher (lower) velocity pods, we expect to increase the heterogeneity of the pod velocities. Greater heterogeneity in pod velocities can yield a greater reduction in pod travel distance from velocity‐based storage policies for the pod. Reducing pod travel distance decreases the number of robotic drives that are needed for the system to maintain a certain throughput rate. We analyze anM‐class velocity‐based stowage policy. We stow units from each velocity class onto pods dedicated to that velocity class; each class of pods then has its own storage zone, where the zones are ordered based on the distance to the stationary pick and stow stations. We characterize the pod travel distance as a function of the skewness of the demand distribution and the number and size of the classes. We find that with two or three classes we can achieve most of the benefits possible from a velocity‐based stowage and storage policy. For representative demand distributions, we find that a two‐class policy achieves 75% of the maximum possible travel‐time reduction and that a three‐class policy improves this to 90%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a controlled experiment to show that ability and belief calibration jointly determine the benefits of working with artificial intelligence (AI). AI improves performance more for people with low baseline ability. However, holding ability constant, AI assistance is more valuable for people who are calibrated, meaning they have accurate beliefs about their own ability. People who know they have low ability gain the most from working with AI. In a counterfactual analysis, we show that eliminating miscalibration would cause AI to reduce performance inequality nearly twice as much as it already does.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Alfred P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper experimentally demonstrates that group discussions can serve as an instrument to improve competence calibration, which in turn allows getting more wisdom out of the crowd through competence weighting. While the alignment of individuals’ estimation accuracy and self-perceived competence is typically poor and competence-weighted aggregates do not even match the accuracy of simple averaging, we find that preceding group discussions on unrelated judgment problems enhance competence calibration. Consequently, the subsequent performance of competence-weighted aggregation schemes rises to and beyond prediction market levels, suggesting an easy-to-implement approach for effectively exploiting crowd wisdom.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03061 .</content>

Consumers often purchase products, subscribe to services, and download apps in support of valued goals, yet fail to use these tools as much as intended. But might the language consumers use to describe such goal failures affect how they subsequently pursue those goals? Nine experiments demonstrate that, compared to saying “didn’thavetime”, saying “didn’tmaketime” increases subsequent motivation. This is driven by perceived control over time. Specifically, saying “didn’t make” (vs. “didn’t have”) time makes consumers feel more in control of their time, which increases their subsequent motivation to reengage with the goal. Notably, such make-time framing has downstream implications for consumer evaluations of goal-related products and services. Further, it can be manipulated directly, as well as through firms’ promotional activities (i.e., featuring make-time language on social media). Importantly, make-time (vs. have-time) framing may be particularly beneficial in the context of goal failure, when consumers are less inclined to adopt this perspective naturally. Together, the findings shed light on how language shapes motivation, deepen understanding of time’s role in goal pursuit, and have important implications for how companies manage consumer goal failure.</content>

    <title>Legitimation Through Stakeholder Endorsements: How Political Affinity Shapes Foreign

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research suggests that political affinity between home and host countries can influence the strategic decisions and outcomes of multinational corporations by conferring legitimacy, it often implicitly assumes that this legitimacy transfer occurs automatically. This assumption overlooks the complexity of organizational legitimation. We address this gap by exploring the specific pathways through which political affinity translates into the legitimacy of foreign initial public offering (IPO) firms, a context where overcoming the capital market liability of foreignness is critical. Drawing on the legitimacy perspective, we develop a model that explainshowandwhenpolitical affinity influences the legitimacy and survival of foreign IPO firms in the host‐country stock market. Specifically, we theorize and test a moderated mediation model that demonstrates: (1) the legitimation mechanism (how): political affinity enhances the legitimacy of foreign IPO firms through endorsements by local analysts and alliance partners, thereby reducing their delisting risk and (2) the boundary condition (when): this pathway is more pronounced for firms with stronger external stakeholder orientation. Empirical analyses using a sample of foreign IPO firms in the United States provide general support for our theoretical predictions. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on political affinity and foreign IPO firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bruton et al.’sPointarticle argues that management and organizational scholarship (MOS) pays insufficient attention to context, using entrepreneurship research as their main case. We agree with their call to put institutions and policies at the forefront of MOS scholarship but disagree with their proposed approach and see many weaknesses in their reasoning. But, in thisCounterpoint, we argue that thePointarticle (1) imputes a questionable ‘capitalist’ bias to entrepreneurship research, (2) relies on notions of socialism and capitalism that do not advance entrepreneurship as a discipline, (3) oversimplifies or neglects the variety of real‐world institutional arrangements, (4) misses a large literature on institutions (in MOS and increasingly also in entrepreneurship research), and (5) fails to supply a positive agenda for entrepreneurship research. More generally, we question their interpretation and application of socialism – normally understood as a country‐ or society‐level construct – to organizations and argue that organizational and institutional scholarship already addresses their phenomena of interest. OurCounterpointends with a proposal to advance MOS and entrepreneurship scholarship by focusing on the different forms and outcomes of organizations and entrepreneurship across countries and institutional environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Upfront payments are important financial resources startups seek to negotiate in technology alliances. This study unpacks how venture‐backed startups can benefit from their VC affiliations and obtain better payments. We develop a bargaining framework and argue that VCs can strengthen venture‐backed startups' hand in alliance negotiations through two distinct pathways: (i) by providing a quality signal, and (ii) by serving as conduits of alternative partnering options. We further suggest that these distinct benefits in bargaining hinge on startups' technological quality, which substitutes for the quality signal arising from VC affiliations but complements the VC's intermediation role in markets for partners. The evidence therefore identifies the distinct and complex channels by which VCs can help startups obtain financial resources at nascent stages through their technology alliances.Managerial SummaryUpfront payments in technology alliances are vital revenues for technology startups. This study reveals how venture capital (VC) affiliations strengthen startups' bargaining position and enable them to secure larger payments. VCs add value in startups' alliance negotiations in two key ways: by signaling the quality of the startup's resources and by providing alternative partnering options. The benefits of these mechanisms vary with the startup's technological quality—strong technology can substitute for the VC's quality signal but enhances the value of VC intermediation. Managers should recognize that VCs add value to their ventures beyond financing by also reinforcing their investee startups' bargaining power, helping startups negotiate favorable terms in technology alliances.</content>

    <title>Categorical Atypicality and Evaluation Accuracy: Who Make More Accurate Evaluations of Atypical Firms?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature on market categories and identities focuses primarily on whether categorical atypicality leads to positive or negative evaluation; however, much less is known about whether the evaluation is accurate or not. While it is important forproducersto know if atypicality is penalized or rewarded,audiencesare also concerned about whether their evaluation of atypical organizations is accurate, as well as how the evaluation can be improved. To shed light on this, we first test the association between categorical atypicality and evaluation accuracy. Distinguishing audiences in two dimensions – coverage coherence and typicality – we further theorize and examine which audiences are better able to evaluate atypical organizations. Analysing earnings forecasts for US firms, we find that analysts’ forecasts for atypical firms are not necessarily inaccurate, contrary to what prior theory would suggest. More importantly, the results show that analysts are more accurate in forecasting atypical firms when their coverages are more atypical and/or incoherent. The findings suggest that atypical and incoherent coverage enables analysts to better understand atypical firms, supporting our core conjecture of ‘unconventional audiences for atypical actors’.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study an intervention by a brokerage firm providing advisory services to high-net-worth investors. In 2018, the firm changed the information displayed on its internal platform, so that financial advisors could no longer observe which clients’ holdings were in paper gain or loss. Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, that is, a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows financial firms can successfully reduce clients’ biases by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new measure of technological obsolescence using detailed patent data. The measure contains incremental information about firm innovation relative to measures focusing on new innovation. Using this measure, we present two sets of results. First, firms’ technological obsolescence foreshadows substantially lower growth, productivity, and reallocation of capital. This finding mainly applies to obsolescence of core innovation and embodied innovation, and it is stronger in competitive product markets. Second, in stock markets, high-obsolescence firms underperform low-obsolescence firms by 7% annually. Using analyst forecast data, we show this is due to a systematic overestimation of future profits of obsolescent firms. (JEL O3, O4, G1, G3)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have witnessed significant growth in corporate sustainability reporting. Yet existing research provides mixed evidence on the information content of these reports for investors. We examine the stock market reaction to the announcement of a sample of US corporate sustainability reports incorporating Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics that are intended to provide financially material information to investors. Using standard measures of information content, we cannot find compelling evidence that these reports provide a significant amount of new information to investors. Further analysis of a subset of common metrics indicates that they are either financially immaterial or preempted by traditional financial disclosures. Finally, we show that most firms target their sustainability reports at a broad set of sustainability-oriented stakeholders rather than a narrow set of financially oriented investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether narrative discussion in financial disclosures can help corporate stakeholders better predict tax outcomes. To measure qualitative discussion, we use topic modeling analysis to create measures of the thematic content of 10-K disclosures. We find that qualitative discussion in financial disclosures can substantially improve prediction of tax outcomes in in- and out-of-sample tests. We also find that prediction-relevant discussion is distributed throughout the 10-K, supporting that disclosures should be analyzed holistically rather than examining only limited pieces of larger disclosures. Further, we find that analysts often do not use this information effectively, resulting in predictable and economically meaningful forecast errors. These findings illustrate the wealth of qualitative information in 10-K disclosures for stakeholders concerned about tax outcomes and offer a practical approach to examining qualitative disclosures and using them to predict tax outcomes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Redesigning Harvesting Processes and Improving Working Conditions in Agribusiness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We collaborate with a leading mushroom producer in North America to investigate the potential benefits of redesigning agribusiness operations, specifically, harvesting processes, to enhance both firm performance and working conditions of employees. We consider two harvesting protocols: the dominant status-quo practice, namely Harvest-all and an alternative, namely Selective Harvesting. In the Harvest-all protocol, workers pick all crop units in the areas assigned to them, regardless of the crops’ size and maturity, resulting in higher productivity but lower average value (quality) of the harvested produce. Workers also remain in demanding physical postures for longer periods of time, resulting in ergonomic stress. In contrast, under the Selective Harvesting protocol, workers take multiple rounds to completely harvest the assigned area, picking in each round only the select crop units that are near their peak monetary value. This results in lower productivity but higher average quality of the harvested produce and better ergonomic conditions. We develop mathematical models to analyze the two harvesting protocols, provide a complete analytical characterization of the optimal managerial decisions under each protocol, and examine how these decisions are influenced by relevant contextual factors. In addition, we characterize the performance of each harvesting protocol along three key performance metrics of interest: firm profitability, worker monetary welfare, and worker ergonomic welfare. Using both analytical and calibrated numerical methods we show that adopting Selective Harvesting over Harvest-all can create win-win scenarios where both the firm and workers are better off. However, our analysis reveals that the firm’s and workers’ interests may not always be fully aligned. We subsequently demonstrate that the misalignment can be reduced by making adjustments to the compensation structure so that workers’ earnings match the maximum potential value while having minimal impact on firm profitability. Our models illustrate the benefits of careful process redesign in creating better working conditions for employees and advancing firms’ social responsibility practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The prophet inequality is a cornerstone of online decision making, comparing a sequential decision maker to a prophet who knows all outcomes in advance. In “Trading Prophets,” J. Correa, A. Cristi, P. Dütting, M. Hajiaghayi, J. Olkowski, and K. Schewior initiate the study of buy-and-sell prophet inequalities. Here, an online algorithm observes a sequence of prices, one after the other, to trade an item. At each time step, the algorithm can decide to buy and pay the current price if it does not already hold the item, or it can decide to sell and collect the current price as a reward if it holds the item. The authors identify settings where a constant-factor approximation to the all-knowing prophet benchmark can be achieved. Interestingly, these conditions differ from those required for standard prophet inequalities. Specifically, they show that no constant-factor inequality exists for arbitrary independent prices. In contrast, they prove that a constant factor is achievable when independent prices arrive in a random order.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Supervision Lifts Rural Weavers’ ProductivityFrequent, predictable supervisor visits can be a powerful lever for boosting artisan productivity in distributed supply chains, according to a study conducted with Jaipur Rugs in India. Analyzing loom-level data, the authors show that reducing the average gap between visits by just one day raises weaving rates by 8.5%—with more substantial gains on complex rugs and when visits follow consistent schedules. Building on these insights, they develop a routing and scheduling framework that targets those looms most in need of support. In a 25-week field implementation covering about 6,000 visits across 200 looms, sites assigned to optimized routes saw a 16.7% increase in weaving speed relative to controls, highlighting a practical, low-cost pathway to higher earnings for rural women weavers. The research suggests that data-driven supervision in other supply chains with a similar structure (e.g., smallholder agriculture) could boost productivity and earnings, offering an operational lever for poverty alleviation at scale.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the empirical evidence observed from the real-world data set, this paper studies context-based dynamic pricing with separable demand models. Consider a seller selling a product over a finite horizon of T periods and facing an unknown expected demand function that admits a separable structure [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] denote the product’s price and features, respectively. The seller does not know the exact expression of [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] but can dynamically adjust prices in each period based on the observed features and demands to learn their forms. The seller’s objective is to maximize the T-period expected revenue. We systematically characterize the statistical complexity of the online learning problem under three configurations of demand models with different structures of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. For each model, we design an efficient online learning algorithm with a provable regret upper bound. We also show that the upper bound is generally unimprovable by proving a matching regret lower bound in certain parameter regimes. Our results reveal fundamental differences in the optimal regret rates when [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are endowed with different structures. The numerical results demonstrate that our learning algorithms are more effective than benchmark algorithms for all the three models and also show the effects of the parameters associated with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] on the algorithm’s empirical regret.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>The Authenticity of Purpose Claims: Firm Capacity and Job Seeker Responses to Recruitment Efforts</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whereas corporate purpose involves a claim made to galvanize stakeholders, recent research on the topic has not examined it as a claim. Given the information asymmetry that many evaluators of purpose claims face, a key question concerns the conditions under which they are not simply viewed as cheap talk but are instead perceived as authentic. We argue that the difficulty and future orientation inherent to purpose claims make firm capacity a key source of authenticity and, ultimately, positive evaluations. We examine these ideas in the labor market context, where employers often present purpose claims to job seekers facing information asymmetry. First, we develop and validate a novel measure of purpose claim strength using a combination of topic modeling, dictionary-based validation, and experimental validation. Using this measure, we test our capacity hypothesis with job application field data, using firm size as a proxy for capacity. We find that high-purpose job posts receive approximately 50% more applications than low-purpose job posts when the firm has more than 1,000 employees, but only receive about a 10% increase when the firm has fewer than 50 employees. In a second study, we use vignette experiments to directly test our hypothesized mechanism. We show that, conditional on a strong purpose claim, size manipulations shape capacity perceptions, leading to greater perceived authenticity and increased application likelihood. Next, holding size constant, we show that an affiliation-based manipulation leads to similar results. Our paper helps scholars understand what gives authenticity to purpose claims and helps practitioners understand how they can more effectively communicate purpose.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Funding: This research was supported by funding from the Center for Sustainable Business at the University of Pittsburgh School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03931 .</content>

    <title>Reputation on the Line: How the Third-Party Dilemma Shapes Trust in High-Risk Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite scholars’ increasing acknowledgment of the role third parties can play in others’ trust decisions, we know very little about what motivates these parties’ information sharing. Our research examines this process via a qualitative, inductive study of linemen: the men and women who work on power lines. We show how features of their work context give rise to a strong reliance on third-party information for trust and strong accountability for third parties who share reputational information. These conditions cultivate what we call the “third-party dilemma”: Linemen feel trapped between desires to keep trustors safe and desires to protect their own reputations. We further explain how the information-sharing practices by which they manage this dilemma ultimately affect the trust triad by allowing third parties to partially safeguard their reputations, encouraging trustors to provisionally grant or withhold trust, and subjecting trustees to either sticky negative reputations or fragile positive reputations. These dynamics encourage lower trust within the triad. We conclude by highlighting the importance of the work context in shaping third-party motives, discussing the trust-related implications of how the third-party dilemma is managed, and redirecting trust research beyond dyadic (trustor–trustee) models of trust.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present new facts on how convenience yields fluctuate with macroeconomic variables and fiscal policy: the convenience yield of long-term Treasuries is negatively correlated with inflation expectations, and inflation expectations predict future debt-to-GDP growth. To rationalize these findings, we incorporate the convenience yield into a macro-finance model with endogenous fiscal policy. The government finances deficit shocks partially through higher inflation and partially through more future borrowing, which reduces the convenience yield today. The feedback loop between the convenience yield and future debt supply amplifies the effect of fiscal shocks. We further verify this channel using empirically constructed exogenous deficit shocks.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-dated inflation swap contracts provide widely used estimates of expected inflation. We develop methods to estimate complementary tail probabilities for persistently very high or low inflation using inflation options prices. We show that three new adjustments to conventional methods are crucial: inflation, horizon, and risk. We find that: (a) U.S. deflation risk in 2011–2014 has been overstated, (b) ECB unconventional policies lowered deflation disaster probabilities, (c) inflation expectations deanchored in 2021–2022, (d) reanchored as policy tightened, (e) but the 2021–2024 disaster left scars, and (f) U.S. expectations are less sensitive to inflation realizations than in the eurozone.

    <title>Integrated Conditional Estimation-Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many real-world optimization problems involve uncertain parameters with probability distributions that can be estimated using contextual feature information. In contrast to the standard approach of first estimating the distribution of uncertain parameters and then optimizing the objective based on the estimation, we propose an integrated conditional estimation-optimization (ICEO) framework that estimates the underlying conditional distribution of the random parameter while considering the structure of the optimization problem. We directly model the relationship between the conditional distribution of the random parameter and the contextual features and then estimate the probabilistic model with an objective that aligns with the downstream optimization problem. We show that our ICEO approach is asymptotically consistent under moderate regularity conditions and further provide finite performance guarantees. Computationally, performing estimation with the ICEO approach is a nonconvex and often nondifferentiable optimization problem. We propose a general methodology for approximating the potentially nondifferentiable mapping from estimated conditional distribution to the optimal decision by a differentiable function, which greatly improves the performance of gradient-based algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate the empirical success of our approach in different situations, including with limited data samples and model mismatches.</content>

    <title>Bad-Drug Ads or Killer Ads: The Effects of Drug Injury Advertising on Public Health</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the impact of lawsuit advertisements targeting drug companies. Although the main purpose of the ads is to recruit potential lawsuit plaintiffs, they also reach a broad audience of viewers. Medical professionals have raised concerns that drug injury ads may lead uninjured patients to misperceive the risks and benefits of treatment, leading them to discontinue medically necessary drugs. The paper examines how drug injury ads affect prescription fills and subsequent health outcomes. The empirical context analyzes anticoagulants, which are commonly used by elderly patients to prevent strokes. The study finds that drug injury ads lead to a decrease in filled prescriptions for targeted drugs and a corresponding increase in hospitalizations for conditions treated with anticoagulants. These results point to meaningful public health consequences and highlight the benefits from policy responses that promote accurate and balanced information.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: Financial support for this research was generously provided through the National Science Foundation [Grant SES-1919040] and the Morrison Center for Marketing and Data Analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04294 .</content>

    <title>Care for the Mind amid Chronic Diseases: An Interpretable AI Approach Using IoT</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health sensing for chronic disease management creates immense benefits for social welfare. Existing health sensing studies primarily focus on the prediction of physical chronic diseases. Depression, a widespread complication of chronic diseases is, however, understudied. We draw on the medical literature to support depression detection using motion sensor data. To connect humans in this decision making, safeguard trust, and ensure algorithm transparency, we develop an interpretable deep learning model: temporal prototype network (TempPNet). TempPNet is built on the emergent prototype learning models. To accommodate the temporal characteristic of sensor data and the progressive property of depression, TempPNet differs from existing prototype learning models in its capability of capturing temporal progressions of prototypes. Extensive empirical analyses using real-world motion sensor data show that TempPNet outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in depression detection. Moreover, TempPNet interprets its decision by visualizing the temporal progression of depression and its corresponding symptoms detected from sensor data. We further employ a user study and a medical expert panel to demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study offers an algorithmic solution for impactful social good—collaborative care of chronic diseases and depression in health sensing. Methodologically, it contributes to extant literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for depression detection from sensor data. Patients, doctors, and caregivers can deploy our model on mobile devices to monitor patients’ depression risks in real time. Our model’s interpretability also allows human experts to participate in the decision making by reviewing the interpretation and making informed interventions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Behind the Curtain of Workforce Diversity: Evidence from EEO-1 Reports</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the 2023 court-ordered Freedom of Information Act release of standardized Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) reports to examine the workforce diversity of federal contractors. Using the released data for a sample of more than 19,000 publicly traded and private firms, we provide descriptive evidence on the variation in gender and racial diversity of these companies’ workforce. We also document the existence of a racial gap between managers and lower-level employees. A substantial portion of that gap cannot be explained by industry or geographic factors, reflecting the influence of firm-level characteristics. Then, focusing on a sample of more than 800 publicly traded federal contractors, we find robust evidence that the racial managerial gap is associated with firms’ decision to withhold the voluntary disclosure of their EEO-1 forms. Although our findings are subject to several caveats, we provide important evidence on workforce diversity and highlight the importance of using granular, firm-level data to study diversity topics.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07432 .</content>

    <title>Effects of Financial Constraints on Supply Chain Financing Choices and Operational Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bank credit access allows firms to borrow funds from banks and other financial institutions. Although theories have been developed on how bank financing affects firms’ operational decisions, empirical investigations in operations management (OM) literature remain limited. This study examines firms’ inventory management strategies in response to the enhanced credit lines from the adoption of interstate bank branching laws, which introduced staggered access to bank credit for operational firms. By merging multiple datasets with credit line information from 10-K SEC filings, we constructed a panel data set covering 1990–2005. Utilizing a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we find that improved bank credit access leads to a 6% faster inventory turnover, rather than an increase in inventory investment. This outcome appears to stem from short-term increases in capacity investments leveraging their enhanced bank credit and increased use of trade credit, alongside long-term improvements in infrastructure and capital intensity. While these developments are more pronounced for small firms in concentrated markets, their advantage translates into increased competition, negatively impacting the market position and profitability of larger firms. Additionally, in a broader supply chain context, focal firms experience faster inventory turnover when their major customers access more bank credit. The effect is especially prominent for large suppliers in competitive markets, driven by increased sales volumes. This research enhances understanding of the extensive impact of bank credit on operational management and offers insights for policymakers about the diverse effects of bank regulations across different market players and sectors.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for AI integration in research, particularly for data annotation and text classification. However, researchers lack guidance on implementation best practices, as the benefits and risks of these tools remain poorly understood. We develop a foundational framework for effective LLM implementation in management research, providing structured guidance on key decisions throughout the research process. We illustrate this framework through an empirical application: classifying sustainability claims in crowdfunding projects. While LLMs can match or exceed traditional methods' performance at lower cost, we find that variations in prompt design can significantly affect results and downstream analyses. We develop procedures for sensitivity analysis and provide detailed documentation to help researchers implement robustness while maintaining methodological integrity.Managerial SummaryLarge language models (LLMs) offer powerful new tools for business research, especially for analyzing and categorizing text data. However, managers and researchers lack clear guidance on how to use these tools effectively and reliably. This study creates a practical framework for implementing LLMs in management research, covering key decisions from model selection to result validation. Using a real‐world example of analyzing sustainability claims in crowdfunding campaigns, we demonstrate that LLMs can match traditional methods while being faster and cheaper. However, small changes in how you instruct the AI can significantly alter results and business conclusions. We provide systematic procedures for testing result reliability and offer practical tools to help managers implement AI‐powered analysis while maintaining rigorous standards and avoiding misleading findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer choices are constrained in many markets due to either supply-side rationing or information frictions. Examples include matching markets for schools and colleges; entry-level labor markets; limited brand awareness and inattention in consumer markets; and selective admissions to healthcare services. We analyze a general random utility model for consumer preferences that allows for endogenous characteristics and a reduced-form choice-set formation rule that can be derived from models of the examples described above. We show non-parametric identification of this model, propose an estimator, and apply these methods to study admissions in the market for kidney dialysis in California. Our identification results require two sets of instruments, one that only affects consumer preferences and the other that only affects choice sets. We show that both instruments are necessary for identification. These results also suggest tests of choice-set constraints, which we apply to the dialysis market. We find that dialysis facilities are less likely to admit new patients when they have a higher-than-normal caseload and that patients are more likely to travel further when nearby facilities have high caseloads. Finally, we estimate consumers’ preferences and facilities’ rationing rules using a Gibbs sampler.</content>

    <title>When a Star Shines Too Bright: The Impact of a High-Status Minority Member on Pursuing Diversity Goals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The current research examines a potential implication of having a high-status minority member in organizations—a “star” athlete, professor, or lawyer. Building on the literature on organizational diversity, individual status, and licensing effects, we suggest that having a minority member with high status can license organizational decision makers to reduce their effort in increasing diversity compared with having a minority member with relatively low status. We analyzed the hiring outcomes of Major League Baseball teams from 1988 to 2019 and found that the teams with a higher-status minority player hired fewer minority players in the next draft compared with the teams with a lower-status minority player. This effect was moderated by role prototypicality and group membership—the attributes that would further increase the saliency of a high-status minority player. We then corroborated these findings in a laboratory experiment showing that participants were less willing to invest effort in hiring minority candidates when a company already had a high-status (versus low-status) minority member. These findings extend existing literature by demonstrating when and how the presence of a prominent minority member might inadvertently diminish organizational efforts to increase diversity.Funding: The studies were funded by New York University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15155 .</content>

    <title>Race, Sexual Orientation, and Intersectionality in Distributive Negotiation Outcomes for Men</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Negotiations have consequences for people’s career trajectories, wealth, and well-being. Yet we still have a limited understanding of how demographic characteristics such as sexual orientation and race influence distributive negotiation outcomes, much less the intersection of multiple marginalized identities. To contribute to (1) our understanding of how identity influences negotiations and (2) research on intersectionality, we test how race (Black versus East Asian versus White) and sexual orientation (gay versus straight) influence distributive negotiation outcomes for men in a field experiment. We conducted a large-scale (n = 3,000), preregistered audit experiment involving (fictitious) buyers negotiating for cars on Craigslist. Sellers were 7.7 percentage points (22.4%) less likely to respond to gay versus straight White men. Sellers were also less polite in responses to Black and East Asian men (of any sexual orientation) than to straight White men. In a preregistered follow-up experiment (n = 500), we show that impoliteness in negotiation responses reduces positive expectations about negotiations and behavioral intentions to negotiate in the future, suggesting that differences in politeness may have consequences for racial minorities’ willingness to initiate future negotiations. Our work illuminates how identity-based biases manifest in negotiations, offers insights into theories of intersectionality, and underscores how demand-side biases can lead to supply-side differences in negotiation propensity.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18464 .</content>

    <title>A Low-Rank Augmented Lagrangian Method for Doubly Nonnegative Relaxations of Mixed-Binary Quadratic Programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low-Rank Approaches to Large-Scale DNN OptimizationDoubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxations are a powerful tool for approximating large-scale mixed-binary quadratic programs, but their size—often involving millions of constraints—makes them difficult to solve. We propose RiNNAL, a Riemannian augmented Lagrangian method that exploits the low-rank structure often present in optimal solutions. By applying a low-rank decomposition, RiNNAL reformulates most quadratic constraints into simpler affine ones, reducing problem complexity and mitigating issues caused by violations of Slater’s condition. A key innovation is showing that the required metric projection onto a certain algebraic variety, although nonconvex in form, can be solved as a convex optimization problem under mild regularity conditions, enforced through constraint reformulation. RiNNAL is versatile, handling not only DNN relaxations but also general semidefinite programs with polyhedral constraints. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks confirm its efficiency and robustness, making RiNNAL a promising solver for large-scale optimization problems.</content>

    <title>Local Cost Synergies in Reverse Auctions: An Application to Road Salt Procurement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Each winter, Minnesota’s Department of Transportation purchases nearly a quarter-million tons of road salt through competitive auctions. In Local Cost Synergies in Reverse Auctions: An Application to Road Salt Procurement (Gupta, Schmitt, and Stamatopoulos), the authors show that large firms benefit from “local cost synergies” when they win clusters of nearby depots. Because these synergies reduce costs, large firms are able to bid about 9% lower, on average, than they would otherwise. This cost advantage sharply reduces the probability that small firms will win contracts and leads simultaneous auctions to allocate depots less efficiently than possible. The authors conclude that any rigorous examination of procurement auctions must explicitly account for local cost synergies; ignoring them risks producing misleading results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of information processing and learning about expected future cashflows on the level and timing of risk premiums in the cross section of firms. Learning with information sources of different qualities endogenously generates value firms, growth firms, and a value premium in equilibrium. Furthermore, the learning model predicts an upward-sloping equity term structure for value firms and a flat equity term structure for growth firms. Using earnings, return, and news data on value and growth firms, we show that the predictions of the learning model are consistent with the data.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: Research support from Long-Term Investors@UniTo, the University of Neuchatel, and the University of Toronto is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05922 .</content>

    <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Strategies with Predictive and Prognostic Covariates in Adaptive Clinical Trials</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Biomedical research may uncover insights regarding the interaction of the treatments of a disease with patient covariates. We show how to use such insights to improve the efficiency of adaptive clinical trials for precision medicine by extending ideas from optimal Bayesian learning. We present a model for response-adaptive multi-arm clinical trials that leverages knowledge about the predictive-prognostic covariate structure to accelerate the learning of personalized treatment strategies that obtain the best expected outcomes for post-trial patients. Our base model is a contextual linear bandit for best-arm identification, and outcomes may be observed with delay. We characterize the optimal policy for sequentially allocating treatments to in-trial patients and, because it is hard to compute, propose several computable heuristics based on Bayesian one-step look-ahead techniques. We prove that several of our proposed heuristics are asymptotically optimal in learning treatment strategies. Numerical results based on two case studies motivated by sepsis management show that our heuristics can significantly improve clinical trial efficiency to learn a treatment strategy for precision medicine. We provide extensions that allow for rewards from outcomes of in-trial patients (resolving the exploration-exploitation tradeoff) and for inferring covariate structure using Lasso when biomedical insights on covariate structure are lacking. Our proposed trial design is of interest to funders, designers, and managers of clinical trials. It may also apply to other contextual bandit problems in settings where insights about covariate-treatment interactions are available.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [Grant 676129].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we develop novel measures of managerial labor market classification and competition by constructing networks of compensation benchmarking peers disclosed in proxy statements. These networks represent firms’ relative positions within the managerial labor market. Our classifications strongly predict executive moves across firms, outperforming a comprehensive set of predictors in the literature. Subsequent tests further demonstrate the strength of our methodology in capturing the multidimensional and dynamic features of the managerial labor market. We also validate our competition measures by showing that they are associated with retention tools, such as higher equity pay and longer pay duration. Finally, we apply our measures to test two theoretical predictions. First, we find that labor market competition could explain controversial pay practices. Second, we demonstrate that the labor market provides managers with tournament incentives to deliver superior future performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While startup accelerators often benefit founders and their ventures, these gains may not be uniform. We examine how founders' pre‐entry knowledge—the cumulative education, industry experience, and entrepreneurial exposure that teams acquire prior to launching their startups—shapes the heterogeneous returns to accelerator participation. We propose two potential mechanisms driving these returns:knowledge compensation, whereby accelerators fill gaps in basic knowledge and competencies, andknowledge complementarity, whereby accelerators amplify the absorption and deployment of expert knowledge. Using data from 6723 startups and their founding teams, we find evidence in support of the complementarity mechanism. Our findings also suggest that the returns to accelerator participation are contingent on the alignment between founders' pre‐entry knowledge and program design.Managerial SummaryWhile startup accelerators aim to level the entrepreneurial playing field, we find that founders with substantial pre‐entry knowledge and experience tend to gain more from participation in these programs than novice entrepreneurs, potentially widening startup performance gaps. Program design also appears to play a key role. While specialized and unstructured programs offer value for seasoned entrepreneurs by building complementary knowledge, structured and generalist programs offer some, albeit limited, opportunities for less‐experienced teams to build foundational skills. These findings underscore the need for tailored programming that aligns with participants' learning needs. For program designers and policymakers, these findings suggest investing in diverse formats to support varied founder profiles. For entrepreneurs, they highlight the importance of selecting programs that complement and build upon their team's prior knowledge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the U.S. housing credit boom, publicly traded banks increased mortgage lending activity and relaxed standards much more than privately held banks. The increase in risk had real effects for a variety of county-level aggregates including employment and consumption. Cross-sectional evidence and a quasi-experiment indicate that the increase in risk stemmed from the institutional ownership and the equity compensation of publicly traded banks, in turn leading banks to place greater weight on short-term equity performance. These results are consistent with the view that a focus on short-term earnings and stock prices amplifies boom–bust credit cycles, in turn leading to real cycles for the aggregate economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use novel surveys of firms and workers, linked to administrative employer-employee data, to study the prevalence and importance of individual bargaining in wage determination. We show that simple survey questions accurately elicit firms’ bargaining strategies. Using the elicited strategies for 772 German firms, we document that the majority of firms are willing to engage in individual wage bargaining. Labor market factors predict firms’ strategies better than firm characteristics. Survey responses from nearly 10,000 full-time workers indicate that most workers provide their salary expectations before they receive a job offer. Most outside offers are rejected, with the worker remaining at the incumbent firm. There is substantial heterogeneity in workers’ bargaining behavior, which translates into within-firm wage inequality. Firms that set pay via individual bargaining have a 3 percentage point higher gender wage gap.</content>

    <title>Diversifying Society’s Leaders? The Determinants and Causal Effects of Admission to Highly Selective Private Colleges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use anonymized admissions data from several colleges linked to income tax records and SAT and ACT test scores to study the determinants and causal effects of attending Ivy-Plus colleges (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and Chicago). Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at Ivy-Plus colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, and (3) athletic recruitment. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average flagship public college increases students- chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 50%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and almost triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. The three factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas academic credentials such as SAT/ACT scores are highly predictive of post-college success.</content>

    <title>Disruptive Timing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the role of strategic timing in disruptive innovation. We construct a model where an entrant decides when to enter with a potentially disruptive technology and the incumbent determines whether and when to switch from its existing technology. By accounting for endogenous firm-specific learning alongside exogenous technological improvement, our model highlights the critical role of timing in shaping disruption. First, an entrant’s strategic timing—whether to enter early or delay entry—can cause disruption by deferring the timing of the incumbent’s response or deterring it altogether. Second, we identify conditions where incumbents, even those unable to initially mount a response, can later switch to the disruptive technology and coexist with an entrant. Based on these insights, we propose a typology of five distinct disruption types—Perfect, Postponed, Passing, Phased, and Partial—that expands the traditional understanding of disruption beyond the often-studied “perfect” cases to comprehend transient and mixed cases as well. Our theory of disruptive timing integrates literature on strategic timing and disruptive innovation to offer a new perspective for scholars and actionable insights for practitioners.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01734 .</content>

    <title>How Does Health Insurance Affect Firm Employment and Performance? Evidence from Obamacare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article discusses how mandating employers to provide health insurance of a minimum quality and the associated increases in health insurance premia affect firm employment and performance. Using firm-level employee health insurance data around the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we show that the PPACA is associated with a significant increase in health insurance premia for employees in company-sponsored health insurance plans. In response, employers with greater exposure to the PPACA reduce employee enrollments in their health insurance plans to a larger extent after the law’s enactment. Our analysis suggests that employers achieve this reduction in enrollment by shifting employment composition from full-time employees to part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, who are not covered in employer-sponsored health insurance plans. Furthermore, we find no evidence of deterioration in performance at companies more exposed to the increase in health insurance premia. Overall, our findings illustrate how firms adapt to and mitigate cost increases associated with regulatory changes through strategic labor practices.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03761 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can we compare approaches to increase retirement savings? Messaging interventions, active choice frameworks, and automatic enrollment all increase retirement savings, but evidence supporting these approaches spans widely different institutional settings, populations, and time periods. In this study, we use experimental and quasi-experimental variation in these approaches within a constant setting using interventions in the U.S. military during 2016–2018. We find large differences in the efficacy of these approaches, with active choice and automatic enrollment programs being about 10 and 100 times more effective than messaging interventions, respectively. We also collect novel data on program costs and generate estimates of cost-effectiveness for each program. We find that active choice and automatic enrollment are consistently more cost effective than any messaging interventions, active choice programs are the most cost-effective for small firms, and automatic enrollment is the most cost-effective program for larger firms.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the TIAA Institute, Wharton School’s Pension Research Council and Boettner Center, the Social Security Administration, and the NBER Retirement and Disability Research Center for financial support.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compassion ventures addressing human suffering after disasters are gaining attention in entrepreneurship research, yet little is known about their potential to expand beyond immediate response. This 19-month qualitative study examines a compassion venture amid the Russo-Ukrainian war and shows how self-reliant, joint, and political forms of entrepreneurial resourcefulness help compassion ventures emerge, formalize, and expand with key partners. We uncover how these forms interact, helping compassion ventures transition to enduring organizations over a prolonged crisis. We present a model of resourcefulness dynamics in compassion venture expansion, emphasizing its political dimension, and contribute to research on compassion venturing and entrepreneurial resourcefulness.</content>

    <title>Full of It: Strategic Lying, Epistemic Conflict, and Issue Field Polarization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although scholars across several disciplines have noted the “posttruth” turn in public discourse, institutionalists provide little insight into the use of lying as a form of strategic discourse in contesting institutionalized practices, values, and beliefs. We address this gap by developing theory about the role that lies play in the discursive contestation of issue fields. We posit the concept of strategic lies (i.e., lies intended to manipulate the institutionalized practices, values, and beliefs at the focus of an issue field) and explicate how such lies cause epistemic conflicts (i.e., discursive conflicts between the field’s discrete communities over the truth value of those lies). We suggest that these epistemic conflicts increase a field’s level of polarization and concomitantly destabilize the field’s institutional status quo. We highlight the integral role that media organizations play in epistemic conflicts by explaining how such organizations frame statements as strategic lies and publicize them to the communities comprising an issue field. We assert that strategic lies can catalyze vicious cycles of polarization and epistemic conflict in issue fields. Our study thus provides a novel and rigorous conceptualization of the important role of strategic lying in the institutional processes structuring a field.</content>

    <title>Consider or Choose? The Role and Power of Consideration Sets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consideration sets play a crucial role in discrete choice modeling, where customers often form consideration sets in the first stage and then use a second-stage choice mechanism to select the product with the highest utility. Although many recent studies aim to improve choice models by incorporating more sophisticated second-stage choice mechanisms, this paper takes a step back and goes into the opposite extreme. We simplify the second-stage choice mechanism to its most basic form and focus on modeling customer choice by emphasizing the role and power of the first-stage consideration set formation. To this end, we study a model that is parameterized solely by a distribution over consideration sets with a bounded rationality interpretation. Intriguingly, we show that this model is characterized by the axiom of symmetric demand cannibalization, enabling complete statistical identification. The latter finding highlights the critical role of consideration sets in the identifiability of two-stage choice models. We also examine the model’s implications for assortment planning, proving that the optimal assortment is revenue-ordered within each partition block created by consideration sets. Despite this compelling structure, we establish that the assortment problem under this model is NP-hard even to approximate, highlighting how consideration sets contribute to nontractability, even under the simplest uniform second-stage choice mechanism. Finally, using real-world data, we show that the model achieves prediction performance comparable to other advanced choice models. Given the simplicity of the model’s second-stage phase, this result showcases the enormous power of first-stage consideration set formation in capturing customers’ decision-making processes.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00442 .</content>

    <title>Beyond Discrete‐Time Hazard Regression: Bayesian Regularization for Dynamic Churn Modeling</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discrete‐time hazard regression is widely applied to firm‐level time‐to‐event analyses and increasingly to individual churn behaviors. While the discrete logit hazard model for panel data remains the workhorse in OM, both fixed‐effects and random‐effects specifications have key limitations. The Grassia(II)‐Geometric (G2G) model—allowing for dynamic churn and asymmetric heterogeneity—offers a compelling alternative for hazard regression and churn prediction. To address high‐dimensional data, we propose Bayesian sparsity modeling via spike‐and‐slab LASSO (SSL) that enables simultaneous regularization and inference—both crucial for explanatory hypothesis testing. Simulation studies show that even when data are generated from logit functions with additive heterogeneity, asymmetric heterogeneity undermines logit regression, whereas G2G‐SSL achieves stronger out‐of‐sample fit with lower false discovery rates. We further validate its predictive power in an empirical study on voluntary employee turnover at a Fortune 500 manufacturer. The proposed approach outperforms a range of advanced methods, improving both churn time prediction and cost efficiency for prescriptive workforce planning. Finally, we outline methodological extensions and provide a modeling procedure for discrete hazard regression analysis. By importing insights from marketing and Bayesian statistics, our work enables OM scholars to move beyond traditional hazard models and better capture real‐world heterogeneity across a broad range of contractual churn scenarios.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Asset Selling</title>
    <updated>2025-11-06T14:39:40+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online asset-selling businesses, such as used cars and real estate platforms, have experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Unlike general retail operations, which make decisions at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level, asset selling operates at the individual unit asset level. Practical operational constraints (e.g., infrequent price adjustments within a limited timeframe) set asset-selling platforms apart from general retail. Further complicating decision-making are real-world uncertainties, such as volatile demand and unknown latent value of the asset. We present a dynamic pricing framework that captures the salient characteristics of the asset-selling business while leveraging consumer online behavioral data to maximize the payoff of individual assets. We develop practical algorithms for solving the dynamic pricing problem, including a mean approximation (MA) algorithm that uses forecast mean values as proxies for future customer arrival rates and online learning algorithms that integrate learning of the latent value of an asset with dynamic pricing decisions. To evaluate these algorithms, we propose an asymptotic regime suitable for the online asset-selling business context, one that scales up customer demand arrival rate within a finite time horizon. The key findings are that, under mild conditions, the expected value of selling an asset is concave and increasing at a logarithmic rate with respect to demand rates and increasing no faster than a linear speed in the asset’s latent value. These properties allow us to derive the performance bounds of our policies. An extensive numerical study and a real-data calibrated case study demonstrate the practical value of our proposed algorithms, suggesting that those simple heuristics can achieve strong performance in the asset-selling environment. Moreover, our integration of the learning of an asset’s latent value with dynamic pricing decisions, alongside asymptotic analysis, provides a robust framework for data-driven decision-making and demonstrates the potential of consumer behavior data as a strategic asset for online asset-selling platforms.</content>

    <title>The News in Earnings Announcement Disclosures: Capturing Word Context Using LLM Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the information content of textual disclosures in firms’ earnings announcements. Using a large language model (LLM) to capture information in both words and word context, I show that the news in earnings press releases (i) explains three times more variation in short-window stock returns than a host of textual measures based on dictionary and non-LLM machine learning methods; (ii) doubles the R2of an array of financial statement surprises, modeled with conventional regression or machine learning approaches; and (iii) accounts for a large fraction of immediate price revisions within just five minutes of release. LLM-modeled conference calls further enhance R2by one fourth compared with press releases and financial surprises. Textual disclosures are more informative when earnings are less persistent and during periods of aggregate uncertainty. Most news arises from text describing numbers, at the beginning of the disclosure, and including novel contents. These findings highlight the role of firms’ textual disclosures in moving stock prices and advance our understanding of how investors utilize corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Naveen Jindal School of Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05417 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theoretical framework for network-motivated forbearance lending, or forbearance lending to influential buyers and sellers in a supply network. Because dominant banks in a financial market internalize the negative externality of an influential firm’s exit, they may continue to refinance a loss-making influential firm at an interest rate lower than the prime rate. This type of forbearance lending is distinct from other strategies such as evergreening or gambling for resurrection, and we show that network-motivated forbearance lending is independent of the financial soundness of the bank and can be welfare improving. To evaluate the extent of the externality of an influential seller or buyer, we propose two measures: the price influence coefficient and the demand influence coefficient, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Seimeikai Foundation; the Seoul National University Institute of Economic Research, Housing and Commercial Bank Economic Research Fund; the Nomura Foundation; and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grants 15K01217, 16K13367, 17K03818, 20K20511, 23243050, 26245037, 26590051].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00459 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between price-fixing cartels and firm innovation using a data set encompassing all 461 cartel cases and 1,818 firms identified in the United States in the years 1975–2016. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals a positive relationship between collusion and innovation. Colluding firms exhibited increases of 28% in patent filings, 20% in top-quality patents, and 16% in research and development investment. Innovation breadth also expanded by 16%, suggesting that firms explored new technological areas. Once cartels were dissolved, innovation activities reverted to precollusion levels. The effect varied across industries and was more pronounced in fast-growing and patent-intensive industries, underscoring the importance of technological opportunities. Further, the umbrella pricing effect that also benefits noncolluding competitors offers a unique opportunity to unpack mechanisms. Results reveal that the extra financial resources account for at least a quarter of the effect with stronger cartels exhibiting more pronounced effects. Specifically, firms that relied more on internal financing before collusion and that generated higher revenues during collusion showed a greater effect; no evidence was found of capital reallocation within firms. As much as the remaining three quarters of the effect can be attributed to managerial expectations of future profitability. These findings offer insights for managers and policymakers aiming to foster novel innovation although careful interpretation is required given the heterogeneous effects.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01838 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the career consequences experienced by professional cyclists implicated in performance-enhancing drug use as well the spillover effects experienced by their teammates and managers using a data set that observes members of all teams from 2000 to 2011. Our data captures publicly known doping implications that range from informal suspicions published in the media to formal convictions by antidoping and law enforcement authorities. Our unique setting, characterized by expectations of widespread doping despite a rigorous antidoping regulatory regime and close media scrutiny, provides a new perspective on the multilayered ways that actors in competitive industries assess the competing demands of extreme performance pressures versus playing by the rules. We find that only the most severe rules violations are associated with career interruptions for riders, whereas lesser offenses are not. More ambiguous cases of doping, those based on informal suspicion or moderately punished formal convictions, are associated with career interruptions primarily for the sport’s high-performing stars. In contrast to most prior work on spillover effects from peer misconduct, we find that most riders are at a lower risk of career interruptions following teammates’ doping convictions—an effect we attribute to a vetting process in which regulators proactively target peers for increased monitoring, which resolves uncertainties about peers’ doping. Regarding spillover effects on managers’ careers, we find that only extreme levels of formal convictions that signal major team scandals are associated with increased risk of managerial career interruptions. Together, our results suggest an industry-level incentive structure that supports widespread misconduct in a competitive industry despite rigorous monitoring and enforcement.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03681 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms aggressively compete for the participants who create content on their sites. In this study, we delve into one tactic of this competition that has become increasingly popular but received limited scholarly attention—the extension of length limits (i.e., the maximum number of characters in a post)—and how it affects both the production and consumption of social media posts. We investigate these questions by exploiting a natural experiment, the phased rollout of length limit extensions on a leading Chinese microblog platform. Findings suggest that extending length limits significantly increased the number of daily posts of individual users. However, and strikingly, only already active users appear to post more after the extension with little observed change from less active users. Further, results show that extending length limits increases the number of likes each post receives, indicating that extensions improve content quality and may increase engagement in the long term. This suggests that, by permitting longer posts, social media platforms can facilitate engagement from both the post generators and audiences (at least in terms of likes). However, findings also suggest that extending length limits risks further concentrating content generation from the vocal minority, thereby making the silent majority less visible on the platforms.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03629 .</content>

    <title>A Sample Size Calculation for Training and Certifying Targeting Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for determining the sample size required when using an experiment to train and certify a targeting policy. Calculating the rate at which the performance of a targeting model improves with additional training data is a complex problem. We address this challenge by assuming that customers are grouped into segments that capture relevant information about their responsiveness to the firm’s marketing actions. We consider two problem formulations. The first formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that its expected performance exceeds a predefined threshold. The second formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that it outperforms a baseline in an out-of-sample statistical test. We establish theoretical properties of these problems, based on which we propose computationally efficient algorithms for optimal sample size calculations. We illustrate our algorithms and analysis using data from a luxury fashion retailer.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02947 .</content>

    <title>Blocking Block Formation: Evidence from Private Loan Contracts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the structure of the borrower’s equity ownership matter in debt contracting? This paper addresses this question by examining change in control clauses. These clauses are pervasive in loan contracts, yet their terms are not boilerplate. Examining 14,940 contracts, we document significant heterogeneity in the use and size of ownership caps, which limit large equity block formation. Overall, our evidence indicates that the way equity capital is distributed matters to lenders. Lenders set lower caps to mitigate risks arising from power contests among shareholders, formation of a new (coordinating) block, potentially resulting in activism, and hostile takeover threats via toehold strategies. We confirm some of these effects using two quasi-natural experiments. Caps below 50% are associated with a drop in firm value but not in the cost of debt, consistent with exacerbated firm-manager agency costs. Finally, two findings shed light on ways creditors may influence corporate governance: the largest block size increases when these minority block restrictions expire, and the likelihood of withdrawing an announced buyback increases during the life of these loans.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04224 .</content>

    <title>Project Networks and Reallocation Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A project involves several participants—including clients, contractors, and subcontractors—that work concurrently on multiple projects and allocate resources among them. This interdependency creates a network of otherwise-unrelated projects. We map the network of U.S. government projects involving over 150,000 participants. We show that a seemingly localized disruption, affecting only one project site, eventually causes delays across unrelated projects. This is because participants opportunistically reallocate resources into disrupted projects, at the expense of other projects, triggering a domino effect of further reallocations in the network. Thus, the costs of on-site disruptions end up being shared by multiple participants in the network, rather than being fully absorbed by the affected project. Performance-based incentives, which reward contractors for timeliness, exacerbate these externalities by encouraging self-interested resource reallocation.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2017-04523].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01574 .</content>

    <title>The (Heterogeneous) Economic Effects of Private Equity Buyouts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effects of private equity buyouts on employment, productivity, and job reallocation vary tremendously with macroeconomic and credit conditions, across private equity groups, and by type of buyout. We reach this conclusion by examining the most extensive database of U.S. buyouts ever compiled, encompassing thousands of buyout targets from 1980 to 2013 and millions of control firms. Employment shrinks 12% over two years after buyouts of publicly listed firms—on average, and relative to control firms—but expands 15% after buyouts of privately held firms. Postbuyout productivity gains at target firms are large on average and much larger yet for deals executed amid tight credit conditions. A postbuyout tightening of credit conditions or slowing of gross domestic product growth curtails employment growth and intrafirm job reallocation at target firms. We also show that buyout effects differ across the private equity groups that sponsor buyouts, and these differences persist over time at the group level. Rapid upscaling in deal flow at the group level brings lower employment growth at target firms. We relate these findings to theories of private equity that highlight agency problems at portfolio firms and within the private equity industry itself.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Harvard Business School’s Division of Research, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation [Grant no. 2014-0136], and the Private Capital Research Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03890 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leading retailers have opened up their online storefronts to competitors by operating marketplaces for third-party sellers. We develop a model of entry and price competition at the product market level to analyze the competitive interactions arising within these retailer-led marketplaces. We show that the retailer benefits from the marketplace by mitigating his own capacity constraints and manages competition from third-party sellers through his control of the storefront: by setting the marketplace fee, by steering consumers, and by allocating his own capacity in response to the product supply choices of third-party sellers. We draw managerial implications and examine policy interventions. We find that regulation of marketplace fees has the strongest potential to increase welfare outcomes. Our model provides novel insights into the mechanisms at play in retailer-led marketplaces and explains their prominent role in online retail.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council [Grant FAPoD 101044072]; Fundación Carmen y Severo Ochoa [Grant CEX2019-000915-S]; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [Grant RYC-2016-20307]; BBVA Foundation grant within program “Ayudas Fundacion BBVA a Equipos de Investigacion Cientifica 2019.”</content>

    <title>Does Employer-Paid, Job-Protected Maternity Leave Help or Hurt Female IT Workers? Evidence from Millions of Job Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid maternity leave is considered an important pathway to increasing women’s participation in information technology (IT), as it helps address work-family balance concerns, which are pronounced in the field due to long hours, travel, and the need to keep up with technology. Many governments require that employers pay for maternity leave. Using microlevel data on millions of applications from an online job portal, our study examines whether a policy change in India that expanded employer-paid, job-protected maternity leave for companies with 10 or more employees from short-term (12 weeks) to medium-term (26 weeks) changes companies’ likelihood of considering female applicants for IT jobs. Specifically, postlegislation, we expect that less profitable companies may penalize women in the hiring process because employers must bear the costs associated with providing maternity benefits; we find that women were ∼22% less likely to be invited for an interview, postlegislation, at companies with low profitability. Moreover, at such companies, we do not observe a postlegislation change in applications by women. These results identify an important source of leakage in the pipeline for female IT workers. Additionally, our study suggests that legislation which mandates that maternity leave be paid for by employers (50% of economies that guarantee maternity leave of 14 weeks or longer require that employers fully or partially pay for maternity leave) should be accompanied by the introduction and enforcement of associated laws and guardrails—for example, parental leave and antidiscriminatory laws—to ensure that the spirit of the maternity leave legislation is upheld.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the National Science Foundation [Award 2151311] and Bright Data [in-kind contributions] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.00380 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulators have increasingly mandated firms to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents upon discovering these incidents. We find suggestive evidence indicating that some firms manipulate the discovery date (“misreport”) of a cybersecurity incident to postpone the disclosure of the incident, as evidenced by a pronounced spike in insider sales before the reported discovery date. We also find that misreporting is more prevalent among firms with weak internal control systems, when firms face low litigation risk, and when firms have greater pressure to meet a disclosure deadline. Further, firms suspected of misreporting tend to disclose their remedial actions and assert the restoration of business, mitigating negative market reactions upon disclosure of incidents. Collectively, our results suggest that firms might strategically misreport information about a cybersecurity incident to delay disclosure to gain additional time for remedial actions, which helps them prevent exposing vulnerabilities to malicious actors and alleviate stakeholder anxiety.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01058 .</content>

    <title>Startup Accelerators, Information Asymmetry, and Corporate Venture Capital Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beyond financial incentives, investments by Corporate Venture Capitalists (CVCs) are often motivated by strategic objectives, such as gaining early exposure to emerging technologies. However, in the presence of information asymmetry, CVCs tend to invest in startups with a high degree of business relatedness—startups that are less risky but lacking in knowledge novelty—which are not ideal for achieving their strategic objectives. With startup accelerators showing promise in mitigating the information asymmetry problem, we examine how a CVC’s investment pattern in a region shifts following a startup accelerator’s entry, with a particular interest in the degree of business relatedness between the CVC’s parent corporation and its portfolio companies. Analyses reveal that CVCs increase investments in startups that are dissimilar to their parent’s business following the entry of startup accelerators. We show that the two pathways through which accelerators reduce information asymmetry—quality signals, and mentorship and training—likely contribute to this change. In addition, the change is most pronounced for CVCs whose parent firm operates in an IT-using—rather than an IT-producing—industry, suggesting that accelerators help IT-using firms gain a foothold in the technology space through CVC investments. These findings deepen the understanding of the role that startup accelerators play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem against the backdrop of digital transformation occurring in nearly every industry.This paper was accepted by Kartik Hosanagar, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03494 .</content>

    <title>Organizational Culture, Innovation, and Competitive Performance: A Multilevel Dynamic Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic evolutionary model of innovation culture and its organizational effects at three levels. At the frontline level, informal bottom-up innovation ideas are driven by unplanned interactions governed by cultural norms, as frontline employees sort themselves into idea generator or implementor behaviors. Management cannot directly control innovation interactions and thus culture, but it can imperfectly nudge it by influencing a sharing norm at the second level. At the third level, the culture influences the innovation performance and productivity of the firm and is thus relevant for the organization’s competitiveness. This modeling approach disentangles how top-down strategy interacts with implicit frontline dynamics of cultural evolution, in the context of innovation. Unguided culture does not lead to maximum firm performance. Management guidance may or may not improve performance, and industry competition may select higher-performing cultures, which then spread through the industry under some circumstances. We characterize under which conditions management has a strong influence on culture and performance and under which conditions performance is driven more by forces outside of management’s control.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05087 .</content>

    <title>The Joint Determination of Haircuts and Interest Rates for Collateralized Loans in Shadow Banking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the joint determination of haircuts and interest rates for collateralized loans in shadow banking within a general equilibrium model. Three results emerge. First, higher downside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs below the debt face value) reduces haircuts only under certain conditions, whereas higher upside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs above the debt face value) always increases them. Second, the relative insensitivity of interest rates to shocks, compared with haircuts, occurs when shocks affect only the upside collateral quality and can also arise endogenously, with changes in haircuts amplified and changes in interest rates dampened. Third, when depositors’ saving needs increase, interest rates unexpectedly rise while haircut requirements are relaxed. The same effects occur when banks’ collateral supply shrinks.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00541 .</content>

    <title>Typical Ranges as Scale-Specific Benchmarks: When and Why Percentages Amplify Relative Magnitudes and Their Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business managers and policymakers must often communicate magnitudes. Yet conveying large relative magnitudes without desensitizing people to further increases can be challenging because of diminishing sensitivity to large numbers. In this research, we propose that percentage expressions not only make large relative magnitudes (e.g., 500%) appear larger than equivalent non-percentage expressions but also make large increases in relative magnitudes (e.g., from 500% to 600%) appear larger. We posit an explanation: percentages typically have values between 0% and 100%, so when percentages and percentage-point differences reach 100% or more, they seem unusually large. This hypothesis is supported by data scraped from New York Times articles and a series of online experiments employing both management-relevant scenarios and incentive-compatible decisions. Existing theories of magnitude perception either cannot predict all the results of these studies (e.g., numerosity and unitosity) or need further specification to do so (e.g., decision-by-sampling and range-frequency theory). We discuss implications for the theory of magnitude and difference perception and the practice of communicating large magnitudes and changes.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02646 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When home prices threaten to decline, large mortgage investors can benefit from fostering new lending that boosts demand. We ask whether this benefit contributed to the growth in acquisitions of risky mortgages by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) in the first half of 2007. We find that it helps explain the variation of this growth across regions, as well as regional house price and credit changes. The growth predicted by this benefit is on top of the acquisition growth caused by the exit of private-label securitizers. We conclude that the GSEs actively targeted their acquisitions to counter home-price declines.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05912 .</content>

    <title>The Informativeness of Balance Sheet Disaggregations: Evidence from Forecasting Operating Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the usefulness of balance sheet disaggregations in the context of forecasting operating asset growth and its implications for revenue growth. We show that models using disaggregated balance sheet information have greater accuracy than models that use only aggregate information, with the most accurate disaggregation scheme separately considering property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, other noncurrent operating assets, and current operating assets. When investigating market participants’ use of disaggregated balance sheet information, we find that differences in growth predictions from a disaggregated model and an aggregate model are associated with year-ahead abnormal returns, suggesting that investors do not fully utilize disaggregated balance sheet information. We corroborate this result by showing that returns are concentrated around the earnings announcement, are more pronounced for stocks with low transient institutional ownership, and are consistent with subsequent improvements in actual financial performance. Finally, we find that these returns are driven by both the asset growth predictions of a disaggregated model and the ability of such a model to incorporate the unique revenue-generating ability of individual asset components. Importantly, we find that our results are incremental to the information embedded in income statement disaggregations, even when forecasting income statement items such as profitability. Overall, our study provides evidence on the informativeness of balance sheet disaggregations and proposes the use of disaggregated models when forecasting growth in operating assets and its implications for future revenues.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org10.1287/mnsc.2023.01413 .</content>

    <title>Shaping Police Officer Mindsets and Behaviors: Experimental Evidence of Procedural Justice Training</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on organizational justice shows that perceptions of justice by internal and external agents are reliable predictors of key organizational outcomes. But how can we promote the enactment of fair behavior by those with decision-making authority within organizations? This is particularly important for organizations that depend on frequent client interactions, in which individual discretion is required to make consequential decisions, and where necessary evils are unavoidable. Few organizations face this challenge as intensely as police forces, in which misconduct and bad decisions by their street-level bureaucrats can have large negative consequences. This paper analyzes whether police officers can be trained to effectively incorporate the principles of procedural justice in their interactions with citizens. In collaboration with the Mexico City police, we implemented a randomized controlled trial with 1,854 officers to measure whether procedural justice training changed their perceptions of policing and actual behavior on the field. We find significant and positive effects of the training across all measures of the procedural justice model. Our research yields insights into critical elements to consider in organizational training programs, including managerial alignment with the objectives of the training and a consideration of employees’ perceptions of the extent to which their work is understood by others.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: This research was funded by the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) [Grant SINLEC17CA2007].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03243 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how periodic uncertainty about skilled labor supply affects corporate investment using the H-1B visa program for skilled workers as an empirical setting. Exploiting cross-regional variation in H-1B labor flows based on historical immigrant enclaves, we find that firms in regions that attract more H-1B workers concentrate their investments in the quarter after uncertainty about visa access is resolved by the H-1B lottery. Consistent with a skilled labor uncertainty channel, we find that the investment spikes are confined to industries where invested capital cannot be easily redeployed, to firms that cannot easily find domestic substitutes for lost H-1B workers, and to firms that cannot easily arrange alternative employment visas for their foreign employees.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: S.-J.

    <title>Joint Placement, Delivery Promise, and Fulfillment in Online Retail</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions of an online retailer. We have a set of products with given numbers of units to be placed at capacitated fulfillment centers. Once we make the placement decisions, we face demands for the products arriving from different demand regions randomly over time. In response to each demand, we pick a delivery promise to offer, which determines the probability that the demand converts into sales as well as choose a fulfillment center to use to serve the demand. Our goal is to decide where to place the units at the beginning of the selling horizon and to find a policy to make delivery promise and fulfillment decisions over the selling horizon so that we maximize the total expected profit. We give an approximation strategy to obtain solutions with performance guarantees for this joint placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment problem. In our approximation strategy, we construct a bounding function that upper bounds the total expected profit from the delivery promise and fulfillment policy when viewed as a function of the placement decisions. To make the placement decisions, we maximize the bounding function subject to the capacity constraints at the fulfillment centers. To make the delivery promise and fulfillment decisions, we construct a policy that obtains a constant fraction of the bounding function. Using our approximation strategy with appropriate bounding functions, we obtain a solution with a constant factor performance guarantee, but if the size of the system, measured by the numbers of units that we need to place and capacities of the fulfillment centers, is large, then we get an asymptotically optimal solution. We compare our approximation strategy with approaches that ignore the interactions between the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions as well as heuristics that are based on Lagrangian relaxation, demonstrating that our approximation strategy compares quite favorably.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The work of the first and third authors was partly supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant CMMI-2226900].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform-run marketplaces may exploit third-party sellers’ data to develop competing products, but the threat of future competition can deter sellers’ entry. We explore how this trade-off affects the platform’s entry on the marketplace and the referral fee it charges to the third-party sellers. We first characterize the platform’s optimal fee under different degrees of commitment on its own entry policy. We show that full commitment maximizes not only the platform’s payoff but also consumer surplus, as the associated fee induces maximal entry by the sellers. Next, we show how and when the platform’s policy on information sharing between its marketplace and product divisions can substitute for its commitment to entry. We characterize the platform’s optimal information policy and examine how it interacts with the platform’s fee structure. We show that an outright ban on information sharing between the platform’s divisions can reduce consumer welfare as it may lead to a higher referral fee that thwarts sellers’ entry. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the platform’s fee structure as a strategic response in the policy debates on marketplace regulation.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cryptocurrencies have prompted a shift away from classic security attacks toward ransomware-based extortion. To better understand the impact of cryptocurrencies on the cybersecurity landscape, we conduct a comparative analysis of cybersecurity metrics prior to and after the adoption of cryptocurrency using a series of connected software-use models in the presence of security externalities. In this framework, we endogenize the actions of both heterogeneous consumers and attackers, with entry of the latter being driven by both the size of the unpatched consumer population and, as a subset of it, the size of the ransom-paying consumer population. We first examine users’ adoption and patching behavior under both security scenarios. We explore how changes in attacker entry costs impact outcomes under both conventional and post-crypto ransomware threat landscapes. We show that ransomware scenarios may be more desirable than conventional ones when attacker entry costs are low, provided that the gains from entering with standard attacks under the ransomware scenario are not too high. However, under such scenarios, social welfare can increase under the same conditions that lead to larger ransoms being demanded and a higher expected total ransom being paid, which presents a conundrum to policymakers. We also examine the impact of market parameters associated with security losses from conventional attacks and residual losses when victims pay in ransomware attacks.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was partially supported by Insung Research Grant of KUBS, the LG Yonam Foundation (of Korea), and an award from the Georgia Institute of Technology Center of International Business Education and Research as part of its funded research program.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00969 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test competing theories of liquidity dynamics during extreme volatility spikes (EVSs). We find that liquidity providers strategically allow for price pressures and are compensated from correcting pricing errors. As a result, liquidity provision intensifies toward the end of a typical EVS. This goes counter to a widespread concern that market-making constraints cause liquidity to deteriorate as EVSs develop. The prevailing limit order book dynamics during EVSs are in line with the socially beneficial equilibrium presented in the theoretical literature.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04104 .</content>

    <title>Can Digital Aid Deliver During Humanitarian Crises?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can digital payments help reduce extreme hunger? Humanitarian needs are at their highest since 1945, aid budgets are falling behind, and hunger is concentrating in fragile states where repression and aid diversion present major obstacles. In such contexts, partnering directly with governments is often neither feasible nor desirable, making private digital payment platforms a potentially useful means of delivering assistance. We experimentally evaluated digital payments to extremely poor, female-headed households in Afghanistan, as part of a partnership between community, nonprofit, and private organizations. The payments led to substantial improvements in food security and mental well-being. Despite beneficiaries’ limited tech literacy, 99.75% used the payments, and stringent checks revealed no evidence of diversion. Before seeing our results, policymakers and experts are uncertain and skeptical about digital aid, consistent with the lack of prior evidence on digital payments for humanitarian response. Delivery costs are under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Programme’s global figure for cash-based transfers. These savings can help reduce hunger without additional resources, demonstrating how hybrid partnerships utilizing digital payment platforms can help address grand challenges in difficult contexts.This paper was accepted by Caroline Flammer, sustainability.Funding: Research funding was provided by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, awarded through the J-PAL Crime and Violence Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06469 .</content>

    <title>Do Managers Successfully Shop for Auditors Who Allow Them to Opportunistically Report Positive News? Evidence from Accounting Estimates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior auditor shopping literature examines managers’ attempts to opportunistically underreport negative news by finding auditors who will allow them to avoid negative audit opinions or underreport goodwill impairments or financial misstatements. We advance this literature by examining management attempts to opportunistically report positive news, as captured by income-increasing changes in accounting estimates. Adapting a previous framework, we find that, ex ante, managers are more (less) likely to dismiss their auditor if it increases (decreases) the expected likelihood of reporting income-increasing changes in accounting estimates (POSCHGs). We also find that, ex post, following auditor dismissals, the frequency and magnitude of POSCHGs increase, and companies reporting POSCHGs are more likely to restate earnings, receive Securities and Exchange Commission comment letters related to estimates, meet or beat earnings targets, and less likely to receive going concern opinions or violate debt covenants. Placebo tests show that none of the above results hold for income-decreasing changes in estimates. Finally, we identify several institutional factors that constrain managers’ ability to shop for lenient auditors, including the quality of the successor auditor and strong corporate governance. Collectively, our findings are consistent with managers successfully shopping for auditors who allow them to opportunistically report positive news following auditor dismissals.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05299 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of student loan forbearance on job search outcomes. Our experimental setting is the 2020 federal student loan moratorium that provided some borrowers with forbearance by pausing the payments on their student loans. We use data on unemployment insurance claims, payroll records, and credit histories to compare unemployed borrowers who received forbearance to unemployed borrowers who had to continue making payments. We find that the payment pause did not have any economically or statistically significant effects on job search durations or subsequent incomes. Further, we find no heterogeneity in these effects across borrowers’ financial, demographic, or labor market characteristics.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04047 .</content>

    <title>Position Auctions with Endogenous Product Information: Why Live-Streaming Advertising Is Thriving</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live-streaming advertising in e-commerce is soaring. Both Amazon and Alibaba have employed this novel marketing model to engage consumers by sequentially exhibiting different products through live-streaming videos. In this paper, we adopt a mechanism design framework to model live-streaming e-commerce as a position auction with endogenous provision of product information. We prove that finding the mechanism that simultaneously optimizes position allocation and information provision is NP-hard. Thus, we develop several approximation algorithms. Building on the connection to the order selection problem, our analysis establishes that heuristics relying solely on product information provision can achieve up to 66.9% of the optimal revenue in the worst case. In contrast, heuristics exploiting position allocation alone may result in arbitrarily large revenue losses. We attribute the efficacy of product information provision to its enhancement of the value of ad spots in position auctions. Our findings suggest that advertising that focuses on differentiating product information—as in live-streaming e-commerce—is more lucrative than conventional position-based sponsored search. This managerial insight remains valid when accommodating multiproduct purchases with dependency or accounting for random consumer attention spans.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72201234, 72192805], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16211619, 16502219, 16212821, 16501722, C6032-21G], and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mathematical Foundations for Artificial Intelligence [Grant 2023B1212010001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01299 .</content>

    <title>Mitigating the Negative Effects of Customer Anxiety by Facilitating Access to Human Contact</title>
    <updated>2025-11-06T14:39:40+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research in social psychology has shown that when people feel anxious, they seek advice from others. Yet, companies that operate in high-anxiety settings (like financial services, healthcare, and education) are increasingly deploying self-service technologies (SSTs), through which anxious customers transact without access to human contact. These companies may therefore face a classic efficiency–service trade-off where gains in operational efficiency through automation also hamper service outcomes by neglecting customer anxiety. This paper, set in the high-anxiety domain of financial services, investigates the value of facilitating access to human contact during SST usage. In a field experiment conducted within the context of a credit union’s SST loan-approval process, an invitation to connect with a human loan agent increases the customer uptake rate of approved loans by 24%. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments, which explicitly investigate the linkages among anxiety, choice satisfaction, and firm trust during SST encounters show that compared with participants without anxiety, those who are anxious consistently report lower satisfaction with their choices and less trust in the firm, regardless of the source of their anxiety. When anxiety is related to the SST encounter, facilitating access to human contact dampens anxiety’s negative effects on choice satisfaction and, by extension, increases firm trust. We further observe that these benefits of facilitating access to human contact arise even though very few customers choose to access a person. Taken together, this research reveals an opportunity for firms to maintain operational efficiency in high-anxiety self-service settings without compromising customer experiences and service outcomes.This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.Funding: Funding for this research, apart from internal business costs incurred by our field study partner to support the experiment, was primarily provided by Harvard Business School and partially provided by Dartmouth College.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01029 .</content>

    <title>Online Stochastic Optimization with Wasserstein-Based Nonstationarity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a general online stochastic optimization problem with multiple resource constraints over a horizon of finite time periods. In each time period, a reward function and multiple cost functions are revealed, and the decision maker needs to specify an action from a convex and compact action set to collect the reward and consume the resources. Each cost function corresponds to the consumption of one resource. The reward function and the cost functions of each time period are drawn from an unknown distribution, which is nonstationary across time. The objective of the decision maker is to maximize the cumulative reward subject to the resource constraints. This formulation captures a wide range of applications including online linear programming and network revenue management, among others. In this paper, we consider two settings: (i) a data-driven setting where the true distribution is unknown but a prior estimate (possibly inaccurate) is available and (ii) an uninformative setting where the true distribution is completely unknown. We propose a unified Wasserstein distance–based measure to quantify the inaccuracy of the prior estimate in setting (i) and the nonstationarity of the environment in setting (ii). We show that the proposed measure leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for the attainability of a sublinear regret in both settings. For setting (i), we propose an informative gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm takes a primal-dual perspective, and it integrates the prior information of the underlying distributions into an online gradient descent procedure in the dual space. The algorithm also naturally extends to the uninformative setting (ii). Under both settings, we show the corresponding algorithm achieves a regret of optimal order. We illustrate the algorithm’s performance through numerical experiments.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03850 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use panel data on expected and realized changes in household finances to study the process of expectation formation. Households extrapolate from improvements in financial situation, but deteriorations are associated with an increased dispersion of forecasts, and higher probabilities of both negative and positive forecast errors. Individuals who expect earnings declines to revert too quickly save less and are more likely to be financially worse off again in the future. Learning from past errors reduces the likelihood that individuals are optimistic following a deterioration in their finances. The evidence shows how experiences, learning, and life events matter for expectation formation.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03257 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Data-Integrated Newsvendor Solution with Operational Data Analytics (ODA)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the data-integrated newsvendor problem in which the random demand depends on a set of covariates. Observing from the solutions analyzed in the existing studies, we identify the equivariant class of operational statistics (i.e., the mapping from the demand and covariate data to the inventory decision) to develop the operational data analytics (ODA) framework for the contextual newsvendor problem. The equivariant property is intuitively appealing, and it is justified by the fact that, regardless of the sample size, no other decision rule can uniformly dominate the optimal operational statistic within the equivariant class. We also demonstrate that nonequivariant solutions can produce unstable empirical performance with limited samples, whereas equivariant solutions exhibit robustness. When the distribution family of the demand is known but the coefficients of the demand function are unknown, we can directly validate the decision performance of operational statistics within the equivariant class and derive the uniformly optimal solution. When the distribution family of the demand is unknown, we formulate the data integration model as a subclass of equivariant operational statistics, obtained through adaptively boosting some candidate solution. For decision validation, we project the validation data to the demand for the covariates of interests, and the projection is constructed by utilizing the structure of the candidate solution. We demonstrate the superior small-sample performance of adaptive boosting and establish the consistency of the boosted operational statistics. Our ODA formulation, building on the inherent characteristics of the contextual newsvendor problem, highlights the importance of understanding structural properties in data-integrated decision making.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04164 .</content>

    <title>Designing AI-Based Work Processes: How the Timing of AI Advice Affects Diagnostic Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Grants Dean Strategic Fund - Health Informatics (HIIOT)/E and NSCP/ N-171-000-499-001] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72301279].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01454 .</content>

    <title>Institutional Ties and Publications in Top Accounting Journals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Academic journals certify and disseminate scientific knowledge. However, institutional ties between journals and universities can lead to conflicts of interest that compromise peer review. I consider publication patterns in the “Top 3” accounting journals in light of the journals’ governance structures and institutional ties. The Accounting Review (TAR), governed by the American Accounting Association (AAA), has no university affiliations. Journal of Accounting and Economics (JAE) and Journal of Accounting Research (JAR) are private journals with longstanding editorial ties to specific universities: the University of Rochester, the University of Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology for JAE and the University of Chicago for JAR. For publications from 2000–2022, I find that journal-affiliated authors (current faculty and recent PhDs from journal-affiliated universities) publish disproportionately in their affiliate journal. Further analysis suggests that this pattern does not appear to be attributable primarily to authors’ journal submission preferences, particularly for JAR affiliates. In fact, JAR affiliates publish their least cited work in JAR (relative to TAR and JAE), and affiliate articles in JAR receive significantly fewer citations than articles in JAR by authors from top institutions unaffiliated with JAR. Results further suggest that institutional ties may be particularly impactful for pretenure PhD affiliates and for the publication of dissertations. The results are consistent with the idea that institutional ties may influence the publication process in accounting journals, particularly at JAR, where institutional affiliations are formalized and concentrated in one institution.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04553 .</content>

    <title>Promotion Decisions and the Adoption of Explicit Potential Assessment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we leverage the transformation of a performance management system that shifts from only providing a performance rating to also providing an explicit assessment of potential. Although performance measures enable organizations to evaluate an employee’s past performance, they provide limited information regarding the employee’s potential to perform in a prospective job that requires a different skill set. Consequently, firms are gradually moving toward the incorporation of explicit potential assessments in their annual appraisal process to evaluate the employee’s promotability to a different task environment. Our data access allows us to provide evidence on the consequences of implementing a performance management system that adopted the explicit assessment of potential. We find that, on average, the performance of promoted employees is lower after implementation, suggesting that the potential assessment system is less effective in identifying candidates suitable for promotion. Additional analyses lead us to conclude that the difficulty of evaluating employee potential reduces performance upon promotion because of inaccurate recommendations of supervisors who do not sufficiently differentiate in their ratings. We thus identify variation in supervisors’ evaluation quality as an important source of the Peter Principle.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02199 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a statistical framework of using artificial intelligence to improve human decision making. The performance of each human decision maker is benchmarked against that of machine predictions. We replace the diagnoses made by a subset of the decision makers with the recommendation from the machine learning algorithm. We apply both a heuristic frequentist approach and a Bayesian posterior loss function approach to abnormal birth detection using a nationwide data set of doctor diagnoses from prepregnancy checkups of reproductive-age couples and pregnancy outcomes. We find that our algorithm on a test data set results in a higher overall true positive rate and a lower false positive rate than the diagnoses made by doctors only.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <title>Central Bank Liquidity Backstops, Bank Regulation, and Risk-Taking by Asset Managers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Central bank liquidity backstops and bank leverage regulation interact across financial intermediaries and states of the world. A backstop is implemented only in some states to grease the wheels of bank dealers that absorb fire sales. It also incentivizes asset managers to take on excessive redemption risk. Regulation binds in other states, in which it hamstrings market making. Because this outcome increases asset managers’ fire sale costs, it reins in their risk-taking. Empirically, we confirm such a disciplining effect of regulation on U.S. money market funds. Theoretically, we derive that the two policy measures complement each other in raising social welfare because they address different sources of redemption-driven losses—fire sale costs for given risk-taking and excessive risk-taking, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06997 .</content>

    <title>A Blessing or a Curse? Teletriage Service in Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teletriage is a telehealth service that uses telecommunication technologies to remotely assess patients’ conditions and determine their needs for medical treatment. This paper examines how teletriage affects patients’ decisions to seek treatment and when healthcare providers (e.g., medical businesses, hospitals, or clinics) should launch teletriage services. Our findings reveal that teletriage can encourage more mild patients to seek treatment, discouraging more severe patients. This occurs when teletriage lacks sufficient precision and patients’ hassle cost of seeking treatment falls outside a moderate range. Specifically, when hassle costs are low, patients are generally inclined to seek treatment, but teletriage can misclassify severe patients, leading them to avoid necessary care. Conversely, when hassle costs are high, patients tend to stay home, yet teletriage can misidentify mild patients, prompting them to seek unnecessary treatment. As a result, even if teletriage is costless, healthcare providers may abandon this service even though teletriage always increases patient surplus by improving their assessment of their medical needs. Interestingly, patients can be better off seeking treatment from providers who charge higher prices as these providers are more likely to adopt teletriage services. These results caution healthcare policymakers that teletriage can exacerbate healthcare inefficiency instead of alleviating it. Nevertheless, to improve patient surplus, the government should sometimes subsidize providers to offer teletriage or allow providers to charge a higher treatment fee.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71821001, 72325005] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03292 .</content>

    <title>Does Sponsored Search Advertising Augment Organic Search? Evidence from an E-Commerce Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides empirical evidence on the performance of sponsored search advertising in a case study of an unnamed e-commerce platform. I leverage a field experiment that blocks all sponsored search advertising for 3% of site visitors. The experiment shows that sponsored search advertising both steals business from organic listings and also reduces the total volume of transactions intermediated by the platform. However, in this case study, I find that sponsored search is nonetheless profitable for the platform because ad revenue more than compensates for the reduction in commissions that the platform earns on transactions.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04792 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer preferences for product features play an important role in designing successful goods and services. Preferences for features are typically obtained by utilizing a model of choice where the utility for all but one level of an attribute is estimable. That is, the traditional discrete choice model can provide information on the change in utility between attribute-levels, but cannot separately estimate the utility associated with all levels of an attribute. In this paper, we propose a model that integrates conjoint and Maximum Difference scaling data to identify part-worth utilities for all product features, using the outside good as a common reference level, instead of the usual practice of having a reference level for each product attribute. The preference data are also integrated with satisfaction data to identify market opportunities for new and existing products. We illustrate our model with data from a survey measuring customer satisfaction and preferences for large-screen TVs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02560 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Driving Music Demand in the Age of Streaming: Understanding the Heterogeneity in Curated Playlist Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The shift from physical music consumption to online music streaming has fundamentally transformed the market for recorded music, giving consumers access to millions of songs on demand. Because streaming platforms pay artists and labels on a per-play basis, sustained listening and effective discovery have become essential for generating meaningful revenue. With traditional marketing losing relevance for recorded music, curated collections in the form of playlists have emerged as a potentially vital tool for labels to lift streaming demand. As a result, labels have started to deploy playlist marketing by either curating their own playlists or by targeting influential playlists curated by others. However, the success factors behind the impact of playlists on song demand remain insufficiently understood. An analysis of 200,455 quasi-experiments where songs are listed on playlists and later delisted shows an average listing effect of 8.5% more global streams and a carry-over effect of 4% after delisting. Although these effects are highly heterogeneous, they can be systematically explained by playlist design characteristics, including playlist popularity, the song’s prior playlist exposure, the fit between the song and playlist, curator identity, and the curation approach. These findings empower labels to deploy more informed playlist marketing to lift streaming revenue.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Design thinking (DT) has generated significant attention in relation to new product development and innovation and, more generally, value creation activities. Despite its focus on identifying and addressing the needs of users and other stakeholders in an empathetic way, several implementations of DT have resulted in ethically questionable products with negative consequences for firms, customers, and society. This research adopts a grounded theory approach to understand the main ethical concerns with DT as currently practiced and to investigate how DT teams could better include ethical considerations in their work. Based on the analysis of data gathered from in-depth interviews with DT practitioners, it identifies four ethics-related blind spots caused by: (1) the exclusion of the natural environment, (2) narrow definitions of users, (3) quick prototyping and testing, and (4) the rapid increase of scale. Using the development of a Responsible AI product as an illustration, we show that firms can develop three interrelated capabilities to mitigate these blind spots: (1) systemic inclusion of impacted entities and stakeholders, (2) anticipation and mitigation of potential harms, and (3) ethical governance. Together, they form a novel approach: Responsible Design Thinking. The article concludes by discussing our contributions to theory and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effect of nonlinear pricing on markups and misallocation. In a general equilibrium model in which firms are allowed to set a quantity-dependent pricing schedule, markup heterogeneity is not a sign of misallocation. Instead, we point to a new source of misallocation: high-taste consumers are allocated too much of each good, low-taste consumers too little. Using micro data from the retail sector, we show that nonlinear pricing is prevalent and quantify the model. Welfare losses from misallocation across consumers are substantially larger than those from misallocation across firms under linear pricing. (JEL D21, D24, D43, H25, J22, L13, L81)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper demonstrates that labor market regulations, such as minimum wages or payroll taxes, shape trade competition in labor-intensive activities. I exploit data from a large European trade program where firms from different countries supply labor services at the same location but face different payroll taxes and minimum wage rules. Country case studies and model-consistent gravity estimates show large trade responses to tax and regulatory reforms, with an elasticity of trade in services to labor costs larger than one. The results imply that absent regulatory and fiscal harmonization, export competitiveness depends, in part, on domestic labor market policies. (JEL F14, F16, F42, H25, J22, J23, K31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of quid pro quo (technology for market access) in facilitating knowledge spillovers and quality upgrading in the Chinese automobile industry. The identification strategy exploits within-product quality variation across a rich set of quality dimensions. We find affiliated domestic automakers adopt more similar quality strengths of their joint venture partners, consistent with knowledge spillovers. Additional analysis suggests worker flows and supplier networks mediate knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers due to ownership affiliation under quid pro quo contributed 8.3 percent of the quality improvement experienced by affiliated domestic models from 2001 to 2014, relative to nonaffiliated domestic models.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Identifying the optimal set of individuals to first receive information (“seeds”) in a social network to maximize expected diffusion is a widely studied question in many settings. Several studies propose network-centrality-based heuristics to select seeds likely to increase diffusion. Here, we show that, for the classic independent cascade model of diffusion, either seeding a few more individuals at random can prompt a larger diffusion than optimal seeding or optimal seeding itself results in limited spread. These findings hold across a broad range of random networks and are supported by simulations on real-world networks. (JEL D83, D85, O12, O18, P25, P32, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the strong negative effect of higher mortgage rates on cash-out refinancing reflects substitution into other borrowing products, not large changes in total new household borrowing. We exploit plausibly exogenous changes in interest rates due to unconventional monetary policy surprises to show that changes in cash-out and other borrowing are roughly offsetting. The elasticity of new household borrowing with respect to mortgage rates is low and varies little with the borrower’s outstanding mortgage rate. Our results suggest that the cash-out refinance channel of unconventional monetary policy is weak and not path dependent. (JEL E43, E52, G21, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 100 US retirement plans and a representative UK panel, I document the impact of auto-enrollment (AE) on retirement savings at different horizons. I replicate the impact of AE on participation and contributions in the short run (at 12 months), but I show that these gains are attenuated over the medium run (at 36 months). At this longer horizon, the average savings increases are modest, though AE significantly lowers inequality in savings. To assess AE’s lifetime impact, I estimate a life cycle consumption-savings model that can fit the observed patterns with a switching cost of approximately $250, smaller than previous estimates.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A college degree offers a pathway to economic mobility for low-income students. Using a multisite randomized controlled trial combined with administrative and survey data, we demonstrate that intensive advising during high school and college significantly increases bachelor’s degree attainment among lower-income students. We leverage unique data on preadvising college preferences and causal forest methods to show that these gains are primarily driven by improvements in initial enrollment quality. Our results suggest that strategies targeting college choice may be a more effective and efficient means of increasing degree attainment than those focused solely on affordability.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study neighborhood choice using a novel research design that contrasts the move rate of homeowners who receive a new different-race neighbor immediately next-door versus slightly farther away on the same block. This approach isolates a component of preferences directly attributable to neighbors’ identities. Both Black and White homeowners are more likely to move after receiving a new different-race neighbor. Findings are robust to additional controls (e.g., income) and alternative research designs. We find evidence of heterogeneity in responses, especially associated with housing density, which has implications for understanding contemporary neighborhood racial change and prospects for maintaining stable, integrated neighborhoods.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a two-country model in which currency and bond markets are populated by different investor clienteles, and segmentation is partly overcome by arbitrageurs with limited capital. Risk premia in our model are time-varying, connected across markets, and consistent with the empirical violations of uncovered interest parity and expectations hypothesis. Through risk premia, large-scale bond purchases lower domestic and foreign bond yields and depreciate the currency, and short-rate cuts lower foreign yields, with smaller effects than bond purchases. Currency returns are disconnected from long-maturity bond returns, and yet the currency market is instrumental in transmitting bond demand shocks across countries.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a bottom-up approach to estimate the slope of the primitive form of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, which features marginal cost as the real activity variable. Using quarterly micro data on prices, costs, and output, we estimate dynamic pass-through regressions that identify the slope as a function of primitive parameters. We find a high slope for the cost-based Phillips curve, which contrasts with the low estimates of the conventional output gap–based formulation found in the literature. We reconcile by showing that the output elasticity of marginal cost is low, at least during moderate inflation periods (e.g., pre-pandemic). (JEL C51, E12, E23, E31, E32, L60)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether the quality of managers can affect public service provision in the context of public health. Using novel data from public hospitals in Chile, we show how the introduction of a competitive recruitment system and better pay for public hospital CEOs reduced hospital mortality by 8 percent. The effect is not explained by a change in patient composition. We find that the policy changed the pool of CEOs by displacing doctors with no management training in favor of CEOs who had studied management. Productivity improvements were driven by hospitals that recruited higher quality CEOs. (JEL D24, G34, I11, I18, J45, M54, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent expansion in the availability of longitudinal and granular panel data has led to a significant increase in the adoption of dynamic panel data (DPD) models in empirical Operations Management (OM) research. To explore this trend, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of empirical OM studies published from 2012 to 2024 in four leading OM journals. Our findings reveal a marked rise in the utilization of DPD models in recent years, with 49 out of 66 (74.2%) reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024. Despite this growing adoption, the estimation of DPD models presents notable methodological challenges compared to standard panel fixed‐effects models, creating barriers to their wider use in empirical OM research. Our simulation shows that the widely used least‐squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator can be significantly biased when estimating DPD models. Variations in methodological choices can lead to differing results and conclusions, raising concerns about the rigor of current practices. To address these issues, we provide a technical review of recent estimation methods for DPD models, highlighting their underlying assumptions and initial conditions. Among these, we recommend the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for its flexibility and less restrictive assumptions, which have contributed to its popularity across various research fields. However, the application of GMM requires a careful, iterative process, which many OM researchers may not be familiar with. To support the effective use of GMM in DPD models in empirical OM research, we propose a practical framework that guides researchers through this process and demonstrates its practical use through real‐world data from supply base management. This framework aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy of estimating DPD models, facilitating more robust empirical research in the field of OM.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: AdGazer: Improving Contextual Advertising with Theory-Informed Machine Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contextual advertising involves matching features of ads to features of the media context where they appear. We propose AdGazer, a new machine learning procedure to support contextual advertising. It comprises a theoretical framework organizing highand low-level features of ads and contexts, feature engineering models grounded in this framework, an XGBoost model predicting ad and brand attention, and an algorithm optimally assigning ads to contexts. AdGazer includes a Multimodal Large Language Model to extract high-level topics predicting the ad-context match. Our research uses a unique eye-tracking database containing 3531 digital display ads and their contexts, and aggregate ad and brand gaze times. We compare AdGazer’s predictive performance to two feature learning models, VGG16 and ResNet50. AdGazer predicts highly accurately with hold-out correlations of 0.83 for ad gaze and 0.80 for brand gaze, outperforming both feature learning models and generalizing better to out-of-distribution ads. Context features jointly contributed at least 33% to predicted ad gaze and about 20% to predicted brand gaze, good news for managers practicing or considering contextual advertising. We demonstrate that the theory-informed AdGazer effectively matches ads to advertising vehicles and their contexts, optimizing ad gaze more than current practice and alternatives like text-based and native contextual advertising.</content>

    <title>From kurtas to crop tops: A theory of postliminal self‐transformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research theorizespostliminal self‐transformation, the process by which consumers adapt to new status positions following major life transitions. Prior consumer research emphasizes liminality—the “betwixt and between” ambiguous phase— but overlooks what happens after liminality as individuals attempt to fit in. Drawing on qualitative data regarding young Indian women migrants to metropolitan corporate contexts, we reveal that transformation does not end with liminality but unfolds through a reflexive and effortful postliminal process. Women strategically use consumption—particularly of clothing and accessories—to bridge self‐discrepancies, mitigate exclusion, and gradually internalize their new professional identities. This stagewise progression moves from observation and mimicry to embodied transformation and identity mastery, often under constraints of patriarchy, class, and gender expectations. Contrasting with traditional (Western) models of adulthood that emphasize settling down, the women's postliminal adaptation is emancipatory and nonlinear, updating scripts for marking adulthood. By theorizing this postliminal adaptation, we challenge assumptions of instantaneous reincorporation, extending understanding of identity work. Our framework advances consumer psychology by showing how consumption facilitates ongoing self‐reconstruction in dynamic and inequitable social hierarchies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effect of reporting regulation on private firms' bank credit and its economic consequences. I exploit the Spanish institutional setting, which provides a unique combination of confidential loan data and regulatory features that generate quasi‐exogenous variation in reporting regulation. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that firms subject to incremental reporting regulation obtain more bank credit primarily through cash flow–based lending, term loans, and long‐term debt, without higher interest rates. These findings are explained by stronger banking competition and greater reliance on financial statement data. However, firms do not expand their net financial position, as bank credit substitutes for other liabilities, and exhibit weaker performance consistent with the costs of reporting regulation. This evidence from a different setting offers new insights into how reporting regulation influences credit contracting for private firms and strengthens the empirical basis for policy‐making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how academic entrepreneurs refine business ideas in response to external critique and how these responses relate to performance. We develop a framework that links feedback (critique), business‐idea changes (pivots), and performance, and test it using detailed data on external stakeholder feedback, changes to the business idea's core and periphery, and commercialization outcomes in 316 academic‐led teams. We find that academic entrepreneurs frequently modify their business idea's core in response to negative feedback, and that core changes—rather than peripheral ones—are positively associated with commercialization. Challenging the idea that all entrepreneurs are inertial, we find that academic entrepreneurs both actively embrace and benefit from changes to the business idea's core. By tracing the feedback‐response dynamics of business idea components, our study adds granularity to research on pivoting.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face a choice between reworking the core of a business idea and making changes to its periphery. Analyzing 316 academic‐led teams seeking to commercialize technologies using the Lean Startup Method, we find that academic‐led teams frequently change their idea's core in response to negative feedback—and that only core changes, rather than peripheral changes, are linked to improved commercialization outcomes. Overall, the results show the effectiveness of the Lean Startup Method and demonstrate that focusing feedback on the core of the business idea is an effective way to provide feedback to academic entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The difference between corporate bond yields at issuance and in secondary markets, the “issuance premium,” spikes in bad times, raising firms’ capital costs. Using new bond-level data and high-frequency variation in bond supply and demand, I estimate a model of primary markets with imperfectly elastic investors, endogenous bond supply, and underwriter frictions that quantifies drivers of issuance premiums. I find underwriters’ favoritism toward investors increases issuance premiums’ levels and cyclical variation. On the other hand, relatively elastic investors allow primary markets to absorb large bond issuances. My findings inform policies targeted at bond issuance markets. (JEL G23, E44, G32, E52)</content>

    <title>Balancing Power in Decentralized Governance: Quadratic Voting and Information Aggregation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In decentralized governance, quadratic voting (QV)—where the cost of acquiring voting power is convex—optimally aggregates voter preferences, outperforming simpler linear voting (LV) mechanisms when voters have complete information. But what if they do not? We show that uncertainty not only breaks QV optimality but can also cause it to underperform LV. Intuitively, this is because cost convexity can disincentivize better-informed voters from adequately conveying their private information. The optimal mechanism varies with the distribution of stakes and information among voters, implying that QV’s known advantages in preference aggregation do not readily extend to common-value information aggregation settings.This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on the Digital Finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08469 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a data-driven newsvendor problem, where one has access to past demand data and the associated feature information. We solve the problem by estimating the target conditional quantile function using a deep neural network (DNN). The remarkable representational power of DNNs allows our framework to incorporate or approximate various extant data-driven models. We provide theoretical guarantees in terms of excess risk bounds for the DNN solution characterized by the network structure and sample size in a nonasymptotic manner, which justify the applicability of DNNs in relevant contexts. Specifically, the convergence rate of the excess risk bound with respect to the sample size increases in the smoothness of the target quantile function but decreases in the dimension of feature variables. This rate can be further accelerated when the target function possesses a composite structure. In particular, our theoretical framework can be extended to accommodate data-dependent scenarios, where the data-generating process could be time-dependent but not necessarily identical over time. Building on our theoretical results, we provide further managerial insights and practical guidance through simulation studies. Finally, we apply the DNN method to a real-world data set obtained from a food supermarket. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that (1) the DNN method consistently outperforms alternatives across a wide range of cost parameters, and (2) it exhibits good performance when the sample size is either very large or relatively limited.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2021-04295]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Project: Data-Driven Operations Analytics Methods]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Peking University; the General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grant 15305523]; and the Research Fund of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [Grant P0048718].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03157 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media video sponsorship, where sponsors partner with content creators to promote their brands, has become increasingly popular. Leveraging rich data on sponsored and nonsponsored videos on Facebook, we introduce two metrics, Content Similarity and Audience Closeness, to help sponsors find effective creator-sponsor matches. Content Similarity captures the thematic alignment between a creator’s content and a sponsor’s brand, whereas Audience Closeness measures how closely aligned a creator’s and sponsor’s audiences are within a social media network. We find that both metrics significantly increase video viewership, but their effects vary over time. Audience Closeness generates more immediate, short-term engagement, whereas Content Similarity drives sustained, long-term engagement. We additionally examine how congruency metrics can complement other sponsorship strategies, including partnering with more established creators, forming new partnerships, and managing the sponsor’s visibility within content. Our findings suggest that Content Similarity can mitigate the negative effects of frequent sponsor appearances and enhance viewer engagement, even in repetitive partnerships. Moreover, we find that Audience Closeness is particularly beneficial for larger, more established creators, whereas Content Similarity is less sensitive to the size of a creator’s following. Finally, we demonstrate how intermediary platforms can adopt these metrics to reduce information asymmetry and improve creator-sponsor matching, especially for long-tail creators and smaller brands.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01192 .</content>

    <title>Systematic Mispricing of Speculative Stocks and the Cross-Sectional Risk-Return Trade-off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the cross-section of returns from the perspective of a benchmark model that only includes systematic mispricing factors. In contrast to conclusions from standard benchmark models, we recover robust positive risk-return relations for many cross-sectional risk, distress, and friction proxies. Our findings are consistent with systematic mispricing that primarily affects speculative stocks and predominantly results in overpricing, predicting lower returns. Hence, failing to control for exposure to systematic mispricing can bias tests of risk-return trade-offs for anomalies with one speculative leg (e.g., risky, distressed, or high-friction stocks) and one nonspeculative leg. Overall, our study offers novel economic insight for this subset of anomalies, indicating that a positive risk-return trade-off can be resurrected after purging out the systematic mispricing component. The evidence suggests that a small shift in perspective generates a substantially different interpretation of the same data.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08815 .</content>

    <title>Embracing a Multipolar World: Management and Organization Scholars and Varieties of Socialism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the evolution to a multipolar economic world during the past three decades, management and organization scholars around the world still largely employ a capitalist view from the United States as the normal state, with scholars analysing other economic contexts as some variation of such capitalism. Despite the fact that over 43 percent of the world’s population lives in nations whose constitutions say the nation is socialist, management and organization scholars appear frozen in time, tied to a historical period when there was largely only one dominant economic model. OurPointis that when communities (nations or individual groups) pursue other economic forms, scholars need to consider that contextual setting, including the socialism, rather than simply assume a typical United States capitalist context as the foundation for research. We identify, define, and illustrate four varieties of socialism in thisPoint. In turn, we then demonstrate how scholars’ understanding of the specific domain of entrepreneurship can be enriched if the socialism of the given context is addressed rather than capitalism assumed. Management and organization scholarship around the world should, moving forward, reflect the dynamics of each unique context, including the respective economic system in that given context, rather than continue to reinforce a United States epistemological hegemony.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Neurodiversity—an umbrella term encompassing a range of neurocognitive developmental conditions such as autism‐spectrum conditions, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, and Tourette syndrome)—recognizes neurological differences as natural variations of the human brain. As management scholars increasingly explore this dimension of diversity, both researchers and practitioners are gaining a deeper understanding of the valuable contributions neurodivergent human capital can bring to the modern workplace. In this article, which serves as a primer for the special issue on neurodiversity and human resource management (HRM), we present a systematic review of the neurodiversity literature organized by employee lifecycle stage. The review synthesizes the most comprehensive practices at the intersection of neurodiversity and HRM. We then introduce the 13 articles featured in the special issue by positioning them within broader trends that emerged from our review. Moreover, we show how each article advances scholarship and practice in neurodiversity and HRM. We conclude by drawing on insights from both the review and the special issue contributions to offer recommendations for future research and practice that center on fostering more inclusive and effective HRM systems for neurodivergent individuals.</content>

    <title>Launch support: Managing complementor bottlenecks in the disruptive innovation of small satellites</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of large‐rocket providers' support for small‐satellite manufacturers before the emergence of small rockets, we examine how disruptors to an incumbent ecosystem gain support from complementors of the incumbent technology. Our analyses illuminate the incumbent complementors' adjustment costs arising from cospecialization with specific incumbent technology designs and resource dependency on major incumbent technology customers. These adjustment costs disincentivize incumbent complementors from supporting the disruptors. In addition, we demonstrate that strategies adopted by the disruptors, such as technological standardization and forward integration, help mitigate these adjustment costs and incentivize incumbent complementors to support the disruptive innovation.Managerial SummarySmall satellites represent a disruptive innovation that significantly reduces the time and cost of satellite production and launch. Despite the large number of small satellites launched today, initially, they were viewed as “second‐class launch citizens,” with incumbent large‐rocket companies resisting launching them. This paper examines how small‐satellite manufacturers overcame this resistance before their dedicated small‐satellite ecosystem was established. We identify the adjustment costs that caused resistance from large‐rocket companies and examine two specific strategies implemented by disruptors—technological standardization and forward integration—to mitigate these costs and gain support from large‐rocket companies.</content>

    <title>Performance feedback and change in R&amp;amp;D alliance portfolio breadth: The moderating role of economic conditions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how firm performance feedback and economic conditions (upturns and downturns) impact changes in the breadth of partner types within a firm's R&amp;D alliance portfolio (R&amp;D AP breadth). We theorize that economic conditions moderate firms' motivation to change R&amp;D AP breadth in response to social and historical performance‐aspiration discrepancies, and shape whether they respond more strongly to social or historical aspirations. Using cross‐industry data on Swiss firms (1999–2020), we find that firms performing below social aspiration are more likely to expand R&amp;D AP breadth during downturns but less likely to do so during upturns. Performance below historical aspiration shows no significant effect once economic conditions are considered.Managerial SummaryWe examine how firms adjust their range of business partners in response to past performance and economic conditions. Analyzing Swiss firms from 1999 to 2020, we find that firms strategically adjust the number of partnership types in response to economic climates. During tough economic times, firms tend to broaden their R&amp;D partnership types when they fall short of peer performance benchmarks. They tend not to do so in prosperous periods under similar performance conditions. We found no consistent effects when performance is benchmarked against the firm's history. These insights help managers strategically navigate alliances under fluctuating economic conditions and underscore the importance of peer‐relative performance benchmarks.</content>

    <title>Permanent Capital Losses After Banking Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the mechanisms driving bank losses across historical banking crises in 46 economies and the effectiveness of policy interventions in restoring bank capitalization. We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations. Early liquidity interventions can avert banking crises, but only under specific conditions. Once large bank equity declines have occurred, policy responses have historically failed to prevent persistent undercapitalization in the banking sector.</content>

    <title>Republican Support and Economic Hardship: The Enduring Effects Of the Opioid Epidemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we establish a causal connection between two of the most salient social developments in the United States over the past decades: the opioid epidemic and the political realignment between the Republican and Democratic parties. Drawing on unsealed records from litigation against Purdue Pharma, we uncover rich geographic variation in the marketing of prescription opioids that serves as a quasi-exogenous source of exposure to the epidemic. We use this variation to document significant increases in drug-related mortality and greater reliance on public transfer programs. This induced economic hardship led to substantial changes in the political landscape of the communities most affected by the opioid epidemic. We estimate that from the mid-2000s to 2022, exposure to the opioid epidemic continuously increased the Republican vote share in House, presidential, and gubernatorial elections. By the 2022 House elections, a one-standard-deviation increase in our measure of exposure led to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the Republican vote share. From 2012 until 2022, this increase in the House vote share translated into Republicans winning additional seats.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: PRODUCT RECALL CONTAGION in the SUPPLY CHAIN</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Following a manufacturer’s large product recall, its supplier’s shareholders may perceive uncertain future demand for the supplier’s products and react punitively, causing a drop in the supplier’s stock return—i.e., a contagion (or negative spillover). Moreover, shareholders’ information asymmetry may cause them to “screen” the supplier’s information cues to determine the supplier’s extent of demand uncertainty. The ideal screen is the supplier’s proportion of sales revenue from the recalling manufacturer. However, not all suppliers disclose this information. Therefore, we propose that shareholders use a two-stage screening. The first screen is whether the supplier demonstrates transparency by voluntarily disclosing information about its customer portfolio. The second screen—available only to the subset of suppliers that disclose customer information—is the supplier’s sales revenue from the recalling manufacturer. We used a sample of 896 U.S. public manufacturer-supplier dyads impacted by 27 large manufacturer recalls. An event study followed by cross-sectional regressions provides evidence of contagion. In addition, it reveals that the supplier’s voluntary disclosure of customer information mitigates contagion, whereas revenue dependence aggravates it. Contextual (i.e., recall) variables also impact contagion. Our research study contributes to the supply-chain contagion literature, screening theory, and customer information disclosure literature. The findings inform supplier firm managers that their prior customer-related disclosures and the contextual variables can moderate contagion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In competitive markets, companies often lack access to their rivals’ sales, costs, and strategies. Can they still learn to make optimal decisions? In a new study, Li and Mehrotra show that the answer is yes. Their research demonstrates that even without competitor data, firms can adaptively learn to make near-optimal choices using only their own operational information. More strikingly, when all players follow such self-driven learning, the entire market converges to a Nash equilibrium—the stable state predicted by economic theory—without explicit coordination. The study establishes theoretical guarantees for both convergence rates and regret performance and illustrates the framework in inventory management and dynamic pricing settings. These findings provide a foundation for data-driven decision making in competitive and uncertain environments and offer insights into how markets naturally self-organize.</content>

    <title>On Generalization and Regularization via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has gained prominence in operations research and machine learning as a powerful method for achieving solutions with favorable out-of-sample performance. Two compelling explanations for its success are the generalization bounds derived from Wasserstein DRO and its equivalence to regularization schemes commonly used in machine learning. However, existing results on generalization bounds and regularization equivalence are largely limited to settings where the Wasserstein ball is of a specific type, and the decision criterion takes certain forms of expected functions. In this paper, we show that generalization bounds and regularization equivalence can be obtained in a significantly broader setting, where the Wasserstein ball is of a general type and the decision criterion accommodates any form, including general risk measures. This not only addresses important machine learning and operations management applications but also expands to general decision-theoretical frameworks previously unaddressed by Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a by-product, we show that Wasserstein DRO coincides with the recent max-sliced Wasserstein DRO for any decision criterion under affine decision rules, resulting in both being efficiently solvable as convex programs via our general regularization results. These general assurances provide a strong foundation for expanding the application of Wasserstein DRO across diverse domains of data-driven decision problems.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12371476 and 71921001] and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2023-05829].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03895 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Do Purchase Preconditions Increase Purchase Intention? the Role of External Reference Points</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently advertise price promotions with purchase preconditions (i.e., minimum spending). This research provides a novel perspective for evaluating preconditions: treating them as external reference points (ERPs) that override consumers’ internal reference points (IRPs) and thus alter perceived discount magnitude. Specifically, consumers evaluate a discount without a precondition by comparing it with an IRP based on past experiences. Conversely, a discount with a precondition creates a new, salient benchmark (ERP) against which the discount is more likely to be evaluated. Due to this change in reference point, a precondition resets the consumer’s discount magnitude calculus, influencing their intentions to shop at the store. This can create dominance violations in which restricted discounts are preferred to their unrestricted counterparts, contingent on whether the precondition is below or above the IRP. The influence of a precondition as an ERP on discount magnitude perceptions is attenuated when the IRP is highly accessible in memory, or when the discount magnitude is already explicit in relative (e.g., percentage) terms. Additionally, similar effects can be produced with a product category restriction equivalent in value to the precondition, and the effect of adding a precondition is attenuated when the equivalent value reference is already present.</content>

    <title>Middle Managers’ Regulation of the Emotions of Others in Strategy Implementation: A Process Perspective</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article develops a process model of how middle managers regulate the negative emotions of their team members to support strategy implementation. Based on a 9‐month ethnographic study in a public broadcasting company, we examine how managers navigate emotionally charged resistance to top‐down strategic themes during meetings. While prior research emphasizes individual techniques, we show that emotion regulation of others (ERO) unfolds as a sequenced process involving three interconnected phases: understanding emotional status, interpersonal tuning, and encouraging reappraisal. Our findings highlight that emotional influence is not achieved through isolated tactics, but through temporally coordinated and relationally attuned practices. In doing so, the study reconciles the tension between validating negative emotions and enabling emotional change. It advances research on middle managers by theorizing how they navigate emotional resistance in real time and contributes to ERO theory by demonstrating the importance of temporal coordination between validation and reappraisal.</content>

    <title>Why is Bribing Doctors an Excusable Crime? The Normalization of Professional Corruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professional corruption is a pervasive issue with significant societal consequences. This study investigates the normalization of professional corruption by examining bribery among physicians in Chinese hospitals, where informal payments, or ‘red packets’, from patients were often reported despite being illegal. Drawing on a qualitative case study, we develop a process model comprising four mutually reinforcing building blocks: organizational arrangements, which capture distinct features of professional campuses that enable corruption; constrained supervision, which weakens institutional governance and limits accountability to clients; rationalizations, through which professionals justify informal payments by emphasizing professional expertise and social respect while downplaying the social trusteeship value; and socialization, which operates through a combination of structural assurance and backstage cocoons that desensitize professionals to the ethical implications of bribery. Furthermore, we highlight the role of cultural resonance in linking corrupt practices to traditional gift‐giving customs, thereby legitimating informal payments in professional contexts. Our findings contribute to understanding how organizational factors and cultural traditions jointly enable corruption, offering insights applicable to other professional organizations while emphasizing important boundary conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how firms attempt to preempt activism before it mobilizes into an active threat. Employing a difference‐in‐differences design, we examine the quasi‐exogenous enactments of laws that prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti‐SLAPP laws) in the United States. We find evidence suggesting that in response to the enactment of anti‐SLAPP laws, firms self‐regulate through enhancing their institutional corporate social performance (institutional CSP). This response is more pronounced in firms with greater firm‐specific activism risk, as evidenced by greater media coverage on firms' social irresponsibility. These findings suggest that, in response to activism risk, firms attempt to keep activists from targeting them by preemptively engaging in self‐regulatory improvement in their institutional CSP. The preemptive action we document extends research on stakeholder activism.Managerial SummaryBy analyzing how US firms respond to the enactment of laws that prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti‐SLAPP laws), we find that in anticipation of activist attacks, firms enhance their institutional corporate social performance (institutional CSP). This proactive response is more evident in firms facing a heightened risk of activism, such as those with substantial media exposure for socially irresponsible outcomes. We suggest the looming institutional risk of activism prompts firms to engage in self‐regulatory adaptation in enhancing their institutional CSP, hopefully mitigating the risk of being targeted by stakeholder activists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Planogram Design and Display Fees on Retail Category Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of planogram design (i.e., placement of products on shelves) and display fees (i.e., fees manufacturers pay retailers for prime shelf space) on a retailer’s category management strategy and interactions with national brand manufacturers (NBMs). We consider a game-theoretic model with one retailer and multiple NBMs. Each NBM offers one product. In addition, the retailer has the option to introduce a store brand (SB) product. If the retailer decides to introduce its SB, it needs to drop one of the national brand (NB) products from its assortment because it has limited shelf space. The retailer’s planogram has one prime shelf space and multiple nonprime shelf spaces. The prime shelf space has a demand-stimulating impact. The NBMs determine their wholesale prices and how much they are willing to pay for the prime shelf space. The retailer makes SB introduction and planogram decisions. It also sets the quantities for each product in its assortment, resulting in market-clearing retail prices. Our analysis leads to three key findings: First, the presence of a prime shelf space may not only prevent the retailer from introducing its SB but also lead to sizable changes in the retail and wholesale prices in the category. For example, an extensive numerical study reveals that receiving the prime shelf space increases an NB product’s retail price by 5.48%. The average increase in the same product’s wholesale price is 2.52%, as the prospect of charging a higher wholesale price incentivizes its manufacturer to pay a display fee for securing the prime shelf space. Second, there are cases in which the retailer uses SB introduction as a strategic lever to intensify the competition for the prime shelf space and thereby increase its revenue from display fees. Third, despite being an additional expense, display fees can increase the NBMs’ profits by allowing them to influence the retailer’s assortment and planogram decisions in their favor. We discuss the implications of these findings for managers and researchers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Generative AI Announcements on Suppliers: Evidence from the Stock Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) technology is revolutionizing firm operations and supply chain management, profoundly influencing firms within the GenAI supply chain network. While a few emerging studies have explored the impact of GenAI initiatives on firms’ stock performance, it remains unclear how such disruptive technology initiatives affect the stock price movements of their supply chain partners. This paper empirically investigates the impact of firms’ GenAI initiatives on the abnormal stock returns of their suppliers by analyzing data on news, supply chain relationships, and daily stock prices. The analysis indicates that, on average, a firm’s GenAI announcement leads to a positive abnormal return of 0.27% for its suppliers on the announcement day, with additional evidence of sustained long-term value creation. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that this spillover effect is more pronounced among suppliers with higher R&amp;D intensity, stronger sales growth, closer geographic proximity to the focal firm, and operations in less competitive industries. Furthermore, the positive abnormal returns are significantly greater when the GenAI initiative pertains to product innovation rather than process improvement. Our findings have important implications for supply chain stakeholders navigating the adoption of GenAI technologies.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Surgeon Daily Workload and Its Implications for Operating Room Scheduling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many service systems, an individual server’s workload can have a substantial impact on service time and quality. Such effects are particularly important in healthcare systems which often operate under resource and time constraints. In much of the literature, this effect of workload has been primarily considered at the system and instantaneous level rather than the individual and cumulative level. In this study, we investigate this relationship in the context of cardiac surgery, i.e., how surgery duration and patient outcomes are affected by the individual surgeon’s daily workload. Using a detailed data set of more than 5,600 cardiac operations in a large hospital, we quantify how individual surgeon daily workload (the number of operations performed by the focal surgeon) affects surgery duration and patient outcomes. To handle the endogeneity of surgeon daily workload, we construct instrumental variables using operational factors of the cardiac surgery department, including the regular surgery schedule of surgeons. We find that high daily workload for the focal surgeon is associated with longer surgery duration as well as post-surgery length-of-stay in the ICU and hospital. These results highlight the potential negative impact of high individual surgeon workload. We develop a surgical scheduling model that incorporates the estimated impact of surgeon daily workload. We solve the model by mixed-integer quadratic programming and show that our proposed schedule can substantially reduce total OR time and post-surgery length-of-stay. Our results suggest that hospitals should take into account the effects of individual surgeon daily workload when managing their ORs. Specifically, they can substantially improve patient flow and patient outcomes by smoothing individual surgeon’s workload across days.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, earnings call slide decks (hereafter, earnings decks) have become increasingly common in the earnings announcements of public firms. In this paper, I examine the characteristics of earnings decks and the determinants of firms’ use of them. More importantly, I study their capital market roles. While I fail to find evidence that earnings decks on average offer information incremental to traditional disclosures, such as press releases and conference calls, they significantly reduce users’ information processing time. My analyses reveal three mechanisms that contribute to this acceleration: inclusion of visuals (e.g., charts and tables), summarization of key information, and release prior to earnings calls. Overall, this study documents a novel aspect of earnings announcements and highlights the role of multimedia elements in reducing information processing costs of corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72402110, 72442014].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04956 .</content>

    <title>A Framework for Selecting Action Portfolios with Incomplete and Action-Dependent Scenario Probabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies pursue their goals by selecting and implementing a combination or portfolio of actions that consume resources. The extent to which these actions help attain the companies’ objectives is often contingent on whether a given future scenario is realized. In this paper, we present a model-based framework for supporting the selection of a portfolio of actions that is robust across different scenarios while accounting for the impacts that the actions may have on the probabilities of these scenarios. For the purposes of this framework, we develop a new portfolio decision analytic model and algorithms to help generate recommendations for selecting actions, when (i) the actions’ scenario- and objective-specific impacts, as well as preferences between the objectives are incompletely specified, and (ii) information regarding scenario probabilities is incomplete and may depend on the selected actions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive report on the application of the framework in a high-impact case on supporting the strategy process at the payments unit of Nordea Bank Abp, the largest retail bank in the Nordic countries. Based on retrospective interviews with the participants in this strategy process, three kinds of impacts from the use of our framework could be identified: (i) actions related to implementing the decision recommendations and strengthening the required capabilities, (ii) information to help evaluate these decision recommendations as the future unfolded, and (iii) behavioral changes in terms of elevating the level of strategic discussions.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Liikesivistysrahasto [Grant 16-9442].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05383 .</content>

    <title>Deciphering the PCAOB Inspection Process: Evidence and Predictive Insights from Public Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Little is known about how the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) selects audits for inspections. We exploit public data that track PCAOB searches of issuer Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and the trial transcripts of United States of America v. David Middendorf to provide the first large-sample evidence on confidential PCAOB monitoring activities. We initially validate that PCAOB searches spike during actual inspections of triennially inspected auditors and for a list of KPMG audits inspected in 2016. Importantly, we find that PCAOB searches vary predictably with ongoing audit-flagged events, client corporate events, and client characteristics, and these screening and inspection activities extend beyond enforcement actions. Using KPMG data, we introduce a PCAOB inspection prediction model for Big 4 clients based solely on public data, with predicted incidence closely aligning with actual inspections. One implication of our study is that, perhaps to mitigate political costs, the PCAOB relies overly on conspicuous trigger events that already signal low audit quality (i.e., restatements, auditor changes, chief financial officer turnovers, bankruptcies, and SEC comment letters), raising the question of how its risk-based inspection program is designed to improve overall audit quality or minimize large audit failures. In addition, although model-inferred PCAOB inspections are not associated with future restatements, broader PCAOB monitoring activities, as proxied by search intensity, exhibit modest predictive power. Overall, our study provides a more nuanced understanding of the PCAOB inspection program and the factors driving its revealed preferences.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University, Baruch College, and the Penn State Smeal College of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08084 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this crowdsourced initiative, 57 independent analysts used the same longitudinal dataset to address four major empirical questions in international business. For all four research questions, different analysts obtained substantial estimates in opposite directions, meaning that they could have drawn any conclusion at all had they conducted the project alone. Aggregating across the results obtained by different analysts pointed to an overall answer for two of the four research questions, although for one of the two questions, the evidence was more suggestive than conclusive. That said, the variability in results was not simply random, and could in some cases be meaningfully explained. Choices regarding how to operationalize variables played an important role in determining the empirical results, and expert analysts were more likely to report large positive effects. Rather than exhibiting a bias to confirm their pre-existing beliefs, analysts appeared to rationally update their beliefs considering the evidence. Overall, these findings empirically demonstrate the role of subjective researcher choices in shaping results in international business research yet also show that it is still possible to draw meaningful conclusions in science. We advocate for an open science of international business in which the consequences of subjective analytic choices are rendered as transparent as possible.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploiting changes in countries’ competition laws, we find that competition increases firms’ propensity to use zero leverage (ZL). We test the financial-flexibility, financial-constraint, and quiet-life explanations for this result, concluding that desire for flexibility is the one most likely. The relation between competition and ZL strengthens with cash-flow volatility, which supports the flexibility motive. Adoption of ZL by firms is accompanied by increases in payouts, so it is unlikely that ZL adopters are constrained. Proxies for governance have no effect on the relation between competition and ZL, suggesting that desire for a quiet life is not the explanation either.</content>

    <title>Do Earnings Announcements Affect Employee Spending? Evidence from Transaction Data*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging micro‐level data on individual employees’ bank and credit card transactions, we examine the impact of earnings announcement (EA) news on employee spending. Utilizing an event study methodology, we find strong evidence that EA news elicits significant reactions in employee spending. These reactions are stronger for employees located in the firm's headquarters state, with longer tenure, possessing investment experience, or earning higher wages, consistent with these employees being more likely to attend to their firm's EAs. The reactions are also stronger for the fourth fiscal quarter than interim quarters, suggesting that year‐end results garner greater employee attention. Furthermore, consistent with media facilitating employee processing of EA news, the reactions are stronger for EAs covered by a larger number of news articles. Finally, in line with the notion that EAs contain information about employees’ future cash flows, we find that EA news predicts changes in employee wages and that employees with higher past wage‐to‐EA news sensitivity exhibit stronger spending reactions. Overall, our findings provide evidence of the role of financial reporting in employees’ spending decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To decide about retirement, employees assess and react to their work environment, including age‐inclusive HR practices. Age‐inclusive HR practices ensure equal access to key HR functions for all employees—regardless of age, for example, training and development for all age groups, unlike age‐specific HR practices, which target older workers exclusively, for example, development opportunities for older workers. In this study, we uncover why age‐inclusive HR practices are effective in retaining older employees. Using a conservation of resources theory approach, we explain that age‐inclusive HR practices can enhance older employees' employability (i.e., perceived ability to realize job opportunities within and between employers) and reduce their job insecurity (i.e., perceived risk of a decline in job quality, including working conditions, career prospects, and salary). Employability, conversely, weakens employees' retirement intentions, while job insecurity strengthens these intentions. We use a three‐wave design with 758 older employees and path analysis, controlling for age‐specific HR practices, to demonstrate the unique effect of age‐inclusive HR practices on employees' retirement intentions. Findings showed that age‐inclusive HR practices (beyond age‐specific HR practices) were indirectly linked to employees' retirement intentions via job insecurity but not employability, emphasizing their importance for resource loss prevention as a means for older employees' retention.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study moves beyond the traditional atomistic view of firms engaged in alliance agreements. By integrating current research on internal organizational design with research on interfirm collaboration, we investigate the implications of the organizational design of parent firms for the design and governance of technology partnerships. More specifically, we propose that in a research and development (R&amp;D) alliance between a client firm and an R&amp;D firm, the client firm’s internal organizational structure in R&amp;D plays an important role in alliance design and governance. Centralized firms are better able to integrate knowledge in the organization compared with decentralized firms, and hence, we theorize that they will design their technology partnerships for greater knowledge access. Empirical findings from alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry offer support for our predictions: firms with centralized R&amp;D decision making are more likely to capture intellectual property rights. Further, these firms tend to engage in alliances with broader vertical and horizontal scope and greater technological interdependence in order to access, recombine, and distribute knowledge. This study extends research on alliance design and governance by underscoring the important influence of a partner firm’s organizational structure.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce partial law invariance, generalizing law invariance, and probabilistic sophistication widely used in decision theory, as well as statistical and financial applications. Partial law invariance may be interpreted as law invariance restricted to events for which there is no model uncertainty, reflecting practical situations in decision theory and financial risk management. We fully characterize partially law-invariant coherent risk measures via a novel representation formula. Strong partial law invariance is defined to bridge the gap between the above characterization and the classic representation formula of Kusuoka. We propose a few classes of new risk measures, including partially law-invariant versions of the expected shortfall and the entropic risk measures, and illustrate their applications in risk assessment under different types of uncertainty. We provide a tractable optimization formula for computing a class of partially law-invariant coherent risk measures and give a numerical example.This paper was accepted by Aurélien Baillon, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grants CRC-2022-00141, RGPIN-2020-04356, and RGPIN-2024-03728].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06518 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document effects of the opioid epidemic on the migration and output of skilled workers who drive corporate innovation. Exploiting geographic variation in opioid abuse unrelated to economic conditions and using both patent and home sales-based measures, we show that inventors and research labs exit affected areas. This displacement is accompanied by declines in the quantity and value of patents of approximately 7% and $10.6 million per year, respectively. Declines in school quality, safety, and other amenities drive the out-migration. Because displaced workers are unlikely to abuse opioids, our results represent spillover effects of opioid abuse on nonusers.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: The project received funding from the University of Kansas’s General Research Fund and Troesh Center Research Grants from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article introduces the special issue on occupations and memory in organizations. To foster increasing collaboration from scholars from both fields, we offer a general argument connecting memory and occupations on two levels. At the societal level, we show how memory experts, such as historians, archivists, and museologists, have played a fundamental role in the development of modernity and the emergence of our contemporary historical consciousness. At the occupational level, we argue that occupations are transgenerational communities maintained through various practices and technologies of memory whose legitimacy and professional status increasingly depend on their ability to cultivate both practical and historical memory. We further explore three related topics covered by the papers from this special issue: expert and memory work, occupational and mnemonic communities, and professional and mnemonic projects. At the end, we identify three promising themes for future research: the negotiation of boundaries and resources among communities; the interaction between technology, expertise, and memory; and the occupational ethics and responsibility towards past actions and memories.</content>
