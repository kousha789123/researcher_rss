    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Management of Self-Renewable Resource in a Production-Inventory System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a production-inventory system in which production relies on a self-renewable natural resource. The resource regenerates at a rate that depends on its current stock as well as random environmental factors. In each period, the firm decides on the production quantity, facing stochastic demand and limited resource. This type of system is common in industries such as fishing and logging. We model the resource’s self-renewal using a generating function and formulate the production optimization problem as a dynamic program. We find that because of the renewable nature of the resource, the optimal stock level does not necessarily increase with the available resource quantity, and could become higher than the optimal stock level for a benchmark system where resource is unlimited. In a special case with deterministic demand and environment, we show that it could be optimal to halt production even with zero inventory left, in order to preserve the growth of resource. On the other hand, it could also be optimal to raise the inventory level to be higher than demand, when overpopulation becomes an issue. Moreover, a higher market price, which stems from adverse environmental conditions and signals lower future yields, can incentivize the firm to reduce production and conserve resources for future growth. In a deterministic environment where the inventory is fully perishable, we analytically characterize the long-run dynamics of the resource quantity. In particular, sustainable production is more achievable for low-margin products, and a myopic production firm does not necessarily deplete the resource. We conduct numerical experiments using real-world salmon population data to test the robustness of our findings in general systems with stochastic environment and non-perishable products. The results show that ignoring either the resource constraint or the self-renewal dynamics, could lead to high operational costs and undermine resource sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study dynamic contracts that incentivize an agent to exert effort to increase the arrival rate of a Poisson breakthrough, where both the effort cost and the effort level at any time are the agent’s private information. Optimally, the principal offers a menu of contracts, each tailored to an agent type (with a different effort cost), specifying an initial payment, a contract deadline, and a payment-upon-arrival process over time. We first fully characterize the optimal contract menu in a two-type setting, where the agent is either a good (low-cost) or bad (high-cost) type. Specifically, the principal should hire the agent only if the breakthrough revenue exceeds a threshold. Above this threshold, if the bad agent’s cost is higher than another threshold, it is optimal to motivate only the good type to exert effort. The principal offers the good type a simple linear contract in which the payment-upon-arrival declines linearly over time until the deadline, whereas the bad type receives an initial payment and leaves immediately. The linear contract provides just enough incentive for the good agent to work. If the bad agent’s cost falls below the threshold, it becomes optimal to also motivate the bad agent to work using a linear contract, whereas offering the good agent a one-switch contract. The one-switch contract extends the linear form by allowing the payment-upon-arrival to take a single downward jump at a specific time before the deadline. The optimal contract structure extends to multiple-type cases, in which the one-switch contract becomes a multiple-switch contract. To obtain the entire menu of contracts, one only needs to solve a sequence of linear optimization problems together with a bisectional line-search, which is fast to compute and easy to interpret and implement.Funding: F.

    <title>How and When Are High-Frequency Stock Returns Predictable?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the predictability of ultrahigh-frequency stock returns and durations to relevant price, volume, and transaction events using machine learning methods. We find that contrary to low-frequency and long-horizon returns, where predictability is rare and inconsistent, predictability in high-frequency returns and durations is large, systematic, and pervasive over short horizons. We identify the relevant predictors constructed from trades and quotes data, and we examine what determines the variation in predictability across the stock’s own characteristics and market environments. Next, we compute how the predictability improves with the timeliness of the data on a scale of milliseconds and conversely degrades with delays, providing a valuation of each millisecond gained. Finally, we simulate the impact of getting an (imperfect) peek at the incoming order flow, a look-ahead ability that is often attributed to the fastest high-frequency traders, in terms of improving the predictability of the returns and durations.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02435 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Free-Riding Product Returns to Drive Profits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Returning products has become standard practice for consumers, and a significant "pain point" for retailers. The authors contend that returns can be harnessed to increase profits. This requires retailers to manage the interweaving dynamics of product returns and purchase. The strategy is to co-manage a virtuous cycle whereby current returns increase future purchases, and a vicious cycle whereby current returns increase future returns. Marketing executes the strategy. It generates purchases. The returns that follow impose a direct cost due to the vicious cycle. However, the virtuous cycle of returns can offset this, enabling the retailer to “free-ride” returns by optimizing its marketing. The approach follows the Decision Support System (DSS) paradigm by combining a conceptual model, a statistical model, data, and optimization. A core construct is a stock variable tracking consumers’ memory of return experiences. This drives both the virtuous and vicious cycles. The authors optimize marketing spend accounting for Return Stock. The best results are when dynamics are included in both the statistical and optimization models. Results suggests managers should avoid strict return policies aimed at eliminating returns. Instead, they should design policies that optimally balance the long-term benefits and costs of returns.</content>

    <title>Rigidity in Crisis: The Impact of OHSAS 18001 Certification on Production Repurposing During COVID‐19</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is important for firms to repurpose production responsively during a crisis such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, to seize the market opportunity and create social value. However, occupational health and safety (OHS) can also be a concern in a crisis, and adherence to OHS management systems can undermine a firm's responsiveness in repurposing decision making. We adopt the “capability–rigidity” lens to construct a connection between OHS management standards (i.e., OHSAS 18001) and firms’ adaptation responsiveness. After sampling 734 listed Chinese manufacturing firms, our match‐based analysis reveals that firms certified with OHSAS 18001 were less responsive during COVID‐19 in terms of production repurposing than those without the certification. Yet, certain experience, namely, prepandemic manufacturing of related products, experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and being geographically located close to firms that produced medical supplies, could attenuate this effect. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of and adding to the literature on safety management, certified management standards, and organizational adaptation and learning.</content>

    <title>Social Pricing of Luxury Products in a Distribution Channel</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok has greatly facilitated social interactions among individuals, and thus their product consumption has become more visible to their peers. This enhanced visibility influences consumers' purchase decisions of luxury products because it affects social value derived from conspicuous consumption of these products. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to study the impact of such social technologies on social pricing of a manufacturer and a retailer offering luxury products along a distribution channel. Consumers exhibit conspicuous consumption preferences and are grouped intosnobsandconformists: Snobs value product exclusivity, while conformists desire product popularity. We derive the following interesting results. First, a better social technology that leads to higher visibility for conspicuous consumption can either raise or lower the wholesale price and retail price. Second, the manufacturer may gain (lose) while the retailer may lose (gain) under a better social technology; that is, the manufacturer's and retailer's preferences regarding the level of a social technology may not be aligned. Third, the advancement of a social technology may harm consumer surplus. Lastly, we consider several model extensions to validate our findings in broader contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms often encourage existing customers to recruit new customers. In this paper, we analytically study the customer referrals in a two‐period newsvendor model, where the demand generated by referrals increases in the previous sales. In this framework, we establish the structural results for the optimal inventory level, as well as evaluate the value of referral programs. We find that the customer referrals are more attractive for firms selling nonperishable products than for those selling perishable products. Overall, this study underscores the operational value of customer referrals, particularly for firms selling nonperishable products.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Tokenization on Ride‐Hailing Blockchain Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid development of blockchain has inspired many traditional centralized intermediaries to transform their transaction models, especially for the peer‐to‐peer market. Lately, the token‐based (blockchain) system (with cryptocurrency) is gaining popularity. However, little is known about the (comparative) performance of different operating types. In this study, we build an analytical framework to find the optimal strategies for the token‐based and non‐token‐based blockchain (as a special application scenario) platforms and derive the essential model properties and characteristics. We analytically show how the optimal mining bonus depends on the fraction of reserved tokens sold to customers and on the price‐to‐sales ratio. Furthermore, we obtain several actionable findings for choosing suitable platform types under different scenarios. The shift from the non‐token‐based platform to the token‐based platform may yield greater social welfare unless the non‐token‐based system operates with a much larger ride price, which we show to be unrealistic for the considered Beijing case through numerical studies. Moreover, we find that the matching probability for the token‐based platform is predominantly higher than that for the non‐token‐based one. Besides, government interventions may encourage a path toward a fair consensus mechanism or a high decentralization level in order to enhance social welfare. One unanticipated finding is that a higher decentralization level may lead to a lower mining capacity shortage and so to a more efficient system, indicating that the combination of blockchain and the sharing economy has much potential.</content>

    <title>Industry 4.0 Technologies: Empirical Impacts and Decision Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industry 4.0 technologies have been regarded as powerful means to enhance a firm's competitiveness in the Internet of Things environment. However, implementing Industry 4.0 technologies calls for considerable capital expenditure and might interrupt normal production in the short term. This study conducts an empirical analysis of the impact of investing in Industry 4.0 technologies based on a sample of 563 investment announcements of publicly listed firms on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2018. Using the event study method, we find empirical evidence that these investment announcements lead to positive stock market reactions and improved financial performance. In particular, we empirically evaluate firms’ short‐ and long‐term stock prices and financial measures by considering the type of investments (i.e., digital or physical investments), whether the investment is product‐oriented or manufacturing process‐oriented, and whether the technologies are applied within a firm or across the supply chain. Our empirical findings hold true when a firm's strategic decision is accounted for and remain robust through various tests. Furthermore, we propose a decision framework for firms to balance the tradeoff between short‐term disruption and long‐term benefits resulting from an investment in Industry 4.0. Specifically, we develop a two‐period model and investigate when and to what extent a firm should invest in Industry 4.0 technologies. Empirical and modeling analyses provide managerial insights for firms that grapple with the net benefit of investment in Industry 4.0.</content>

    <title>Minimax Optimality in Contextual Dynamic Pricing with General Valuation Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study contextual dynamic pricing, where a decision maker posts personalized prices based on observable contexts and receives binary purchase feedback indicating whether the customer’s valuation exceeds the price. Each valuation is modeled as an unknown latent function of the context, corrupted by independent and identically distributed market noise from an unknown distribution. Relying only on Lipschitz continuity of the noise distribution and bounded valuations, we propose a minimax-optimal algorithm. To accommodate the unknown distribution, our method discretizes the relevant noise range to form a finite set of candidate prices, then applies layered data partitioning to obtain confidence bounds substantially tighter than those derived via the elliptical potential lemma. A key advantage is that estimation bias in the valuation function cancels when comparing upper confidence bounds, eliminating the need to know the Lipschitz constant. The framework extends beyond linear models to general function classes through offline regression oracles. Our regret analysis depends solely on the oracle’s estimation error, typically governed by the statistical complexity of the class. These techniques yield a regret upper bound matching the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we refine these guarantees under additional structures—for example, linear valuation models, second-order smoothness, sparsity, and known noise distribution or observable valuations—and compare our bounds and assumptions with prior dynamic-pricing methods. Finally, numerical experiments corroborate the theory and show clear improvements over benchmark methods.Funding: X.

    <title>Data-Pooling Reinforcement Learning for Preventative Healthcare Intervention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging needs of tailored intervention for heterogeneous populations in preventative healthcare applications, we consider a multistage, dynamic decision-making problem in the online setting with unknown model parameters. To deal with the pervasive issue of small sample size in parameter estimation, we develop a novel data-pooling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that adaptively pools historical data, with three main innovations: (i) the weight of pooling is directly tied to the performance of the decision (measured by regret) as opposed to estimation accuracy in conventional methods; (ii) no parametric assumptions are needed between historical and current data; and (iii) requiring data-sharing only via aggregate statistics, as opposed to patient-level data. Our data-pooling algorithm framework unifies a variety of RL algorithms, and we establish a theoretical performance guarantee that quantifies the regret bound reduction from our adaptive pooling design compared with benchmarks. We substantiate the theoretical development with extensive empirical experiments via a case study in the context of postdischarge intervention to prevent unplanned readmissions, generating practical insights into healthcare management. Our algorithm enables organizations to leverage public data or published studies for patient management and supports policymakers in promoting aggregate data sharing to enhance population health outcomes.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using exogenous variation in the timing and geographic location of U.S. Congressional elections, we find that the probability of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement actions against foreign firms increases significantly preceding senatorial elections, spiking more than 21%, with no commensurate increase for globally operating domestically headquartered firms in these same senators’ states. Using hand-collected case-level data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), we observe that these pre-election cases tend to be weaker overall and that they are brought significantly more often against foreign firms that operate in less-important industries in the senator’s state and when they have a smaller overall U.S. presence. This spike in foreign firm targeting is accompanied by a significant spike in traditional and social media coverage coupled with sharply negative sentiment. Furthermore, these enforcement actions and media spikes are associated with electoral consequences, specifically greater vote shares and better poll results for enforcement-state senators. The FCPA enforcement actions have real impacts on firms. These include a 10% reduction in market value after enforcement actions against foreign firms and a significant decrease in credit ratings.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00476 .</content>

    <title>Escaping Product Market Rivalry Through Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study leverages advanced text-analysis techniques to investigate how increased product market rivalry, induced by Chinese import competition, affects innovation among incumbent U.S. firms in the electronic and electrical appliance industry. We measure the similarity between the product descriptions of U.S. firms and those of Chinese importers, thus capturing firm-level competitive pressure. Employing a continuous difference-in-differences framework, we compare innovation outcomes of U.S. firms more directly competing with Chinese importers to those facing lower competitive pressure over a five-year period before and after initial Chinese market entry. We find that incumbent U.S. firms significantly increase their quality-weighted patent production, create more new-product patents, and strategically diversify into new technological and business segments when confronted with heightened competition. Our findings highlight the role of import-driven rivalry in stimulating strategic innovation and illustrate how text-based similarity measures can effectively quantify firm-level competition, providing novel methodological tools for strategy scholars.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Funding: B.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly connects observed portfolio choices to correlations of individual income shocks with an aggregate shock (or, equivalently, with stock market returns). The share of nonparticipating individuals displaying a positive correlation, and therefore a negative hedging demand for stocks, is above 79% in both our samples. Furthermore, correlations predict nonparticipation to the equity market, also out-of-sample and for the same individual over time.

    <title>Make Social Media Social Again: How Platform Interoperability Can Fix Social Media and Future‐Proof Democracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This essay argues that social media document (rather than fuel) the decline ofpoliticaldemocracy while helping reviveorganizationaldemocracy, including through ‘decentralized autonomous organizations’ (DAOs). Yet, despite giving everyone a voice and the ability to organize across borders, social media could over‐concentrate power if, in the future, a few large but siloed platforms ended up shrinking viewpoint diversity – the oxygen of democracy. How can we curb corporate platform concentration without dulling democracy? Due to trade‐offs in platform design, no single service can deliver free speech, free usage, and safe usage simultaneously. Fortunately, this ‘trilemma’ can be transcended at the industry level with an interoperability mandate that fosters user multihoming and lets various platforms provide different bundles of democratic benefits. Email works across service providers, and so can social media. Interoperability thus represents a viable answer based on six advantages: practical feasibility; competition on merit; faster complementor innovation; jurisdictional flexibility; unlocking network effects between, rather than just within platforms; and alignment with democratic values. Platform interoperability can make social media social again and future‐proof democracy. This proposal is a clarion call for blaming the Internet a little less for democracy’s problems and instead leveraging its infrastructure strategically to address them.</content>

    <title>Shaping the System Through Turbulence: Strategic Leadership and the Micro‐Foundations of Ecosystem Orchestration in Times of Disruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While research on ecosystems and their orchestration has grown rapidly, we still know little about how individual strategic leaders may mobilize ecosystemic action in times of disruption. This article addresses this gap by drawing on an in‐depth case study of the Antwerp Square Mile, the world’s oldest and most renowned diamond trading ecosystem. Analysing how leading individuals orchestrated the Mile’s response to lab‐grown diamonds, we identify three key pathways through which individuals can steer ecosystems amid disruptive innovation: acognitive pathway, in which leaders shape the system’s collective interpretations of the disruption as well as itself; asocial pathway, in which leaders sustain and reconfigure changing relational ties across ecosystem participants; and anemotional pathway, in which leaders manage shifting affective dynamics to maintain engagement and resilience. By highlighting how ecosystems can be meaningfully guided through disruption by everyday acts of interpretation, connection, and affective interaction, this study contributes an important micro‐foundational angle to existing macro‐level explanations in times of systemic turbulence – shedding light on the small, to comprehend the grand.</content>

    <title>Informed Trade of Earnings Announcements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how market participants trade on private information about firm fundamentals using the largest known case of informed trade of earnings announcements. From 2011 to 2015, a cartel of sophisticated traders illegally obtained early access to and traded on over 1,000 firm earnings announcements. Using this setting, I identify the information in earnings announcements that these market participants found most price relevant. The informed traders preferred announcements with larger earnings and sales surprises relative to forecasts, quantitative managerial guidance, and more extreme news sentiment. Despite their perfect foresight, the traders performed, perhaps surprisingly, poorly relative to hypothetical trading strategies based on comparable foresight. Frictions that limited their performance include price impact, risk aversion, and information processing costs. The trading performance of these informed traders implies that information about firm fundamentals explains little of the cross‐sectional variation in earnings announcement returns, even for sophisticated market participants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between CEOs’ preferences for environmental protection (“nature‐loving preferences”) and corporate environmental actions. Drawing on social ecology research, I develop a proxy for CEOs’ nature‐loving preferences based on their childhood exposure to greenspace and validate it using their positive discussions of nature during earnings conference calls. Findings show a significant positive association between CEOs’ nature‐loving preferences and their firms’ participation in Clean Development Mechanism projects. This effect remains robust after addressing firm–CEO matching and omitted variable concerns. Cross‐sectional tests reveal stronger effects when local environmental demands are high and when CEOs have greater decision‐making power. Further analyses suggest that these CEOs are associated with greater corporate carbon reduction, while market reactions to their appointments remain neutral. The study highlights the link between CEOs’ personal environmental preferences and firms’ environmental actions, offering new insights into individual‐level factors behind corporate social responsibility.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Brave New Telemedicine: Cognitive Bias and the Anticoagulant Gap in Atrial Fibrillation Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Telemedicine has transformed healthcare delivery, yet its impact on the quality and consistency of clinical decision-making remains underexplored in operations management. While heralded for efficiency and access, it is unclear whether virtual care systematically alters adherence to clinical practice guidelines. This study investigates whether the mode of care, telemedicine versus in-person, affects clinicians’ guideline-recommended prescribing of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, where treatment adherence is crucial to prevent severe outcomes. Using electronic medical record data from 16,603 patient encounters at a major academic health system in the United States (2020–2023), we employ a two-way fixed-effects linear probability model to compare prescribing patterns. We find that telemedicine visits are associated with a 5.2-percentage-point lower probability of guideline-recommended anticoagulant prescription than in-person visits. The gap is driven by clinicians with historically lower adherence; top-quartile clinicians show no difference across modalities, exhibitingbehavioral robustness(adherence resilient to modality). We propose that telemedicine’s leaner information channel heightens perceived uncertainty, activating cognitive biases: for some clinicians, telemedicine exacerbatesambiguity aversionandomission bias, favoring inaction in virtual settings. Linking service design to variation in professional judgment, we show how operational context moderates decision quality. Practically, healthcare organizations should not treat telemedicine as a simple substitute for in-person care; they should implement targeted operational interventions, such as enhanced decision support and training on cognitive biases, to maintain high standards of care so efficiency and access gains do not come at the cost of adherence. In a supplementary analysis, we estimate that, at the population level in the United States, a 5.2-percentage-point telemedicine-related gap in anticoagulant prescribing could result in more than 150 preventable strokes and roughly $50 million in avoidable lifetime costs annually for each newly diagnosed cohort, underscoring its substantial clinical and economic significance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Practical Guide to Endogeneity Correction Using Copulas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Causal inference is of central interest in many empirical applications, yet often challenging because of the presence of endogenous regressors. The classical approach to the problem requires using instrumental variables that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction. In recent research, instrument-free copula methods have been increasingly used to handle endogenous regressors. This article aims to provide a practical guide for how to handle endogeneity using copulas. The authors give an overview of copula endogeneity correction, outlining its theoretical rationales, advantages, and limitations for empirical research. They also discuss recent advances that enhance the understanding, applicability, and robustness of copula correction, and address implementation aspects of copula correction such as constructing copula control functions and handling higher-order terms of endogenous regressors. To facilitate the appropriate usage of copula correction in order to realize its full potential, the authors detail a process of checking data requirements and identification assumptions to determine when and how to use copula correction methods, and illustrate its usage using empirical examples.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit an episode of plausibly random debt discharge due to the loss of paperwork for thousands of defaulted borrowers to examine the effects of private student debt relief on borrower outcomes. We find that borrowers who receive debt relief (treated) experience declines in debt balances and delinquency rates onotheraccounts, and increases in mobility and income relative to those who bear the costs of default like wage garnishment and collections (control). Borrowers in both groups contribute to our findings through different mechanisms. While our estimates may not directly apply to blanket student loan forgiveness, they speak to the benefits of forgiveness in reducing the consequences of debt burden for distressed borrowers.</content>

    <title>Losing Control? The Two‐Decade Decline in Loan Covenant Violations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The annual proportion of U.S. public firms that reported a financial covenant violation fell roughly 70% between 1997 and 2019. To understand this trend, we develop an estimable model of covenant design that depends on the ability to differentiate between distressed and nondistressed borrowers and the relative costs associated with screening incorrectly. We find that the drop in violations is best explained by an increased willingness to forgo early detection of distressed borrowers in exchange for fewer inconsequential violations, which we attribute largely to a shift in the composition of public borrowers and partly to heightened investor sentiment during the 2010s.</content>

    <title>Seeing Expectations as “Opportunities”: Interpretive Philosophy and the Origins of “Opportunity” Perceptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop arguments against the objective opportunity construct and argue that “opportunities” should be understood as wholly and fundamentally subjective. We define and elaborate “opportunities” as expectations attainable only through intervening action, with requisite propositional attitudes of both desirability and feasibility. These revisions imply a fundamental shift in the foundations of entrepreneurship theory. Such a shift prompts us to rethink the nature of entrepreneurial cognition, allows us to elaborate the myriad—indeed endless—ways “opportunities” can manifest, and engenders clearer and more specific theorizing on the processual navigation of reality’s unfolding vis-à-vis “opportunity” expectations and consequent entrepreneurial plans.</content>

    <title>The technological uniqueness paradox</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish a new paradox surrounding technological uniqueness, defined as the degree to which a firm's patented technology portfolio differs from its competitors. On the one hand, technological uniqueness acts as a barrier to incoming technology spillovers and impedes firm performance. On the other hand, technological uniqueness reduces outgoing technology spillovers and contributes to a strategic resource that is more costly to imitate. We empirically examine these competing arguments and find evidence that the strategic resource argument dominates for average firms in the data with more technologically unique firms performing better. At the same time, we show that pursuing technological uniqueness is costly, as unique firms indeed benefit less from incoming technology spillovers, are harder to understand by equity analysts and have higher costs of equity capital.Managerial SummaryWe establish empirically for a sample of public corporations that being technologically unique pays off‐companies with distinctive patent portfolios outperform their peers on average. This uniqueness creates a competitive moat that is difficult for rivals to overcome. But there is a catch: the same uniqueness that protects a company also isolates it. When technology is so different from conventional wisdom, it becomes difficult for outsiders to understand, then a contrarian company will also struggle to learn from others' breakthroughs. We empirically document a double penalty: contrarian companies benefit less from innovations by peer firms and equity analysts can't easily evaluate the business, driving up the cost of capital.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extract information about future economic conditions from firms’ cross-border merger and acquisition announcements, and show it predicts changes in relative economic growth rates and foreign exchange rate returns. We find the predictability is driven by the acquisition decisions of domestic firms, which signal turning points in local economic growth. The findings are motivated by a simple model of exchange rate determination with heterogeneous expectations and support the theorized relationship between foreign exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals. The results provide new tools for policy makers seeking to predict economic activity and offer global investors a novel source of portfolio diversification.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In January 2021, a group of stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges experienced sudden price increases, which, coupled with high short interest, led to short squeezes. We find that discussions on social media fueled the association between retail trading and subsequent stock returns. Options market activity and securities lending constraints also played a central role. Using unique data from social media platforms, we provide a comprehensive account of these short squeezes. We find that they significantly impeded market quality for the stocks at issue and their competitors. Thus, the interplay between social media and retail traders may have adverse consequences for market quality and efficiency.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02887 .</content>

    <title>Magic Will Happen if You Gather Us in One Room: Gender Homophily and Women-Only Networking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although networking is critical for career advancement, prior research has primarily examined women’s networking in comparison to men’s, often concluding that it plays a less instrumental role due to gendered organizational structures. Women-only networking events are organized to enable women to leverage gender homophily for mutual support and career advancement. However, the mechanisms of gender homophily in women’s networking are not straightforward. Drawing on observations of women-only networking events, interviews, and secondary data, we identify three meanings women attach to homophilic networking (status-driven, instrumental, and expressive) and show how these meanings shape networking behaviors. In networking contexts characterized by “enforced homophily,” where support is offered under the guise of benevolence, women are more aware of these differences in meanings, which prevent them from leveraging the potential benefits of networking with other women. In contexts characterized by “agentic homophily,” the relevance of these differences is less salient, empowering women to challenge, rather than reproduce, gendered organizational structures. Our research extends the understanding of gender homophily as a multifaceted force that is dynamically shaped by the context and interactions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Growing discussions of impact investing and stakeholder capitalism have increased interest in measuring companies' social impact. We conceptualize corporate social impact as the welfare loss that would be caused by a firm's exit. To illustrate, we quantify the social impacts of 74 firms in 12 industries using a new survey measuring consumer and worker substitution patterns combined with models of product and labor markets. We find that consumer surplus is the primary component of social impact, suggesting that consumer impacts deserve more attention from impact investors. Existing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and social impact ratings are essentially unrelated to our economically grounded measures.</content>

    <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Predicting FDA’s 510(k) Medical Device Recalls Using Device Citation Relationships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than 90% of medical devices in the United States are approved through the Food and Drug Administration’s 510(k) pathway, primarily based on demonstrating the equivalence of new devices (known as applicant devices) to previously cleared devices (known as predicate devices). However, safety concerns are raised as applicant devices cleared this way may be more prone to recalls that relate to substantial patient harm and financial strain on the healthcare system. In response, this work introduces a data-driven information technology approach to predict medical device recalls, aiming to alleviate these safety concerns by augmenting human decision making. The approach primarily uses the characteristics of the network formed by predicate device citation relationships (predicate network). It uses deep learning to tackle three design challenges: learning the predicate network structure, capturing the temporal patterns of predicate network characteristics, and accounting for dependencies across the predicate citation history. Based on 45,398 medical devices cleared between 2003 and 2020, the approach substantially improves recall prediction accuracy and timeliness compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. The improved recall-prediction performance and insights into performance variations across device categories provide opportunities to preemptively react to potential recalls and improve the safety of devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway.</content>

    <title>Service Work as Lived Experience: A Problematizing Review</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between employee burnout and growing recruitment challenges, a systemic crisis confronts the service industry. One reason lies in the scope of received human resource management (HRM) approaches, which often emphasize organizational performance metrics at the expense of the emotional, social, and material experiences of doing frontline service work. As a result, many HRM solutions do not fully address the experiential realities that shape employee wellbeing, engagement, and retention. This paper calls for a stronger focus on how service workers interpret, inhabit, and appropriate the everyday realities of their work. Through a problematizing review, we build on an emerging, inter‐disciplinary body of research that builds rich, grounded accounts of frontline service experiences. We propose a new experience‐centric framework—a set of theoretical tools and a conceptual vocabulary that put forth a more holistic understanding of the lived experience of service work. We conclude by offering a set of recommendations that can help foster more resilient, engaged, and people‐centered service environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of a human resource management (HRM) system or subsystem, such as a compensation system, hinges on its implementation—yet the microfoundations of this process remain underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. Study 1 surveyed middle managers and employees in six organizations to examine their attributions of problems with compensation systems and their perceptions of compensation system effectiveness. We found that both groups identified design problems; managers emphasized administrative problems, whereas employees focused on implementation problems. These differing attributions shaped their views of compensation system effectiveness. To further unpack the challenges middle managers face, we analyzed data from Study 2, a 6‐year long in‐depth case study, exploring how and why middle managers varied in their implementation strategies. We found that middle manager identification with the system and their perceived agency explained their implementation strategies, ranging from championing to compliance, and from appropriation to resignation. Together, the studies reveal persistent tensions between consistency and adaptation in HRM implementation. To address these tension, we introduce the concept ofinternal flexibility—the capacity of middle managers to adjust formal HRM practices during the implementation process to align them with their work unit's needs—as a critical yet underexplored dimension of HRM effectiveness.</content>

    <title>Disambiguating the Effects of Shareholder Activism on Corporate Director Careers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines shareholder activism and its consequences for corporate directors’ career trajectories. We begin by highlighting that the inherent ambiguity surrounding activist interventions implies variation in director careers beyond an overall negative effect. Specifically, we posit and test the notion that the director labor market will differentiate between financially based versus socially based shareholder unrest, with the latter having a stronger negative effect based on (1) its greater information value above and beyond what is already knowable about the firm, and (2) heightened recognition of the need for directors to balance financial performance pressures with responsiveness to evolving environmental, social, and governance concerns. Empirically, we analyze U.S. shareholder activism events between 2014 and 2018, and using Coarsened Exact Matching combined with a Difference-in-Differences approach, we find evidence consistent with our disambiguation perspective on shareholder activism. Our theoretical and empirical analyses also further disambiguate whether director exits reflect market or/and director preferences, and we find evidence for both. We conclude by discussing how our theoretical perspective and empirical findings contribute to research on shareholder activism, director labor markets, and corporate governance.</content>

    <title>Axioms for Automated Market Makers: A Mathematical Framework in FinTech and Decentralized Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts that have emerged as a cornerstone of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), replacing traditional intermediaries for trading digital assets. However, the underlying principles, risks, and economic properties of these novel markets require a rigorous mathematical foundation. In “Axioms for automated market makers: A mathematical framework in fintech and decentralized finance,” Maxim Bichuch and Zachary Feinstein construct such a foundation. The authors propose a set of intuitive axioms for the utility functions that govern AMMs. From this framework, they characterize the resulting swap and pricing properties and define a novel measure of price impact to quantify and compare transaction costs across different AMM designs. The work also addresses practical issues by proposing a new fee structure that ensures indifference to transaction splitting and analyzing the critical risk of divergence loss for liquidity providers, offering a comprehensive guide for designing and analyzing these new financial technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we develop and test theory onwhether,when, andhowthe prevalence of women in firms’ top management influences workplace safety – an important ‘do no harm’ dimension of corporate social performance. Consistent with our theorizing, we find that there is a negative relationship between the prevalence of women executives in firms’ top management and workplace safety violations. We show that the relationship is amplified by board gender diversity and ownership by institutional investors who advocate for greater gender diversity in firms’ upper echelons. We also show that the relationship is partially mediated by employee workload. Our findings have important implications for the management literature on the gender profile of firms’ top management and for the workplace safety literature.</content>

    <title>What Drives Investors' Portfolio Choices? Separating Risk Preferences from Frictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of risk preferences and frictions in portfolio choice using variation in 401(k) default options. Patterns of active choice in response to different default funds imply that, absent participation frictions, 94% of investors prefer holding stocks, with an equity share of retirement wealth declining with age—patterns markedly different from observed allocations. We use this quasi‐experiment to estimate a life‐cycle model and find a relative risk aversion of 2.5, elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) of 0.25, and $160 portfolio adjustment cost. The results suggest that low levels of stock market participation in retirement accounts are due to participation frictions rather than nonstandard preferences such as loss aversion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study develops a practice-relevant theory explaining why some information technology (IT) unavailability incidents lead to severe and prolonged organizational consequences. By redefining IT unavailability as unmet demand for IT resources rather than simple system downtime, the paper shows how disruptions cascade through information capacity deficits and business capacity deficits, ultimately impairing critical services, affecting clients, and damaging organizational reputation. An analysis of 28 real-world IT unavailability incidents reveals that three reinforcing feedback loops (IT inertia, information inertia, and business inertia) can intensify service disruption, delay recovery, and amplify downstream impacts.</content>

    <title>Asymmetric Learning Effects of Chief Information Officer Outside Board Appointments: Cybersecurity Implications for Sender and Receiver Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cybersecurity failures are increasingly costly, prompting companies to recruit CIOs from other firms to their boards. This study examines whether there any impacts on a firms’ cybersecurity when (a) firms allow their own CIO to serve on an outside board; and (b) when firms appoint a CIO from another company to their own board. Using CIO-firm-year observations, we compare two pathways: (1) receiver firms that appoint an external CIO to their board, and (2) sender firms whose own CIO serves on another company’s board. The findings show asymmetric effects. Receiver firms experience fewer data breaches, suggesting that external CIOs effectively transfer cybersecurity expertise and practices. In contrast, sender firms face higher breach risk, as CIOs who serve externally appear to prioritize educating the recipient firm over acquiring new insights for their home firm. This risk intensifies when the external firm lacks strong cybersecurity practices but is mitigated when the home firm has a dedicated CISO. Conversely, receiver firms benefit most when the sending firm has strong cybersecurity capabilities—or even a past breach—because negative events create valuable lessons. The results offer actionable implications: firms should strategically recruit outside CIOs to improve board-level cyber capabilities and carefully weigh the risks before permitting their own CIOs to serve externally. Policymakers should consider mechanisms that incentivize effective cybersecurity knowledge transfer across board interlocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This exploratory study examines patterns of entrepreneurial engagement across the life course using Group-Based Trajectory Modeling and panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. We identify four distinct career trajectories—never, early-adulthood, mid-adulthood, and career-persistent entrepreneurship—and analyze differences in their timing, duration, and frequency. We then explore how early-life family capital is associated with trajectory membership and how these paths relate to psychological and financial outcomes in middle adulthood. Instead of focusing on single points of entry or exit, this study traces the full arc of entrepreneurial careers—revealing how they unfold, develop, and diverge over the course of individuals’ working lives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does corporate board gender diversity affect supply chain risk management? Board gender diversity can influence supply chain risk management through behavioral and agency-based mechanisms. Female directors’ greater risk aversion, lower overconfidence in the face of uncertainty, and heightened accountability pressures may lead to stronger oversight and risk mitigation efforts in operations, where risks are quantifiable and failures are highly visible. Therefore, we should expect supply chain risk management to increase with increased women representation in corporate boards. We test this prediction leveraging on a reform requiring California firms to increase board gender diversity. We find that the propensity to use purchase obligations, supply contracts designed to mitigate the risk of future price fluctuations and reduce procurement uncertainty, increased for California buyers following the reform. We also find that California buyers increased their geographic supply chain diversification and became more likely to discontinue relationships with high-default risk suppliers after the reform. These changes are larger when female directors are better positioned to influence corporate decisions, contributing to validate board gender diversity as an important channel for operational changes. The takeaway for corporate leaders, policymakers, and shareholders is that board gender diversity can lead to a greater focus on supply chain risk management, which increases profitability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Diagnosing Why Models Fail Under Distribution Shift and What to Do NextPredictive models often perform worse when deployed in a new target setting, but it is rarely clear why. In “Diagnosing Model Performance Under Distribution Shift,” Cai, Namkoong, and Yadlowsky introduce a diagnostic, distribution shift decomposition (DISDE), that attributes the change in performance from the training to target distributions into terms for (i) an increase in harder but previously seen inputs from training, (ii) changes in how outcomes relate to inputs, and (iii) poor performance on new input regions absent from the training data. Applications to employment prediction demonstrate how this decomposition can inform potential modeling improvements, guiding whether to use domain adaptation techniques, adjust model covariates, or collect new samples. Additionally, DISDE is used to help explain why certain domain adaptation methods fail to improve model performance for satellite image classification.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Designing Effective Procurement Mechanisms for Assembly Systems Under Supply UncertaintyIn their paper “Procurement for Assembly Systems Under Supply Uncertainty: Optimal Mechanisms,” Like Bu, Milind Dawande, and Ganesh Janakiraman explore how manufacturers can effectively source components when suppliers face uncertain yields and possess private information about their production costs. Such challenges are common in industries such as electronics and automotive manufacturing, in which a shortage of a single part can halt the entire assembly line. The authors develop an optimal procurement mechanism that helps manufacturers decide how much to source from each supplier and how to structure payments contingent on uncertain delivery quantities when suppliers’ production efforts cannot be directly observed. Their analysis reveals a practical menu-based contract under which each supplier selects terms best suited to its situation and the manufacturer subsequently determines order quantities for each component. The study provides both theoretical insights and actionable guidance for managing complex supply relationships in uncertain environments.</content>

    <title>The Changing Nature of Firm Innovation: Short-Termism and Influential Innovation in U.S. Public Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the link between short-term pressures and technologically significant innovation in U.S. public firms in 1997–2015. Using a market-based measure of short-term pressure, we estimate its relationship with influential and novel patents. We find that firms facing more intense short-term pressures are less likely to patent highly influential or novel innovations. To evaluate whether this relationship is causal, we use changes in ownership styles following financial institution mergers as instruments. Our analysis suggests that changing short-term pressures from investors had a causal impact on firm innovative outcomes; this finding is robust to a wide variety of empirical specifications. While public firms as a whole retained a constant share of highly influential patents, this activity has become more concentrated in fewer firms. This shift does not appear to be fully compensated by an increase in technologically significant patents by nonpublic firms such as venture-capital (VC)-backed start-ups. These findings raise questions about capital markets’ impact on firm R&amp;D strategy and the nature of innovative activities in public firms.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the inaugural Panmure House Prize for Long-term Thinking and Radical Innovation for this research, as well as Matt Marx for facilitating institutional support at Cornell for this research.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mid- and low-level managers play a significant role within the organizational hierarchy, far beyond monitoring. It is often their responsibility to respond to opportunities and threats within their units by adjusting their subordinates’ assignments. Most such managers, however, lack the authority to adapt their subordinates’ wages. Instead, they rely on other, more restrictive incentive schemes. We study the interaction between a front-line manager and worker and characterize the “managerial style” as a function of the players’ relative patience and information.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Funding: D.

    <title>EXPRESS: The No-Hunger Games: How GLP-1 Medication Adoption is Changing Consumer Food Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The authors examine how consumers modify their food purchases after adopting appetite-suppressing GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic and Wegovy. Using survey responses on medication adoption linked to transaction data from a representative U.S. household panel, the authors document the prevalence, motivations, and demographic patterns of GLP-1 adoption. Households with at least one GLP-1 user reduce grocery spending by 5.3% within six months of adoption, with higher-income households reducing spending by 8.2%. While most food categories see spending declines, the largest reductions are concentrated in calorie-dense, processed categories, including a 10.1% decline in savory snacks. In contrast, a small set of categories show directionally positive changes, with yogurt experiencing the largest increase. Results show an 8.0% decline in spending at fast-food chains, coffee shops, and limited-service restaurants. These food demand adjustments persist through the first year of medication use, though with some attenuation after six months. Households discontinuing GLP-1s revert toward their pre-adoption grocery spending and shift toward slightly less healthy grocery baskets compared to their original baseline. These findings highlight the potential for GLP-1 medications to significantly change consumer food demand, a trend with increasingly important implications for the food industry as GLP-1 adoption continues to grow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how the effectiveness of three core marketing-mix instruments—price, assortment, and distribution—evolves over time across brands, categories, and countries, using the Empirics-First approach to generate relevant knowledge. The authors analyze household panel data covering over 16,000 brands in 85 consumer packaged goods categories for on average 10 years across 34 countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. They adopt a rolling-window estimation approach to derive time-varying elasticities, followed by a moderator analysis to identify systematic drivers of change. Averaged across time, brand price elasticity is -.640, assortment elasticity is .311, and distribution elasticity is .213. However, time-invariant averages have limited meaning given that 98.5% of brands exhibit significant evolution in at least one instrument’s elasticity. Substantial heterogeneity in trends emerges, moderated by brand, category, and country factors. The single most important predictor is the brand’s baseline (mean) elasticity. The stronger the elasticity, the larger its downward trend. Brand power and whether the brand is a local brand emerge as other key factors. Consumer purchase frequency and share-of-wallet are stronger category predictors of elasticity trajectories than retailer factors. Findings underscore the need for dynamic, elasticity-based resource allocation in brand management.</content>

    <title>Striking a Political Balance? Political Polarization and Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Affective polarization, a division marked by animosity between members of opposing political groups, has dramatically increased, particularly in the United States. This paper examines the extent to which affective polarization may spill over into organizations and influence strategic outcomes—specifically, corporate innovation. I theorize how politically balanced organizations, that is, those that lack a prevailing political ideology and have workforces that are more evenly divided between opposing political stances, are less innovative due to heightened animosity and reduced collaboration. Furthermore, I propose that the negative relationship between political balance and innovation intensifies at higher levels of partisan animosity in society and political engagement among organizational members. Conversely, I theorize that the relationship weakens when a firm is led by a CEO who does not overtly signal a clear political leaning. I test and find support for these predictions using a novel donation-based index of organizational political balance for 744 publicly traded U.S. companies from 2002 to 2015. This paper highlights the role of political balance as a potential conduit of intrafirm rivalry that hinders innovation. The findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms and conditions through which political polarization may influence organizations and their outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vision communication plays a crucial role in leadership, strategic management, and organizational change. However, current research on vision communication is fragmented, leading to a limited understanding of the topic. To advance this topic, this paper synthesizes the existing literature on the dimensions, theoretical mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes of vision communication, drawing on 150 papers. In particular, we identify four key dimensions of vision communication: vision attributes (e.g., imagery, metaphor), vision content (e.g., emphasis on profits or product quality), vision communication frequency (e.g., infrequent vs. frequent), and non-verbal delivery (e.g., emotional displays, eye gaze). Furthermore, we integrate four theoretical perspectives—motivation-based, identification-based, affect-based, and cognition-based—to explain the effects of vision communication. In essence, vision influences various outcomes by ensuring that employees are motivated and feel confident in their ability to achieve them (i.e., motivation-based), identify with the vision or leadership (i.e., identification-based), experience emotional inspiration or positive affect (i.e., affect-based), or understand the vision (i.e., cognition-based). Based on these mechanisms, we outline four categories of moderating factors that shape their impact (e.g., leader factors, follower factors, leader-follower relationships, and contextual factors). Finally, we outline future research directions to further advance research on vision communication.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Borrowers' use of cashless payments improves their access to capital from FinTech lenders and predicts a lower probability of default. These relationships are stronger for cashless technologies providing more precise information, and for outflows. Cashless payment usage complements other signals of borrower quality. We rationalize these empirical findings using a framework in which borrowers signal their lower likelihood of diverting cash flows through payment technology choice, and screening accuracy is further strengthened by informational complementarities. The informational synergy we uncover provides a rationale for the joint rise of cashless payments and FinTech lending, as well as for open banking.</content>

    <title>Audience Entanglement: How Independent Creative Workers Experience the Pressures of Widespread Appeal on Digital Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creative workers often seek a substantial audience for their work. Our findings reveal that a new struggle begins once they attain one. Existing theory fails to account for how creators conceive of and manage the relationship with their audience once their work has gained widespread appeal. In an inductive study of independent creative workers who use digital platforms to share their work, we discovered that after attaining a substantial audience, creators experienceaudience entanglement:a subjective sense of deep interrelatedness between an individual and the audience for their work such that this relationship becomes a persistent consideration in their approach to creating. This entanglement typically begins asdysfunctional entanglement, characterized by feeling an oppressive dependence on audience reactions, struggling with platform volatility, and experiencing distressing emotions. In this state, creators question the meaning of their work and view platform work as unsustainable. Some creators developentanglement management strategies—distancing themselves from audience input, depersonalizing audience critiques, and distilling their personal standards—that shift them to a state offunctional entanglement, or feeling a balanced dependence on audience reactions, accepting platform volatility, and experiencing uplifting emotions. Functional entanglement allows creators to capture meaning from their audience and to view platform work as sustainable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nature Doesn’t Play Dice, It Plays to WinDecision making under uncertainty can be brittle, often failing when real-world data deviates from training assumptions. This study frames this problem as a game between a decision maker and an adversary, nature, who strategically corrupts the data distribution to create a worst case scenario with the cost of these changes defined by optimal transport theory. The authors establish conditions under which a stable outcome, a Nash equilibrium, exists and provide efficient methods to compute it. A key insight is that nature’s optimal strategy corresponds to generating remarkably deceptive adversarial examples; in an image classification task, this strategy can transform an image of an “8” into a convincing “3.” This work provides a powerful framework for developing more reliable models by understanding and countering worst case data perturbations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Providing inclusive environments has become a primary tenet of modern societies and organizations. The use of gender-inclusive language (GIL) is often considered an instrument that can promote inclusion, yet little is known about its effects on relevant economic behaviors and on gender gaps in the labor market. GIL avoids the masculine “default” (common to many languages) by either explicitly mentioning both masculine and feminine (pro)nouns, or replacing them with nongendered (pro)nouns. Here we study the causal short-run impact of GIL on competitiveness and leadership in the laboratory, with two different language samples—English and German—which differ, among other things, in the extent to which gender is embedded linguistically. We vary GIL in experimental instructions across three treatments ([Formula: see text]): a masculine baseline condition, a condition with feminine and masculine (pro)nouns, and a condition with nongendered (pro)nouns. We find that participants who identify as female and participants who identify as male compete, stand for leadership, and vote on leader candidates similarly across all treatments, in either language. Furthermore, we find no treatment differences in participants’ feelings of inclusion and perceived entitlement. In sum, there is a lack of support for GIL having short-term causal effects on competitive and leadership behavior and inclusion perceptions.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund [Grant SFB F63], UK Research and Innovation [Grant MR/T020253/1], the University of Exeter, and Regensburger Universitätsstiftung Lucia and Dr. Otfried Eberz.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04342 .</content>

    <title>Understanding People’s Preferences for Predictions: People Prioritize Being Right over Minimizing How Wrong They Are in Expectation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work explores the preferences that laypeople exhibit when making and evaluating predictions in the form of point estimates (e.g., the high temperature will be 66°). I propose that people typically have diminishing sensitivity to prediction error: the absolute difference between a prediction and a realized outcome. As a result, people often prioritize “being right,“ focusing on achieving near perfect predictions and placing less emphasis on the magnitude of errors when errors occur. Across 16 studies using varying methods and stimuli, participants exhibited multiple behaviors consistent with diminishing sensitivity to prediction error: (i) predicting the mode of distributions, (ii) restricting predictions to possible outcomes, (iii) reporting decreasing reactions to increasing marginal units of error, and (iv) preferring predictive models built with diminishing sensitivity to error. This behavior diverges from traditional methods of building predictive models and common interpretations of people’s predictions, which often prioritize avoiding large errors and assume that people are predicting the mean. Ultimately, this work not only highlights the discrepancies between our current practices and people’s preferences for predictions but also calls for a more thorough exploration of human objectives before we build models for them to use or make inferences about their beliefs in light of a decision they made.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: I thank the University of Chicago Booth School of Business for financial support.Supplemental Material: Preregistrations, materials, data, code, and supplements are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07257 and at ResearchBox at https://researchbox.org/3130 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Belief change does not always lead to behavior change. This belief–behavior gap has received considerable atention, particularly in the context of misinformation. We expand upon ideas in the literature by offering additional insight derived from research on attitudes. Specifically, we propose that lessons from attitudes research can be applied to the belief–behavior relationship to further understand when belief change will and will not promote behavior change. We discuss the role of attitudes in determining how beliefs shape behavior, the value of measuring and targeting attitudes in research on behavior change, and factors that can influence theattitude–behaviorrelationship as a means to gain insight into thebelief–behaviorrelationship. As part of our review, we also offer recommendations as to how belief‐targeting interventions might be improved to increase their impact on downstream behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the structure of public firm buyouts in a model that features the Berle-Means problem (lack of incentives) and the Grossman-Hart problem (holdout). We find that bootstrapping, debt in excess of funding needs, and upfront fees to bidders are socially optimal and increase buyout premiums. These elements make LBO financing tantamount to a “management contract” arranged by an outside manager to receive cash and incentives to manage a firm—except the cash is funded by excess debt imposed on the firm. Our model also rationalizes why PE firms collect fees from their equity partnerships and directly from target firms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Introduction of online degree programs: A competitive framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Educational services contribute $315.65 billion to the U.S. GDP, with online education representing the fastest-growing segment. This paper examines how operational and market factors influence universities’ decisions to introduce online degree programs. We study the strategic introduction of such programs in a vertically differentiated market, where universities differ in online program rankings (quality) and compete for a diverse student population with varying willingness to pay for perceived quality. Our analysis focuses on a simultaneous market entry scenario, yielding robust insights that also hold under alternative settings–such as when universities are equally ranked or differ in their variable costs of technology. We also examine two additional contexts: (1) a mixed competition setting in which one university operates independently while the other is guided by a social planner, and (2) an incumbent–entrant setting in which a university considers launching an online program when its competitor has already entered the market.Our findings reveal that symmetric market entry–where both universities introduce online programs–is more likely when technology integration costs exceed a certain threshold and student valuation heterogeneity is significant. In contrast, when these costs fall below the threshold, asymmetric equilibria arise in which only one university introduces an online program. When a social planner regulates tuition at the lower-ranked university, it faces tighter constraints on entering the market. However, when the higher-ranked university is subject to tuition regulation, broader market coverage and improved social welfare outcomes are achieved. Additionally, lower-ranked universities can strategically enter by targeting lower-end segments through moderate technology investments and competitive pricing. Yet, the entry of a higher-ranked rival can exert downward pressure on tuition fees for both institutions, promoting a more accessible educational environment. These insights offer strategic guidance for universities navigating quality-based competition and provide policy implications for balancing competitive dynamics with educational equity through regulatory interventions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape operations across industries. Yet its real-world impact reveals a jagged and uneven implementation frontier. To make sense of this emerging landscape, we develop a foundational framework that synthesizes research and practice at the intersection of AI and Operations Management (OM), anchored in three interdependent pillars: (1) AI for OM, (2) OM for AI, and (3) Human–AI Interaction. First, AI for OM analyzes how AI enhances core operational processes, including design, procurement, production, and delivery. Second, OM for AI argues that scaling AI safely and effectively stands to benefit from core OM principles, including workflow design, capacity management, process control, drift detection, and continuous improvement, all of which are central to AI development and deployment. Third, Human–AI Interaction emphasizes the role of trust, incentives, and organizational design in mediating how humans and machines learn from and collaborate with each other. This triadic framework provides a foundation for organizing research on AI and OM and offers practical guidance for integrating AI into business and societal systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a robust, flexible, and easy-to-implement method for estimating the yield curve from treasury securities. Our nonparametric method learns the discount curve in a function space that we motivate by economic principles. We show in an extensive empirical study on U.S. Treasury securities that our method strongly dominates all parametric and nonparametric benchmarks. It achieves substantially smaller out-of-sample yield and pricing errors while being robust to outliers and data selection choices. We attribute the superior performance to the optimal trade-off between flexibility and smoothness, which positions our method as the new standard for yield curve estimation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01401 .</content>

    <title>Social Media Is a Threat for Democracy! A Political Perspective for Analysing and Diminishing Harm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms, once hailed as potential champions of dialogue, have evolved into commodified spaces in which their business models incentivize hate speech, misinformation, polarization, and the political fragmentation of society, benefiting corporate and political elites while eroding democracy. The existing market and technological conceptualizations of social media platforms offer only partial analysis of and solutions to these issues. This paper advances a political perspective grounded in deliberative democracy, arguing that social media companies are political actors responsible for maintaining a well‐functioning public sphere. We argue that transforming social media platforms into true facilitators of democratic discourse requires enhancing theirdeliberative capacity. Beyond the capacities of the public sphere suggested by the market and technology perspectives (1) transparency and accountability and (2) openness and inclusiveness, we propose that fostering deliberative capacity also requires (3) conduciveness to argumentation and (4) consequentiality. We thus contribute to understanding how management theories can explain and address current threats to democracy.</content>

    <title>Modes of Reasoning in Management and Organization Studies: Promises and Perils of Abduction and Induction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Debates about theorizing in management and organization studies have at their core the question of how scholars mobilize different modes of reasoning. The principles ofdeductionandinductionhave long structured methodological discussions. The third way –abduction– derived from Peirce’s conception of ‘inference to the best explanation’, has gained traction in debates about how to generate novel and original theoretical insights. ThisPoint–Counterpointdebate focusses on the promises and perils of abduction vis‐à‐vis induction as modes of reasoning. In theirPoint, Fleming and Oswick propose ‘loosely coupled abduction’ as a mode of reasoning that steers a middle ground between unbounded, ‘creative’ abduction and highly proceduralized, ‘disciplined’ abduction. In theirCounterpoint, Filatotchev et al. accept the creative promise of abduction but warn that consensus‐based plausibility can engender what they call ‘semiotic abduction’, where mechanisms become widely accepted through repetition rather than verification. Building on these contributions, in this introduction to the debate, I situate abduction within the broader landscape of deductive and inductive reasoning in management research, critically evaluate the arguments advanced by thePointandCounterpoint, and propose avenues for future research on the role of abductive reasoning in management and organization studies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of uncertainty shocks on firm‐level economic activity depends on their origin in supply chains. Upstream (downstream) uncertainty from suppliers (customers) is associated with variability over future input (output) prices. Consequently, a real‐option production model with time‐to‐build suggests that only upstream uncertainty suppresses investment, since upstream (downstream) uncertainty affects the shorter (longer) run. Production network data show that upstream uncertainty negatively affects firm‐level outcomes. Conversely, downstream uncertainty affects firm‐level outcomes more weakly but positively. At the macro level, these two uncertainties oppositely predict aggregate growth and asset prices. Overall, downstream uncertainty has an expansionary effect, in contrast to other facets of uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conceptualizing impatience as an emotion, and patience as the regulation of that emotion, offers new insights and opportunities for the study of consumer behavior. While this framework has primarily been applied to impatience for positive events, many real‐life events of interest involve decisions about negative or mixed‐valence events. In this commentary, I explore how impatience and patience play out in these situations, explaining a set of previously disconnected “anomalies” in the literature on intertemporal choice, yielding fresh insights and applications in consumer psychology. Finally, I explore when and how people may want to cultivate (rather than regulate) impatience for gains and losses.</content>

    <title>Can Regulation Restore Authenticity? Evidence from Policies Against Online Review Suppression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Businesses have long sought to shape their online reputations, not only by soliciting positive reviews but also by suppressing negative ones through legal threats. Such practices distort consumer decision-making and undermine trust in digital marketplaces. To address this problem, the U.S. Congress enacted the Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA) in 2016, prohibiting businesses from using contractual clauses or intimidation to silence consumer feedback. Leveraging millions of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, this study provides the first systematic evaluation of the CRFA’s effectiveness. We find that after the law’s enactment, U.S. hotel reviews became longer, more candid, and systematically more negative. Effects were especially strong for less reputable hotels, highly competitive markets, and experienced reviewers, pointing to where suppression had been most prevalent. Supplemental analyses confirm similar patterns using Google Places data and state-level repeals of criminal defamation laws. These findings demonstrate that regulation can effectively restore transparency and authenticity in online review platforms. For policymakers, the results provide concrete evidence that consumer-protection laws can counteract harmful business practices. For managers and platforms, they underscore the value of fostering open feedback ecosystems that promote trust and informed consumer choice.</content>

    <title>Determinants of Employee Victory in Telecommuting Labor Disputes: A Configurational Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid expansion of telecommuting during the COVID‐19 pandemic created novel disputes over remote‐work conditions that existing laws did not clearly regulate. This study investigates the configurational determinants of employee victory in these disputes. Drawing on resource‐based and institutional theories of litigation outcomes, we propose an analytical framework comprising three categories of determinants: employee resources (income, tenure, and legal representation), employer resources (enterprise size and maturity), and institutional factors (dispute type and government policy invocation). Using fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 287 first‐instance telecommuting labor‐dispute judgments from China in 2020, we identify five equifinal pathways to employee success. These pathways reveal that no single factor guarantees victory; instead, success depends on specific synergies, such as high‐income employees leveraging policy support in individual disputes or long‐tenured employees utilizing collective action against strong enterprises. These findings offer a configurational perspective on how resources and institutional factors jointly shape remote‐work litigation outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rapid expansion of emerging digital technologies, human resource practitioners are increasingly adopting advanced electronic performance monitoring (EPM) approaches to ensure employee compliance and productivity. However, they have largely overlooked that the invasive EPM may lead to unintended, reversed outcomes, such as cheating. Integrating the self‐protection model of workplace cheating and fairness heuristic theory, our research aims to delineate how and when perceived EPM invasiveness triggers employee cheating. Through a field survey and an experimental study, we obtained converging evidence supporting our model. Specifically, we find that perceived EPM invasiveness leads to cheating via anger (a self‐protection emotion) and moral disengagement (a self‐protection cognition). In addition, overall justice mitigates the harmful psychological and behavioral consequences of perceived EPM invasiveness. This research contributes to the EPM literature and provides practical guidance to organizations on the effective use of performance management tools in the digital era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bridges are critical but sparse links in land transport networks. I exploit quasi-experimental variation in bridge construction over major rivers in the United States to measure the causal effects of land transport infrastructure. Bridges are more often built upstream than downstream of tributary confluences—where smaller rivers join larger rivers—generating local differences in connectivity. These local connectivity advantages have negative effects on per capita income. In contrast, major changes in connectivity arising from the opening of major bridges increase per capita economic activity. A narrative explanation that can reconcile both results is that land transport infrastructure creates productivity advantages that drive economic growth, structural transformation, and urbanization over large spatial scales. Local sorting within the cities that form around early transport routes then reverses this gradient over smaller spatial scales.</content>

    <title>Revolutionary Sparks: Exploring the Resource Spillover Effect of Street Protests on Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research in advanced economies shows that street protests can indirectly influence untargeted firms through informational spillovers. We propose that, in developing economies, the indirect effects of street protests extend beyond information cues to include a resource spillover effect. Specifically, local officials may be motivated to defuse or redirect the momentum of street protests by appealing to constituents’ aspirations for economic well-being. This middle-ground approach sits between symbolic gestures and targeted policies directly addressing activists’ grievances and can facilitate the creation of new organizations. Using a longitudinal data set organized by city-year observations in China between 2008 and 2019, we examine how street protests over noneconomic issues impact the founding of new ventures. We find that city mayors’ response to street protests indirectly facilitates entrepreneurship by lowering business operating costs and increasing access to capital. Further, the resource spillover effect on businesses is accentuated by a political opportunity structure that enhances the impact of street protests on the responses of local politicians.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18885 .</content>

    <title>Devaluations, Deposit Dollarization, and Household Heterogeneity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the aggregate and redistributive effects of currency devaluations in a small open economy model with leverage-constrained banks and heterogeneous households. Our framework captures three stylized facts about financial dollarization in emerging economies: i) a sizable share of domestic deposits is denominated in foreign currency; ii) these deposits represent significant foreign currency liabilities for local banks; and iii) dollar deposits are mainly held by wealthier households. A devaluation increases the real burden of foreign currency debt, causing an erosion of banks' net worth, which depresses credit supply and economic activity. While richer households are partially insulated through their dollar deposits, poorer households cut consumption sharply in response to rising borrowing costs and falling real labor income. In our model deposit dollarization amplifies the contractionary effects of a devaluation on output, investment, and consumption, in line with new empirical evidence for emerging economies. To achieve this result, both constrained intermediaries and heterogeneous households are crucial. In our framework, regulating dollarization can result in widespread welfare gains, especially for poorer households.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The information banks produce drives their lending decisions and macroeconomic outcomes, but this information is inherently difficult to analyze because it is private. We construct a novel measure of bank information quality from confidential regulatory data that include banks’ private risk assessments for US corporate loans. Information quality improves as local economic conditions deteriorate, particularly for new loans, large loans, and loans with higher expected losses. Information quality also declines during periods of rapid local house price appreciation. Our results provide empirical support for theories of countercyclical information production in credit markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When firms finance using long-term nominal debt issued by financial intermediaries, changes in expected inflation lead to a wealth transfer across sectors. Higher expected inflation decreases firms' real liabilities and default risk, which helps reduce debt overhang. However, it hurts intermediaries' real assets, leading to a contraction in credit supply. We theoretically demonstrate that intermediary financing conditions play a key role in the transmission of nominal shocks, influencing the premium investors require for bearing inflation risk. We provide empirical evidence supporting our novel inflation transmission mechanism and connect our findings to the banking stress of 2023. We also show that Taylor rules responding to both financial and real variables can help stabilize our economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A screening instrument is costly if it is socially wasteful and productive otherwise. A principal screens an agent with multidimensional private information and quasilinear preferences that are additively separable across two components: a onedimensional productive component and a multidimensional costly component. Can the principal improve upon simple one-dimensional mechanisms by also using the costly instruments? We show that if the agent has preferences between the two components that are positively correlated in a suitably defined sense, then simply screening the productive component is optimal. The result holds for general type and allocation spaces, and allows for nonlinear and interdependent valuations. We discuss applications to monopoly pricing, bundling, and labor market screening.</content>

    <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Managing Supply Chain Data Security: The Differentially Private Newsvendor</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An Algorithmic Approach to Managing Supply Chain Data Security: The Differentially Private NewsvendorIn “An Algorithmic Approach to Managing Supply Chain Data Security: The Differentially Private Newsvendor,” Chen and Chua examine an emerging challenge in data-driven operations: inventory decisions can unintentionally reveal sensitive demand information. Even when raw demand data are never shared, observers may reverse-engineer the data from small changes in order quantities. This risk is particularly acute in supply chains, where decisions are frequent, data-intensive, and easily observable. To mitigate this threat, the paper develops a suite of differentially private algorithms for the contextual newsvendor problem. These methods introduce carefully calibrated randomness into the newsvendor model, ensuring strong privacy protection under differential privacy while maintaining near-optimal operational performance. The authors also identify key drivers of the cost of privacy—data set size, contextual richness, and product variety—offering actionable guidance for firms seeking secure yet efficient data-driven operations. Finally, they demonstrate that privacy-preserving decisions can distort demand signals and reduce upstream supplier profits, highlighting important supply-chain-wide implications of data protection.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In “Post Reinforcement Learning Inference,” Vasilis Syrgkanis and Ruohan Zhan develop a new inferential framework for data collected via reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the adaptive systems that update strategies as outcomes unfold. Traditional statistical methods fail in this setting because adaptivity induces time-varying variance and dependence across samples. Syrgkanis and Zhan propose an adaptively weighted generalized method of moments (AW-GMM) estimator that stabilizes this variance through data-dependent weights. They prove that the weighted estimator achieves consistency and asymptotic normality, enabling valid hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for policy values and dynamic treatment effects. Their method provides a unified approach for structural estimation and inference under nonstationary, adaptively generated sequence data, with applications to dynamic off-policy evaluation and personalized decision systems.</content>

    <title>The Zombie Lending Channel of Monetary Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a new channel in the monetary policy transmission to nonfinancial corporates—the zombie lending channel. Our findings show that unviable and unproductive zombie firms are less affected by contractionary monetary policy relative to other firms because of a more muted tightening in credit conditions. We rationalize this result with a strengthening in evergreening motives when interest rates rise: lenders face incentives to extend loans to zombies to prevent them from defaulting. Strengthening banks’ balance sheets and curbing risky lending behavior could help mitigate zombie lending practices when financial conditions tighten.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07315 .</content>

    <title>What Do Trade Allowances Look Like? Evidence from Actual Payments to a Big-Box Retailer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document key features of trade allowances—a major component of the contracts between large retailers and manufacturers—using a unique panel data set on allowance payments negotiated between two supermarket chains owned by a large retailer and its suppliers over a two-year period. We show that trade allowances are large in magnitude, are paid by the vast majority of suppliers, and vary substantially over categories and, especially, across suppliers within categories. We further study trade allowance behavior along key dimensions of the manufacturer–retailer relationship. First, we report important interdependencies between allowances paid by multicategory suppliers across different categories, suggesting that single-category analysis of manufacturer–retailer interactions may be misleading. Second, we show that dedicated private label manufacturers do pay allowances, and that dual branders (i.e., national brand manufacturers who in addition produce private labels) tend to pay lower allowances than fully national brand manufacturers. Third, we examine the relationship between allowance payments and price promotional activities and find that price and nonprice incentives tend to be treated as substitutes. Fourth, we document a positive relationship between allowance payments and prices, suggesting that trade allowances do not mitigate the double marginalization problem. Finally, the evidence suggests that both market power and efficiency aspects are at play in the explanation of trade allowances.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute for Research in Market Imperfections and Public Policy [Grant ICM IS130002] and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico [Initiation Grant 11180301 and Regular Grant 1170029].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00817 .</content>

    <title>Platform Expansion Through Asset Provision: Ownership, Commitment, and Flexibility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service platforms connect consumers to independent providers, who typically deliver the service using their own assets (e.g., ride-hailing with suitable vehicles). To expand their services, platforms have introduced programs aimed at attracting prospective providers who lack the requisite assets. These programs diverge in terms of asset ownership and contract structures. In platform financing, the platform offers to finance providers’ asset investments, serving as an alternative to bank loans. Under employment and rental schemes, by contrast, the platform itself invests in assets and offers them to providers through long-term employment-like contracts or short-term rentals. We develop a game-theoretical model to study the viability and relative performance of these mechanisms. With bank financing as benchmark, we find that although each mechanism can be profitable, they also face distinct challenges. For example, platform financing often fails to benefit the platform in its simple interest-only form and instead requires payments tied to providers’ on-platform performance. Comparing these mechanisms highlights a tradeoff between the platform committing to a mutually beneficial contract with the providers and leveraging their flexibility as independent service providers. Consequently, the platform prefers the strongest commitment option—employment—when demand is high and investment cost is low and turns to the flexible financing or rental options as demand weakens or investment cost increases. Additionally, we find that minimum-wage regulation could benefit not only service providers but also the platform, particularly under financing or rental. Finally, when the providers’ outside options rely less on access to assets, employment gains ground as the preferred expansion strategy.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: S.

    <title>More Light but Less Sight? The Dual Effect of Information Transparency on Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whether more information available in capital markets fosters or hinders corporate innovation—and ultimately long-term firm value—remains a contentious question. Does enhanced transparency discipline managerial decision-making, or does it induce short-termism? This study addresses this tension by proposing that firms’ R&amp;D capabilities critically moderate these opposing effects. Leveraging the European Union’s mandate for quarterly reporting as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ a difference-in-differences design to a panel of EU-listed manufacturing firms. We uncover a dual pathway: For firms with weaker R&amp;D capabilities, greater transparency exerts a disciplining effect, leading to reduced R&amp;D investment and enhancing firms’ value. Conversely, firms with stronger capabilities reallocate R&amp;D toward more familiar domains to deliver quicker returns, consistent with a myopic response that limits exploration and undermines long-term value. Our findings contribute to management theory by unpacking how capital market pressures differentially affect the “whether” and “where” of innovation decisions and offer policymakers important insights into the unintended consequences of disclosure regulation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the increasing recognition of digital globalization in international business (IB) literature, there is a more pressing need for a comprehensive understanding of the unprecedented power generated by big-tech multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper suggests that harnessing data ubiquity globally, instantaneously, and continuously represents a defining feature and a revolutionary power source for big-tech MNEs. By leveraging global data value chains through  a mutually reinforcing data-AI feedback loop of data access, analysis, and application, big-tech MNEs can reshape IB practices and challenge global regulatory frameworks. Drawing on power-dependence theory, our research framework highlights a logic of power mutuality characterized by the interplay between power generation and power counterbalance. These two forces provide a holistic lens for examining how big-tech MNEs create data-based power, but are simultaneously countered by the economic and sociopolitical stakeholders of big-tech MNEs. We propose promising avenues for future research on MNEs’ data strategies, global data value chains, foreignness and liabilities of data, and global data governance.</content>

    <title>A Robust Optimization Approach to Reliable Statistical Inference with Variables Generated by Machine Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations increasingly use machine learning to turn text, images, and other unstructured data into variables that inform decisions and research. But, because machine learning predictions are never perfect, the resulting data can contain errors that quietly distort statistical analyses, sometimes leading to incorrect conclusions about what truly drives important outcomes. This study introduces a robust optimization approach that helps analysts and decision makers draw more reliable insights when working with machine learning–generated data. The method is designed to strengthen the signal of real effects, reducing the influence of noisy or imperfect predictions, resulting in more trustworthy hypothesis tests and fewer missed or misleading findings. The approach also includes a simple correction step that uses a small amount of high-quality labeled data—such as a subset of manually reviewed cases—to further improve accuracy. Across simulations and a real-world example using Amazon reviews, the method consistently delivers more dependable results than common alternatives. For professionals who rely on machine learning in areas such as marketing, operations, public policy, or risk management, this framework offers a practical, transparent way to ensure that conclusions remain sound even when data sources are imperfect.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in human resource management (HRM), especially in performance appraisals, questions arise about how employees respond to AI involvement in these processes. While existing research often treats AI as a technical tool, this study also views AI as a social actor that interacts with employees. Using sociomateriality and attribution theory, we examine how AI's characteristics and its role in appraisal procedures influence employee satisfaction with performance appraisals. Across three scenario‐based experiments with 1002 participants and one survey with 321 respondents, we find that certain characteristics of the AI rater and the decision‐making power distribution in AI appraisal procedures have a significant impact on employees' performance appraisal satisfaction. These results highlight the importance of considering the technical and social dimensions of AI in HRM practices. Our findings offer practical guidance for organizations implementing AI in performance appraisals and contribute to a deeper understanding of AI's impact on the employee experience.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To improve sales and operational processes that support business outcomes, such as converting sales opportunities and the revenue from these conversions, firms invest in sales content platforms—shared digital warehouses for storing, managing, and distributing information required for sales activities. However, the effectiveness of such digital sales operations investments remains unclear. To investigate, this study explores the effects of salespeople accessing sales content platforms across two studies. First, a qualitative study reveals that access to sales content platforms helps salespeople learn valuable information and adapt their behaviors throughout the sales process. Salespeople with extensive tenure benefit disproportionately from sales content platform access, especially when it is unclear which information to rely on and how best to act on it. These insights inform the quantitative analysis in our second study, which utilizes a unique dataset from a global business-to-business firm specializing in advanced technologies. The results confirm that access to sales content platforms helps salespeople convert sales opportunities, but this effect depends on the type of content accessed, the sales process phase, and salesperson tenure. Furthermore, the benefits of sales content platform access do not always lead to increased revenue from converted opportunities. These findings offer actionable guidance for managers seeking to maximize returns on their investments in sales content platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that exposure to anti‐capitalist ideology can exert a lasting influence on attitudes toward capital markets and stock market participation. Using novel survey, bank, and broker data, we document that, decades after Germany's reunification, East Germans invest significantly less in stocks and hold more negative views on capital markets. Effects vary by personal experience under communism. Results are strongest for individuals who remember life in the German Democratic Republic positively, for example, those living in a “showcase city.” Results reverse for those with negative experiences like environmental pollution or lack of Western TV entertainment.</content>

    <title>When do firms learn by hiring? How complexity moderates the value of new knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations often hire employees hoping to acquire new knowledge. While the literature has paid considerable attention to the role of the characteristics of the source of knowledge, the recipient firm, and the knowledge being transferred, it has largely overlooked those of the knowledge being replaced. Using a computational model, we examine how the pre‐existing knowledge of the hiring firm—specifically its degrees of internal and external fit—influences its ability to learn. Our findings suggest that firms with lower internal fit absorb new knowledge more quickly, even when controlling for initial external fit. We identify several mechanisms driving this dynamic, demonstrating how persistent resistance to new knowledge and sudden shifts can emerge solely through mutual learning dynamics between individuals and organizations, independent of social or cognitive constraints.Managerial SummaryCompanies frequently hire employees from competitors to gain new knowledge and improve performance. We show that success in learning by hiring depends not only on who firms hire but also on the characteristics of their existing knowledge. Our findings reveal two counterintuitive dynamics. First, firms whose practices exhibit a high degree of fit face greater difficulty in absorbing new knowledge. Such extant knowledge is stickier, as incumbent employees find it harder to abandon their old approaches and keep pulling the organization back to the status quo. Second, in complex environments, struggling firms that hire aggressively may learn less effectively, as multiple hires provide conflicting advice. Thus, while such firms stand to learn more from hiring, the internal dynamics of learning within the organization frustrate the firm's effort to absorb the knowledge. We subsequently present and analyze the mechanisms responsible for these outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do resolution frameworks affect the private restructuring of distressed banks? We model a bank’s shareholders and creditors negotiating a restructuring, under two frictions: asymmetric information about asset quality and externalities on the government. High-quality banks signal themselves by delaying the negotiation, which is socially inefficient. Public policies can improve welfare if they reduce the signaling motive or increase the negotiation surplus. Stricter bail-in rules make debt more information sensitive and increase delays. The bank chooses a capital structure with too little renegotiable debt, giving a new rationale, for example, for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity requirements. (JEL G21, G28)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the design of debt repayment schedules affect household borrowing? To answer this question, we exploit a Swedish policy reform that eliminated interest-only mortgages for loan-to-value ratios above 50%. We document substantial bunching at the threshold, leading to 5% lower borrowing. Wealthy borrowers drive the results, challenging credit constraints as the primary explanation. We develop a model to evaluate the mechanisms driving household behavior and find that much of the effect comes from households experiencing ongoing flow disutility to amortization payments. Our results indicate that mortgage contracts with low initial payments substantially increase household borrowing and lifetime interest costs. (JEL G51, G21, E21, E6)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We address the issues of unequal restroom access for women and LGBTQ+ individuals, known as the potty parity problem. We propose a utility model in which users consider gender identity, wait time, and safety concerns when choosing restrooms. We evaluate different layouts’ efficiency measured by the total utilities (as in the utilitarian principle) and assess their fairness using the measures of the minimum utility gain (as in the Rawlsian fairness) and the gap between maximum and minimum gains (as in the distributive fairness). When the population is sensitive to gender identity and safety concerns, although it may initially seem intuitive to assume that converting all restrooms to unisex facilities would be efficient and fair due to the pooling of servers and increased flexibility and perceived fairness due to all users standing in the same line, our findings demonstrate that this design can be neither efficient nor fair. In contrast, we show that converting some men’s restrooms to unisex can enhance both efficiency and fairness of access. This highlights that a moderate level of flexibility can outperform a fully flexible system. Moreover, conventional wisdom suggests that removing a restroom unit from the men’s room would negatively impact users from the men’s side. However, our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that such a change can lead to a Pareto improvement, benefiting all users involved. We also analytically explore additional benefits of unisex restrooms under different user behaviors and situations and present practically relevant numerical results to support our findings.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2021-04295].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04075 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent workplace trends reveal that workers frequently discuss and engage in deliberate underperformance, underscoring the growing relevance of intentional underperformance at work. Although various disciplines have long studied purposeful reductions in work effort, these investigations have remained largely siloed, hindering conceptual clarity. In this scoping review, we integrate perspectives from management, social and educational psychology, and economics to establish a unified conceptualization of intentional underperformance (i.e., the deliberate suppression of task contributions, such that contributions fall below a relevant benchmark). In doing so, we make five primary contributions to the performance literature. First, we review and consolidate 36 related constructs to develop an umbrella conceptualization that can promote cumulative scientific understanding. Second, based on our review, we present an organized view of the antecedents and proximal motives of intentional underperformance. Third, we introduce the Intentional Underperformance Framework, a two-by-two that organizes forms of intentional underperformance, and organize the associated outcomes of these different forms. Fourth, we identify cross-disciplinary patterns in operationalizations, summarizing prevailing methods and their implications. Fifth, we outline a research agenda to guide future inquiry into when, why, and how intentional underperformance arises, as well as how organizations can constructively intervene. By integrating disconnected literatures and promoting a shared language, this review provides a foundation for more integrative theoretical and empirical inquiries. Ultimately, we aim to equip scholars and practitioners with a clearer, more comprehensive understanding of intentional underperformance in today’s workplace.</content>

    <title>Beyond Blame: Evaluative Stigma, Attribution, and Employee Careers after Employer Failure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employment continuity facilitates access to career opportunities, professional growth, and financial security, making involuntary disruptions—such as employer failures—potentially consequential for individuals’ career trajectories. Although prior research has explored how organizational leaders’ careers fare following employer failure, the implications for non-executive employees remain unclear in theoretical terms. Integrating theories of evaluation, evaluative stigma, and careers, we develop a theoretical framework to clarify how employer failure relates to subsequent career outcomes for employees. Using confidential, anonymized data from the United States Census complemented by detailed, identifiable data from the Automatic Speech Recognition industry, we find that employer failure is negatively related to organizational leaders’ wage growth, consistent with internal attribution and evaluative stigma. Conversely, non-executive employees experience wage (and industry retention) outcomes comparable to those of their unaffected peers, suggesting that affiliation with a failed employer does not stigmatize this set of employees. However, non-executive employees are not always unscathed: Career penalties emerge when failure involves a scandal, when industry labor-market conditions become more competitive, and when employees belong to some marginalized demographic groups (gender, race, immigration). By clarifying the conditions of evaluative stigma, we extend organizational research on careers and evaluations, highlighting the conditions under which affiliations with failed firms relate to subsequent career outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rapid credit expansions predict lower output growth and banking crises, but does it matter who finances them? We identify the ultimate counterparties financing credit expansions in a panel of 33 advanced economies and find that foreign-financed household credit expansions predict lower GDP growth and higher crisis risk, but domestically financed credit expansions do not. Studying the mechanisms, we find that foreign-financed household credit expansions are accompanied by higher supply of foreign capital (reflected in low credit spreads), are followed by elevated credit cycle reversal risk, and lead to higher debt service payments to foreigners which depress aggregate demand.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The entrepreneurship literature has focused on the communicative function of language, but has rarely examined linguistic capital’s effects on entrepreneurship, particularly that of dialect similarity. This research explores the role of dialect similarity in the self-employment of rural-urban migrants and how social capital, including networks and trust, mediates the role of dialect similarity in a developing economy setting. Integrating the linguistic capital theory of French sociologist Bourdieu with the social capital theory, the study examines the decision of rural-urban migrants’ self-employment in China. Analyzing the dataset from the China Migrants Dynamic Survey, we argue that rural-urban migrants who speak a dialect similar to the place of residence have a higher likelihood of engaging in self-employment, and that social capital plays a positive mediating role in self-employment decisions. We employ the Instrumental Variable and Propensity Score Matching method with a quasi-experimental approach for our empirical test. Results from both approaches strongly support our hypotheses. Lastly, research contributions and implications are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial CEOs, characterized by greater concern for their employees, enhance employee motivation but incur higher costs when implementing layoffs. We develop a psychological model of CEO‐firm matching wherein negative industry shocks requiring downsizing asymmetrically erode the match quality for prosocial CEOs. Leveraging increases in Chinese import competition, we show that layoff pressures lead to higher rates of both forced and voluntary turnover among prosocial CEOs. They are succeeded by less prosocial CEOs who are externally recruited, use less employee‐friendly language, lean Republican in political orientation, or are less likely to volunteer at charities. Our study highlights psychological characteristics as a key consideration in the executive labor market and draws attention to the “first‐stage” selection dynamics that shape the types of CEOs who lead firms.Managerial SummaryWhich firms CEOs choose to join and which CEOs are selected or retained by boards depend not only on their skills but also on the fit between their ‘personality’ and the firm's needs. We show that during industry downturns that require aggressive downsizing, prosocial CEOs are more likely to depart voluntarily, and boards actively replace them with low‐prosocial “wartime” CEOs. This dynamic nature of the CEO‐firm fit provides insights into why and when previously effective leadership may become ineffective and empirical grounds for the common distinction between peacetime and wartime CEOs. A key implication is that increasing Chinese import competition has shaped not only firm economic activities but also the psychological profiles of business leaders.</content>

We develop a word list of intangibles and apply it to takeover announcements. One standard deviation more in intangible-related language (“intangibles talk”) lowers announcement returns for the acquirer by 0.53 percentage points and predicts worse operating performance. Bidder managers appear to believe in the deals nonetheless, as evidenced by insider trades, payment choices, and completion probabilities and speed. Overall, takeover announcement texts reveal important information about hard-to-measure aspects of deal quality. (JEL G14, G34, G41)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theory of competitive equilibrium with indivisible goods based entirely on economic conditions on demand. The key idea is to analyze complementarity and substitutability between bundles of goods, rather than merely between goods themselves. This approach allows us to formulate sufficient and essentially necessary conditions for equilibrium existence—which unify settings with complements and settings with substitutes. Our analysis has implications for auction design.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study assesses concentration of the top 50 universities (T50 concentration) in premier business journals and its correlation with journal impact metrics. We use 2008-2022 data from the Web of Science and Clarivate Analytics, focusing on 46 business journals from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD 24) and Financial Times (FT 50) lists to document several findings. First, we find that the top 50 institutions, representing less than 0.5% of business schools globally, contribute a disproportionately large share of about 53% publications in these outlets. Second, our longitudinal analyses indicate that T50 concentration has remained relatively stable over the 15-year period. Finally, we find evidence of a positive and statistically significant association between T50 concentration and Article Influence Score, although we do not find any statistically significant relationship with other journal impact metrics. Importantly, we find a decline in the publication and citation share of articles authored exclusively by top-50 author teams, and a rise in share for mixed author teams from top-50 and non-top-50 universities. These findings provide data-driven insights to inform debates relating to merit and elitism in editorial and review processes in top journals.</content>

    <title>On the Impossibility of Statistically Improving Empirical Optimization: A Second Order Stochastic Dominance Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the underlying probability distribution in a stochastic optimization is observed only through data, various data-driven formulations have been studied to obtain approximate optimal solutions. We show that no such formulations can, in a sense, theoretically improve the statistical quality of the solution obtained from empirical optimization. We argue this by proving that the first order behavior of the optimality gap against the oracle best solution, which includes both the bias and variance, for any data-driven solution second order stochastically dominates that from empirical optimization as long as suitable smoothness holds with respect to the underlying distribution. We demonstrate this impossibility of improvement in examples ranging across regularized optimization, distributionally robust optimization, parametric optimization, and Bayesian generalizations. We also discuss the connections of our results to other perspectives in statistics and data-driven optimization and illustrate practical implications in choosing among data-driven formulations.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Risk Sharing in Government Contracting: Strategic Alliances as Safeguards in Government Supplier Relationships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interorganizational alliances have been extensively studied as strategic arrangements that enable firms to manage risks arising from their embeddedness in external relationships. However, the unique dynamics of business-to-government (B2G) relationships, where firms often face regulatory and political risks, remain underexplored. In this study, we examine how firms reliant on U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contracts use strategic alliances to mitigate these challenges. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm, we theorize that firms with higher government contract value are more likely to form alliances with other government contractors to help share risk and navigate government contracting challenges. We further identify two boundary conditions—an internal buffer (whether a firm operates as a generalist or specialist contractor) and an external buffer (the level of market-demand risk)—that moderate this relationship. Our analysis of 339 U.S. publicly traded DoD contractors from 2001 to 2019 provides robust support for our hypotheses. A post hoc mediation analysis further shows that alliances partially mediate the relationship between government contract value and market performance. Our study contributes to interorganizational relationships and business-government interface literatures by articulating the unique dynamics of B2G alliances and offering nuanced insights into how firms manage their relationships with powerful government buyers.</content>

    <title>Does a Long-Term Orientation Lead to Faster Growth? Firms’ Temporal Orientation and the Growth Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates how firms’ temporal orientation—operationalized through their investment horizon—influences the growth process. We propose that longer investment horizons reflect a forward-looking orientation that facilitates resource accumulation and capability development, ultimately supporting firm expansion. However, we also argue that excessively long horizons may lead to diminishing returns due to organizational frictions and coordination constraints. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between investment horizon and growth in fixed assets, employment, and sales. These findings underscore the complex role of temporal orientation in shaping distinct aspects of firm growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how online and offline shareholder activism influences a firm’s innovation focus—on exploration or exploitation—in family and non-family firms. We theorize, from a mixed gamble perspective, that such activisms pose distinctive threats to a firm’s economic and non-economic interests. We analyze 7,887 firm-year observations from Chinese listed firms (2012–2022) and find that non-family firms are more likely than family firms to shift toward exploitation in response to offline activism, and family firms are more inclined to focus on exploration when facing online activism. Additionally, second-generation family firms are found to be more responsive than first-generation firms to both forms of shareholder activism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I investigate whether there is a causal relationship between physical health and entrepreneurship by exploiting the exogenous introduction of the British Clean Air Act (CAA). This legislation generated across-cohort differences in exposure to airborne pollution. A fuzzy regression discontinuity design is used to investigate the causal impact of improved health following the CAA on adult entrepreneurship outcomes. The results carry important implications for scholarship as well as policymakers, with many governments in emerging economies seeking to curb airborne pollution and improve health and economic outcomes for their citizens, while also seeking to promote entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>A Robust Test for Weak Instruments for 2SLS with Multiple Endogenous Regressors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a test for instrument strength based on the bias of two-stage least squares (2SLS) that (1) generalizes the tests of Stock and Yogo (2005) and Sanderson and Windmeijer (2016) to be robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, and (2) extends the Montiel Olea and Pflueger (2013) robust test for models with a single endogenous regressor to multiple endogenous regressors. Our test can be based either on Stock and Yogo’s (2005) absolute bias criterion or on the 2SLS bias relative to Montiel Olea and Pflueger’s (2013) worst-case benchmark. We also develop extensions to test whether weak instruments cause bias in individual 2SLS coefficients. In simulations, our test controls size and is powerful, and we provide efficient code packages for its practical implementation. We demonstrate our testing procedures in the context of the estimation of state-dependent fiscal multipliers as in Ramey and Zubairy (2018).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we provide direct evidence on the behaviour of markups in the retail sector across space and time. Markups are measured using gross margins. We consider three levels of aggregation: the retail sector as a whole, the firm, and the product level. We find that: (1) markups are relatively stable over time and mildly procyclical; (2) there is a large regional dispersion in markups; (3) there is a positive cross-sectional correlation between local income and local markups; and (4) differences in markups across regions result from differences in the assortment of goods sold in different regions, not from deviations from uniform pricing. We propose a simple model consistent with these facts.</content>

    <title>When Interpretations of Merit Thresholds Vary and Reproduce Inequality: Entering the Tech Industry Without Computer Science Credentials</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Meritocracy is widely believed to be a fair system. Although extant literature focuses on managers’ implementation of meritocratic decisions, less attention has been paid to jobseekers’ responses to meritocratic opportunities. This study addresses this gap by examining how aspiring software developers without computer science (CS) degrees respond to the ostensibly meritocratic promise of entering tech through open-access coding skills. Drawing on interview, social media, and ethnographic data, I find that although all aspirants agreed coding skills were the key meritocratic criteria for entering tech without CS degrees, they interpreted the merit threshold (the level of coding competency needed to get their first job) differently and adopted three distinct entry strategies that varied in timing and scope—Early/Broad, Standard, and Late/Narrow. Follow-up data collected three years later revealed that one strategy (Early/Broad) was associated with high employment rates across all subgroups of aspirants and substantially increased employment chances for those historically underrepresented in tech. Yet, most did not opt for it. Indeed, only one group (White men with white-collar/professional backgrounds) clustered in strategies with higher employment rates, resulting in this population securing jobs at a higher rate than others. To explain the variation in merit thresholds and accompanying entry strategies, this study highlights aspirants’ previous encounters with demand-side actors—particularly, their perceptions of whether, and to what extent, employers had previously been willing to give them a chance. These findings contribute to research on meritocracy and labor markets and offer insights into building a more diverse workforce.Funding: This work was supported by the American Sociological Association Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement [Grant 55209764] and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth [Grant 5510223].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17752 .</content>

    <title>Matching Drivers to Riders: A Two-Stage Robust Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Matchmaking for Ride-Hailing PlatformsRide-hailing platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and DiDi must assign drivers to riders every minute without knowing who will request a ride next. Most systems optimize each batch myopically, and this can leave some future riders waiting much longer than necessary. In “Matching Drivers to Riders: A Two-Stage Robust Approach,” accepted for publication in Operations Research, the authors propose a two-stage robust matching model that incorporates uncertainty about future demand. The first stage matches current riders, reserving enough nearby drivers for plausible future scenarios; the second stage then tests these decisions against the most adverse demand patterns to guarantee good performance even in the worst case. The authors prove that finding the best such policy is computationally hard, but they develop constant factor approximation algorithms for several practically relevant cases and test them on large-scale taxi data from Shenzhen, China. Their methods substantially reduce maximum rider waiting times with little or no sacrifice in average travel distances.</content>

    <title>Forecasted vs. Actual Generosity in Image-Concern Interventions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research and lay intuition suggest that amplifying image concerns promotes generosity. We test the impact of image-based interventions in consumer elective pricing (CEP), where individuals choose how much to pay for products or services. Across 10 studies (nine field experiments and one laboratory study, n = 3,182), we examine the effects of these interventions on payments and elicit forecasts from independent participants (n = 1,636). Forecasters predict large positive effects, yet behavioral data reveal small and inconsistent impacts. What drives the inconsistency between predictions and actual outcomes? Studies with more than 4,000 forecasters show that neither simulating the decision-making experience nor prior experience with CEP improve prediction accuracy. However, avoiding direct comparisons between experimental conditions—which can artificially amplify perceived differences—reduces overestimation. These findings highlight challenges associated with transferring behavioral insights across contexts and show how forecast elicitation methods shape expectations of intervention effectiveness.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00149 .</content>

    <title>Missing Team Dynamics? An Integrative Review of Research on Team Development Over Time</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory describing the development, functioning, and performance of work teams emphasizes their dynamic nature. For many years, empirical research on teams has failed to keep pace with theory, impeding understanding of how teamwork unfolds over time and teams as a whole. However, over the past several decades, research examining the onset and functioning of change in teams has significantly increased. Our review distinguishes two primary theoretical perspectives that have dominated the field’s understanding of team development and provides a foundation for integrating both perspectives, which would allow for a more nuanced understanding. With the overarching goal of summarizing findings from this burgeoning literature, we conduct a systematic review of 110 articles (116 studies) that examine team development and teams over time. We synthesize evidence to illustrate how team phenomena (i.e., composition, leadership, emergent states, processes, and outcomes) change over time and interact dynamically with one another. We conclude by offering several high-level critiques of the literature, along with proposed solutions to address these issues. In doing so, we move beyond a general call for more research on team dynamics toward a more precise account of the decisions and considerations that should guide future work. Taken together, our manuscript provides scholars with a detailed account of how teams develop over time, challenging the long-held assumption that there is a dearth of work in this domain, and a foundation to position future work within a more integrated understanding of team development.</content>

    <title>The Glass Is Half Full: A Gendered Model of Illegal Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals in impoverished communities often face considerable adversity. Under such circumstances, they can turn to illegal entrepreneurship. However, from a gendered perspective, women are typically considered incongruent with the masculinity of crime and entrepreneurship and, thus, illegal entrepreneurship. In this study, we were interested in exploring how women navigate their society’s gender role expectations to engage in illegal entrepreneurship. We adopted a qualitative, inductive approach to explore the cognitive processes through which women entrepreneurs navigate these tensions to manufacture and sell illegal alcohol within their impoverished communities throughout India. Our resulting gendered model of the cognitive processes underlying illegal entrepreneurship in impoverished communities offers new insights into how women entrepreneurs use cognitive carve-outs to navigate potentially conflicting societal expectations regarding gender and entrepreneurial roles. Further, we explore how entrepreneurship is influenced by construals, particularly in contexts of resource scarcity and gendered constraints. Finally, in line with the dark side of entrepreneurship, we shed light on how women can justify to themselves and others entrepreneurial action that, while shielding themselves from immediate personal repercussions, imposes substantial costs on many members of their impoverished communities.</content>

    <title>The Orchestrator’s Dilemma: How Ericsson Strategically Recombined Resource Commitments and Signaling Tactics to Outmaneuver WiMAX</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Orchestrators shape ecosystem development by aligning diverse participants while advancing their own competitive agendas. This alignment becomes fragile when a new entrant offers an alternative value proposition that appeals to ecosystem participants but threatens an orchestrator’s position. Whereas prior research highlights the success of new entrants, less is known about how an orchestrator defends its competitive interests and position while addressing expectations of cooperation from ecosystem participants, which we call the “orchestrator’s dilemma.” We investigate these dynamics through a longitudinal study of Ericsson’s responses as Intel attempted to promote WiMAX as an alternative to LTE, Ericsson’s fourth-generation mobile technology. Our analysis shows how Ericsson recombined its substantive resource commitments and signaling tactics to develop three distinct strategic responses—avoiding competition, covert competition, and overt competition—as ecosystem support for the new entrant’s value proposition changed over time. We show how an orchestrator can defend its position against disruptive entrants by decoupling signaling tactics from substantive resource commitments to influence ecosystem dynamics. We contribute by theorizing these dynamic strategic responses as a way to overcome the orchestrator’s dilemma and by highlighting the social aspects of ecosystem alignment and its fragility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how gender-biased technological change in agriculture affected women’s work in twentieth-century Norway. In the 1950s, dairy farms began widely adopting milking machines to replace milking cows by hand, a task typically performed by young women. We show that the machines pushed rural young women in dairy-intensive areas out of farming. The displaced women moved to cities where they acquired more education and found better-paying, skilled employment. Our results suggest that the adoption of milking machines broke up allocative inefficiencies associated with moving costs across sectors, which improved the economic status of women relative to men.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a leverage theory of tying in markets with network effects. When a monopolist in one market cannot perfectly extract surplus from consumers, tying can be a mechanism through which unexploited consumer surplus is used as a demand-side leverage to create a “quasi-installed base” advantage in another market characterized by network effects. Our mechanism does not require any precommitment to tying; rather, tying emerges as a best response that lowers the quality of tied-market rivals. While tying can lead to exclusion of tied-market rivals, it can also expand use of the tying product, leading to ambiguous welfare effects. (JEL D41, D85, K21, L15, L40)</content>

    <title>Sequential Learning under Informational Ambiguity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates a sequential social learning problem in which individuals face ambiguity about others’ signal structures and have max-min expected utility preferences, thereby exhibiting ambiguity aversion. Unlike previous findings, which suggest that learning outcomes depend on the specifics of the learning environment, this study establishes information cascades as a robust outcome under ambiguity. With sufficient ambiguity, cascades arise almost surely, regardless of the statistical properties of signal structures. Moreover, standard results predicting the absence of cascades can easily break down: Even minimal ambiguity can trigger cascades when signals are bounded and lead to incorrect herding when signals are unbounded.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that higher rates of distressed home sales (i.e., foreclosures and short sales) among Black and Hispanic homeowners severely reduce realized housing returns for these groups—in particular, to a level below that realized by White homeowners. Yet absent financial distress, houses owned by minorities do not appreciate at substantially slower rates than houses owned by nonminorities. Racial differences in liquidity and income stability, which are imperfectly observed by lenders, are important determinants of differences in distress. Policies that prevent foreclosure among distressed minorities can mitigate the racial gap in returns. (JEL D31, G51, J15, R31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should optimal income taxation change when firms have market power? We analyze how the planner can optimally tax labor income of workers and profits of entrepreneurs. We derive optimal tax rates that depend on markups and identify four distinct components: the Mirrleesian incentive effect, the Pigouvian tax correction of the negative externality of market power, redistribution through altered factor prices, and reallocation of output toward the most productive firms. We quantify the optimal tax for the US economy and provide concrete proposals how to use income taxation to redistribute income while incentivizing production in the presence of market power.

    <title>Risk Preferences and Field Behavior: The Relevance of Higher-Order Risk Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using new methods, we measure the intensities of higher-order risk preferences (prudence and temperance) in an incentivized experiment with 658 adolescents. Aligned with theory, we find that higher-order risk preferences are strongly related to field behavior, including prevention, health, addictive behavior, and financial decision-making. Most importantly, we show that ignoring prudence and temperance can yield misleading conclusions about the relation of risk preferences to field behavior, and that survey measures of risk tolerance often relate to field behavior because they capture higher-order risk preferences.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many employers link wages at establishments outside of the home region to the level at headquarters. We show this using new data on 1,200 multinationals’ establishments across the world and linked employee-level data on their establishments in Brazil. Headquarters wage changes arising from minimum wage and exchange rate shocks are partially transmitted to workers employed in the same position abroad. Wage change transmission appears to be direct and results from firm-wide wage-setting procedures rather than associated technology or employment changes. “Anchored” wage setting is somewhat associated with particular characteristics of the job × employer × headquarters-establishment country-pair.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal monetary policy during times of global scarcity of tradable goods. The optimal monetary response entails a surge in inflation, which helps rebalance production toward the tradable sector. While the inflation costs are fully borne domestically, however, the gains in terms of higher supply of tradable goods partly spill over to the rest of the world. National central banks may thus fall into a coordination trap and implement an excessively tight monetary policy causing an unnecessarily sharp global contraction.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a public atlas of mean outcomes in adulthood by childhood census tract. Outcomes vary sharply across neighborhoods: For children whose parents earn $27,000, the standard deviation of mean household income in adulthood is $10,420 across tracts within counties. Only half the variation in outcomes is explained by traditional measures of neighborhood opportunity like poverty rates. Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates indicate 60 percent of the variation in outcomes across neighborhoods is driven by causal effects. We demonstrate how our statistics can be applied to better target policies to improve low-opportunity areas and help families move to affordable high-opportunity areas.

    <title>Monotonicity among Judges: Evidence from Judicial Panels and Consequences for Judge IV Designs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Judge IV designs rely on monotonicity—each judge being weakly stricter than more lenient judges in all cases. I measure monotonicity in judicial panels in five different settings and find that it is violated in up to 50 percent of nonunanimous cases. The monotonicity violations are not detected by conventional tests, but they would typically induce little bias in judge IV estimates. (JEL C26, K41, K42, O17)</content>
