    <title>Boardroom Centrality and Systematic Risk of Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that boardroom centrality increases the market beta of firms. The higher stock returns of firms with high boardroom centrality diminish and turn statistically insignificant after controlling for market betas. The effect can be attributed to a comovement in accounting fundamentals and financial policies. Overall, these findings highlight the fact that the social networks of corporate leaders (i.e., directors of corporate boards) can have a substantial effect on firms’ systematic risk exposure.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72272168, 72472169], the Major Project of Key Research Bases of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education [Grant 22JJD790047], the Beijing Natural Science Foundation [Grant 9232020], the Special Project of Humanities in Tsinghua University’s Independent Research Program [2021THZWYY09], the 2024 Special Project for Innovation Oriented Development in the “Double High” Plan of Humanities Construction, and the “Influence Enhancement Plan” project at the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University [Grant 2022051006].

    <title>When AI Becomes an Agent of the Firm: Examining the Evolution of AI in Organizations Through an Agency Theory Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our work begins with the premise that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into firm decision making parallels the emergence of the professional manager, which prompted the birth of agency theory. We examine the evolution of AI through an agency theory lens, considering how the nature of firm control and decision rights change as AI evolves. While AI will initially mimic human routines, we theorize a point at which the AI system will achieve a level of autonomy and self‐determination to be considered an agent of the firm. How, then, can we align an agent with the fate of the firm, when that agent is no longer a human? To address this, we integrate agency theory with a model of AI evolution, demonstrating that conflict between an AI agent and the firm will require a reconsideration of agency mechanisms if agent‐principal alignment is to be achieved. We theorize specific forms of monitoring and incentive alignment that serve to align an AI agent with the firm's interests, thus extending agency mechanisms in the context of AI. Our theoretical exercise offers important implications for scholarship at the intersection of AI and organizational theory, as well as considerations for practice and policy.</content>

    <title>The &lt;scp&gt;ABCs&lt;/scp&gt; of Quiet Quitting: A Bifurcated Framework of Its Passive and Deliberate Types</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our multi‐study, mixed‐methods research introduces a novel framework of quiet quitting and distinguishes it from related constructs in the human resources and organizational behavior literature. Studies 1 and 2 employ topic modeling of social and news media data and qualitative content analysis of in‐depth interviews with self‐identified quiet quitters, respectively, to examine how social media users, journalists, and quiet quitters define quiet quitting and describe its antecedents and consequences. Drawing on Kahn's framework of disengagement, we develop a bifurcated framework of quiet quitting comprising passive and deliberate types, each with distinct affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions. Study 3 uses a quasi‐Q‐sort methodology to compare passive and deliberate quiet quitting with existing human resources and organizational behavior constructs and reveals that quiet quitting is a novel concept, with its passive and deliberate types being distinct from nomologically related constructs. Our bifurcated framework makes valuable theoretical contributions and offers nuanced practical implications for organizations, establishing a solid foundation for future research to treat quiet quitting as a discrete phenomenon, moving the conversation beyond debating its academic relevance.</content>

    <title>Employee Age and the Work–Family Interface: A Meta‐Analysis and Framework Integrating Life Span and Life Course Perspectives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on the relationship between age and the work–family interface (WFI) is critical to effective human resource management. Yet, findings remain inconsistent and lack theoretical integration. We conducted a meta‐analysis (k= 256,n= 186,109) integrating lifespan and life course perspectives to develop a model of the relationship between age and the WFI. Drawing on socio‐emotional selectivity theory (SEST), a prevalent lifespan approach, results reveal a significant linear relationship between age and the WFI, with variation contingent on the construct and directionality. Age was negatively associated with work‐to‐family conflict, family‐to‐work conflict, and family‐to‐work enrichment, and positively associated with work‐to‐family enrichment and work–family balance. We integrated a life course view to examine how personal (gender, race, age cohort), situational (job, marital status), and contextual (national, global) factors moderate these relationships. Declines in work‐to‐family conflict with age occurred for men but not women, suggesting a widening gender gap for older compared to younger workers. The negative association between age and work‐to‐family conflict was stronger than for family‐to‐work conflict among older adults (over age 50 cohort) and professionals. Younger adult workers under 30 reported significant work‐to‐family conflict. The relationship between age and the WFI was significantly moderated by national (U.S., Non‐U.S.) and global (Global North, Global South) contexts, with the strength of age‐related patterns in work–family conflict varying by gender and job status. Our results highlight that future HRM studies and organizational practice should focus on advancing age‐inclusive policies to better address the increasingly varied age and work–family relationships across many employee subgroups.</content>

    <title>When Managers Stay, Workers Are Safer: Rethinking the Value of Firm-Specific Human Capital</title>
    <updated>2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Mark R. DesJardine, Zhiyan Wang</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A commonly held assumption is that firm-specific human capital benefits firms while constraining employees, particularly by reducing their external mobility. While this tension holds in many contexts, it overlooks the possibility that firm-specific human capital developed by one group of employees—managers—can generate positive externalities for others. Using a novel empirical setting and a 16-year panel of 19,044 establishments with 107,309 establishment-year observations, we find that an increase in managers’ firm-specific human capital is associated with improvements in workplace safety. These effects are especially pronounced in organizations with weak safety orientations and with higher proportions of lower-skill employees, who are typically more vulnerable to safety risks. Our findings reveal a previously underexplored channel through which firm-specific human capital creates value: by enabling managers to protect other employees. This challenges the prevailing view that firm-specific human capital primarily serves firm interests and highlights a broader set of beneficiaries—offering a new perspective on the role of managers’ firm-specific human capital in shaping organizational outcomes.</content>

    <title>Is Everyone Having a Good Time? The Effects of Complex Organizational Rituals on Employee Engagement and Behavior</title>
    <updated>2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The organizational rituals literature has primarily focused on simple rituals and their positive effects on participants. While generative, this focus has obscured the intricacy and potential downsides of complex rituals, such as workplace celebrations and team-building retreats. In our research, we leverage Interaction Rituals Theory (IRT) to broaden the theoretical foundation of the study of organizational rituals by examining the range of experiences that employees have within complex organizational rituals. First, we inductively identify the positive and negative experiences within complex organizational rituals and create scales to measure them. Next, drawing further from IRT, we develop a model explaining how these experiences affect employee engagement and identify the subsequent work behaviors most likely to be affected by ritual-induced changes in engagement (helping, loyal boosterism, and job search behavior). In two field studies in the United States and Germany, we test this model, first in a single complex organizational ritual (i.e., company holiday party) and then across a broader set of common complex organizational rituals. Across both studies, we find that employees’ positive experiences during an organizational ritual enhance engagement and predict subsequent work behavior, while their effects can be significantly diminished by negative ritual experiences, challenging the assumption that rituals are uniformly beneficial. By providing evidence for a more balanced perspective on the impact of organizational rituals, our work provides a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the true nature of organizational rituals.</content>

    <title>Wicked Crises and the (In)capacity to Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A crisis is a juncture that demands decision and action. We live in times of wicked crises, that is, crises that are non-linearly interlinked; transgress organizational, institutional, and cultural boundaries; and can be addressed only collectively. Our chances to rise to wicked crises depend on our capacity to decide and to act in concert, which is power, according to political philosopher Hannah Arendt. In this essay, in honor ofAdministrative Science Quarterly’s 70th volume, I highlight different features of wicked crises and discuss two interrelated forces that weaken and undermine such power: first, organizational fragmentation, which results in governance complexity and fault lines, and second, societal fragmentation, which manifests in growing distrust in core cultural institutions, polarization, the loss of a shared lifeworld, and the rise of authoritarianism. I conclude with a call to action for our discipline.</content>

    <title>Relational Entrepreneurial Perseverance in Extreme Contexts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs who face recurring crises must repeatedly navigate lengthy recovery processes. In this article, we go beyond immediate responses and individual-level outcomes to focus on the evolution of entrepreneurial perseverance as entrepreneurs engage with broader recovery efforts post-crisis. We examined the experiences of 33 entrepreneurs during and following the Calbuco Volcano eruptions in Chile from 2015 to 2019. We discovered three social cues that reinforce entrepreneurial perseverance over extended periods of time: descriptive (the sharing of recovery memories), injunctive (the socialization of recovery work ethic), and symbolic (the celebration of recovery legacies). Findings show how socially reinforced entrepreneurial perseverance becomes intertwined with broader recovery efforts creating a sustained collective response to crisis, which we theorize asrelational entrepreneurial perseverancein extreme contexts. This changes our understanding of long-term entrepreneurial perseverance. Perseverance resides not simply in the individual entrepreneur but in social reinforcement, social support, and the capacity for connection, that is, the connection between individual actions, group principles, and community celebration. These create entrepreneurial recovery legacies that act as memory assets to be used when the next crisis hits.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Open Design Effect</title>
    <updated>2025-08-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some firms pursue open design activities, that is, they freely share innovation-related knowledge with the outside world instead of keeping it secret or protected via patents. Through a series of lab and field studies, this research examines consumer beliefs and reactions to firms’ open design activities and documents a positiveopen design effect: presenting a product as open design (vs. not) increases its attractiveness to consumers. This effect emerges because consumers view firms that freely share innovation-related knowledge as providing benefits to society. Consistent with this societal benefits account, the effect is found to be stronger when (1) moral (vs. selfish) firm motives are made salient and (2) many (vs. few) other firms have already utilized the shared knowledge. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the effect is anchored in the notion that open design activities involve outflows of firm-internal (vs. inflows of firm-external) knowledge. By showing that consumers judge the way firms undertake innovation as more (vs. less) beneficial for society, this research extends the literatures on open design, open innovation, corporate social responsibility, and marketplace morality.</content>

    <title>From Diminishment to Development: A Sensemaking Model of How Life Experiences Foster Humility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is not uncommon for people to recount humbling experiences that have transformed how they see themselves and approach their work. Although the benefits of humbling experiences are widely assumed, we have an incomplete understanding of what these experiences entail and how they may help forge humility. Existing research consists largely of idiosyncratic lists of events that might be humbling without deeper inquiry into what makes these experiences unique or how they are integrated into one’s identity. Our theorizing combines insights from the sensemaking and humility literatures to specify the dynamic processes through which humbling experiences are internalized, including contingency factors that limit or enhance the impact of these events. This approach adds theoretical precision to the understanding of what it means to have had a humbling experience and challenges the implicit assumption that humility is a stable quality. In addition, we inform the debate about how humility relates to negative emotions and self-views by distinguishing humility itself from the process through which it is developed. Throughout the paper, we use leadership as an illustrative context to ground our theorizing, but the processes we propose apply across organizational roles. Altogether, this work provides a foundation for better understanding how humbling experiences cultivate humility—an attribute that allows individuals to approach their roles from a more self-aware, other-oriented perspective.</content>

    <title>The Illusion of Performance Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the wide adoption of performance management by organizations, there is little evidence that performance management works. In this paper, I critique both the methods and the goals of performance management. First, I note that performance management, through its reliance on top‐down decision making, robs workers of autonomy and responsibility. Next, I note that two of the three major components of performance management (aligning job performance goals with the strategic goals of the organization and using frequent informal feedback to manage performance) are flawed, and that efforts to manage performance using these tools are likely to fail. Rather than relying on managing performance, organizations should follow decades of research on supportive leadership and focus on supporting and facilitating performance rather than managing it. I call for more empirical research to evaluate the effectiveness of performance management and the effects of the various tools used to manage performance.</content>

    <title>CrossFit in the Crosshairs: A Community-Embedded Theory of Firm Responsiveness to Social Issues</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do community characteristics shape organizational responses to social issues? While existing research has focused primarily on firm-level attributes or issue characteristics, we argue that a community’s social structure systematically affects how external issues penetrate and resonate locally. We develop a theory of community permeability that links three structural features—network closure, segregation patterns, and issue connectedness—to both the local salience of social issues and subsequent firm responses. Our empirical analysis examines how thousands of locally owned CrossFit gyms in the U.S. responded to their CEO’s controversial statements following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a White police officer in 2020. Results show that issue salience was lower in communities characterized by stronger inward-focused ties and greater ethnic segregation but higher in communities more directly connected to populations affected by Floyd’s death. Firms operating in communities where the issue was more salient were more likely to respond, particularly when their dependence on community support was heightened by disruptions unrelated to the focal issue. Our study reveals how community social structure creates systematic variation in both issue salience and organizational responses, advancing understanding of when and why firms act on social issues.</content>

    <title>Cutting the apron strings: Establishing optimal distinctiveness from mentors in creative industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research has established that organizations benefit from “optimal distinctiveness,” that is, being sufficiently similar to and different from competitors. However, we know less about producers' strategic positioning choices to establish optimally distinctive identities. We explore this question through a qualitative study of chef‐owners who started their own restaurants after training with well‐known mentors. We identify two trajectories followed by chefs to establish optimal distinctiveness—legacy and divergent—and their components: interpersonal origins, strategic material and symbolic practices, tensions, and performance outcomes. Our study contributes to research by providing a more complete picture of how creative producers attempt to find an optimal balance between similarity to and difference from mentors, and the constraints they face in their strategic choices, including how these change over time.</content>

    <title>Reinvesting or Consuming Dividends: Account Structure Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is a long-standing fact that households mostly consume and rarely reinvest dividends. Among representative brokerage clients of one of Germany’s largest banks, we find the opposite: 80 percent reinvestments and 12 percent consumption. Of these reinvestments, the majority occurs with a delay after dividends are initially parked as brokerage cash. Motivated by this finding, we study payout modalities (deposits into brokerage accounts, checking accounts, or checks) as a novel mechanism that nudges investors toward reinvesting or consuming dividends. Consistent with a transition from checks to brokerage deposits, we find that the dividend consumption rate in the Consumer Expenditure Survey has decreased substantially over time.</content>

    <title>Regulatory consulting and banks’ financial reporting quality: evidence from the Dodd-Frank Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act expands bank managers’ reporting requirements to federal agencies, particularly relating to banks’ financial losses should common market and macroeconomic shocks occur. To comply with this regulation, bank managers have engaged in consulting arrangements (referred to as regulatory consulting). We examine the financial reporting quality implications associated with hiring external auditors for these services. We find banks with auditor-provided regulatory consulting, relative to banks without, have higher financial reporting quality as measured by loan loss provision validity. Consistent with knowledge spillover benefits accruing to financial audit teams, we find more pronounced effects in the fourth versus interim quarters and more frequent income-reducing Y9-C restatements. We also find auditor responsiveness to PCAOB inspections improves the effectiveness of regulatory consulting. Overall, our results suggest regulatory consulting improves the audits of estimates in judgmental financial statement accounts, despite regulatory concerns that these services may impair auditor independence.</content>

    <title>Communication, Learning, and Bargaining Breakdown: An Empirical Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bargaining breakdown is common in bargaining in environments with incomplete information. We study whether, in these environments, permitting communication impacts bargaining outcomes. On May 23, 2016, eBay Germany’s Best Offer platform introduced unstructured communication allowing desktop users, but not mobile users, to accompany offers with a message. Using this natural experiment, our difference-in-differences approach documents a 14% decrease in the rate of breakdown among compliers. Though adoption is immediate, the effect is not. We show, using text analysis, that the dynamics are consistent with repeat players learning how to use communication in bargaining. Finally, tying the two results together, we show that messages that emulate the text content of experienced sellers are more likely to be accepted.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: Part of this research was supported by the NSF [Grant SES-1629060].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00366 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An open debate in platform design is who should control pricing: the platform (centralized pricing) or its service providers (decentralized pricing). We show that a key trade-off is between regulating competition and enabling price tailoring. Centralized pricing allows the platform to manage competition, but it faces information asymmetry as it cannot observe agent costs. Decentralized pricing lets agents adjust prices to their costs, but without oversight, competition can become too strong (prices too low) or too weak (prices too high). For commission-based platforms, either form of price control can prevail depending on market conditions, implying that neither dominates. However, a relatively simple tweak—adopting an affine fee structure based on posted prices or quantities served—allows the platform to decentralize pricing control without sacrificing optimality. This flexibility further supports agent classification as independent contractors, offering platforms a valuable strategic option for how to structure their workforce.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Supporting grants have been provided by the Mack Institute for Innovation Management and the Ripple University Blockchain Research Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04078 .</content>

    <title>A Modeling Framework for Tipping in the Presence of a Social Norm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tipping is a complex phenomenon cutting across various stakeholders—firms, customers, and workers. Analyzing the long-run impact of policies related to tipping is therefore challenging. To facilitate such analysis, we develop a modeling framework in which a tipping norm forms endogenously in a market consisting of a firm that offers service to potential customers. Customers choose whether to consume the service or not and, if yes, how much to tip the server afterward. With tipping, customers show appreciation to the server by sharing a fraction of their surplus but also undergo social pressure to comply with the prevailing norm. This tipping norm is shown to evolve endogenously through a dynamic process of sequential market adjustments over time: the average tip in each period determines the tipping norm for the following period, causing the firm to adapt the price and customers to adapt their tips accordingly. Characterization of this equilibrium outcome allows us to derive qualitative results on the long-run impact of different exogenous factors on tipping: we find that the equilibrium tip-to-price ratio increases when customers are more sensitive to social pressure, their range of service valuations spreads out, or they consider the service more valuable. Building on this framework, we further investigate several economic implications of tipping pertaining to social welfare, labor cost, and service quality, thus uncovering incentives and trade-offs to which the tipping mechanism gives rise from the firm, the worker, and the customer’s perspectives.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations and supply chain management.Funding: Financial support by The Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel, The Coller Foundation, and the Israeli Science Foundation [Grant 1361/23] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03422 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the balance between text and pictorial content in marketer-generated social media posts affect user engagement? The authors address this question by using computer vision and natural language processing tools to extract the visual and textual features of 34,610 organic brand posts from Facebook and Instagram. Using a Confounding-and-Cluster-Robust Causal Forests model, they test how the balance of text and picture affects social media engagement across content and visual contexts. Results show that posts with greater emphasis on overlay text over pictorial content tend to have fewer likes and comments. However, the performance of text-oriented posts improves if text is more centered, informative, emotionally positive, and congruent with the pictorial content, and if the picture contains fewer prominent objects or less information such as social cues. They quantify how incremental changes in such content composition affect social media engagement. These findings set forth evidence-based principles for optimizing text and picture balance in marketer-generated content (MGC) and provide actionable guidelines on whether, where, when, and how to present text on an image. This research highlights the potential for transforming content and media creation from an imprecise art form into an empirical science nested within a data-driven visual optimization framework.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Trajectory of Confidence: Experience, Certainty, and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Confidence has an important influence on consumer behavior. Beyond what consumers know or believe, the confidence with which they hold those things (i.e., how certain they feel) shapes their judgments, decisions, and actions. But how does confidence shift as consumers gain experience? And what are the consequences for consumer choice? A multimethod investigation combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and experiments to examine these questions. Analysis of 3.7 million reviews from almost 100,000 consumers spanning nearly 30 years reveals a common confidence trajectory. Across diverse product categories (e.g., wine, beer, and cosmetics) there is a U-shaped relationship between experience and confidence. While gaining initial experience decreases confidence, eventually, with more experience, confidence rebounds. Further, feeling less confident leads consumers to avoid options associated with uncertainty and choose something different. This includes picking different products, avoiding brands associated with the uncertainty, and waiting longer to choose from those brands again. Taken together, this research sheds light on the evolution of confidence, how uncertainty shapes choice, and drivers of product switching and brand loyalty more generally.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of an MBA‐style executive education course in finance on corporate policies and firm performance targeting top managers of medium and large Mozambican enterprises. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the educational treatment induces changes in financial policies that improve firm performance. Specifically, a reduction in working capital (0.4 to 0.5 standard deviations) increases cash flow, and in turn long‐term investments. This effect operates primarily through a reduction in accounts receivable (0.4 to 1 standard deviations). Our findings show that targeted educational interventions can build managerial capital and enhance corporate performance by improving financial decision making among executives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of the U.S. money market fund reform implemented in October 2016 on global banks' funding supply and business activities. We show that the reform induced a large negative wholesale funding shock for global banks. In contrast to the conventional bank lending channel, the primary response of global banks to the reform was a cutback in arbitrage positions that relied on unsecured funding, rather than a reduction in loan provision. We discuss the role of postcrisis liquidity regulations and unconventional monetary policy in explaining our findings, and implications for banks' business models and deposit competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Meaningful shifts in consumption habits are essential to mitigate climate change and reduce global environmental degradation. Yet, despite the climate urgency and growing consumer concerns, the widespread adoption of sustainable behaviors has proven difficult. Why is this the case? How has the growing interdisciplinary field of sustainable consumption contributed to this debate? And where are the knowledge gaps? Guided by a comprehensive conceptual model, this article (a) delves into the keymarket,individual, and societalobstacles that hinder consumers from adopting more environmentally sustainable behaviors, (b) explores how practitioners and policymakers can help consumersminimizeorcircumventthese deterrents, and (c) highlights the pressing gaps in the literature, offering a roadmap for advancing our understanding of how to promote sustainable practices across the consumer journey—from search and purchase to usage and disposal.</content>

    <title>Toward Artificial Intelligence Compliance: Impacts and Mechanisms of Performance Feedback</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance performance, ensuring that employees use AI in compliance with organizational policies becomes crucial for realizing its full value. However, employees’ AI compliance is not guaranteed and can vary based on how their AI use is managed. This study offers timely and actionable insights into how performance feedback—both positive and negative—influences employees’ AI compliance, and how these effects vary with AI identity. Drawing on feedback intervention theory, we conduct a longitudinal field study and a randomized experiment and find that positive performance feedback promotes AI compliance, whereas negative performance feedback reduces it. Importantly, employees with high AI identity respond more strongly to both types of performance feedback. Our findings further uncover distinct underlying mechanisms—task-motivation, task-learning, and meta-cognitive processes—that channel the effects of positive and negative performance feedback on AI compliance. Taken together, organizations should tailor performance feedback as part of AI governance by considering employees’ AI identity. Positive reinforcement of AI compliance is especially effective for employees with high AI identity, whereas cautions are needed when delivering negative performance feedback to avoid undermining AI compliance. Policy guidelines should support identity-sensitive performance feedback in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research AbstractWe study how providing knowledge about “how to do entrepreneurship” influences women's pre‐entry decision to enroll in micro‐entrepreneurship training in poverty settings. We carry out a field experiment study with unemployed women in rural India, randomly exposing them to “founding templates” that depict simple and replicable business set‐ups and practices. We find that exposure to founding templates, especially those that exemplify social support rather than self‐dependence, significantly increases women's sign‐ups to entrepreneurship training. We also find that increased sign‐ups are accompanied by enhanced perceived ease of starting a business. These results shed light on what motivates women in the pre‐entry stage and offer insights on how to increase enrolment, ultimately broadening women's participation in entrepreneurship in poverty contexts.Managerial AbstractMicro‐entrepreneurship training is a widely used intervention to support women's participation in entrepreneurship in poverty settings. While existing research predominantly focuses on assessing the impact of such interventions, we ask when women are motivated to sign up for training in the first place. Our study involved a full‐day information workshop, targeting unemployed women in rural India and providing them with frameworks and practical examples of replicable business setups and practices. Results indicate that access to templates, especially those that exemplify social support rather than self‐dependence, significantly boosts women's confidence and motivation to consider entrepreneurship as a viable option. We thus identify a key institutional lever for broadening the funnel of women's entry into training and entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A New Perspective on Resilience in Flexible Supply SystemsSupply disruptions and demand uncertainty are persistent threats in today’s global operations landscape. In “Process Flexibility: A Distribution-Free Approach to Long Chain Resilience,” Chen, Chou, and Sun revisit the long-standing concept of long chain flexibility and demonstrate its resilience in the face of supply-side risks. By deriving a closed-form bound on expected sales relative to full flexibility, the study offers a robust, distribution-free guarantee that highlights the long chain’s ability to hedge against disruptions. The authors further generalize their findings using a novel moment decomposition approach, extending applicability to a broader range of service metrics and capacity-demand scenarios via semidefinite programming. Their results not only reaffirm the demand-pooling power of long chains but also position them as a highly resilient configuration in disrupted environments, offering practical insights for capacity planning in uncertain supply chains.</content>

    <title>Toward a Liquid Biopsy: Greedy Approximation Algorithms for Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses challenges in developing liquid biopsies for early-stage cancer detection through active sequential hypothesis testing (ASHT). In the problem of ASHT, a learner seeks to identify the true hypothesis (true cancer type) from a known set of hypotheses (candidate cancer types). The learner is given a set of actions (sequencing genetic intervals) and knows the distribution of the random outcome (whether a mutation is detected) of any action under any true hypothesis. Given a target error [Formula: see text], the goal is to sequentially select the fewest number of actions to identify the true hypothesis with probability at least [Formula: see text]. Motivated by applications in which the number of hypotheses or actions is massive (e.g., genomics-based cancer detection), we propose efficient greedy algorithms and provide the first approximation guarantees for ASHT, under two types of adaptivity. Our guarantees are independent of the number of actions and logarithmic in the number of hypotheses. Numerical tests on synthetic and real DNA mutation data show that our algorithms significantly outperform previous heuristic policies.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00829 .</content>

    <title>SPAC IPOs and Sponsor Network Centrality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The structure of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) generates significant information asymmetry for public investors and provides a special role for its sponsors. Leveraging the unique characteristics of SPACs, this study reexamines the debate over the role of managerial network centrality in affecting M&amp;A outcomes, namely, whether network centrality allows for more private benefits or rather adds value to firms and helps reduce information asymmetry. Specifically, we show that sponsors’ private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) connections, measured by their network centrality, explain a large portion of postmerger return variation in the cross-section. A one-standard-deviation increase in sponsors’ network centrality leads to a 1.9% higher merger and acquisition success probability and a 1.3% higher postmerger monthly abnormal return. We attribute this outperformance of firms with high managerial PE network centrality to superior fundraising and deal-sourcing abilities. Moreover, this effect is particularly pronounced in a cold market and among SPAC sponsors with more “skin in the game.” Overall, we show that network connections reflect managers’ value-creation ability more than their rent-seeking capacity; these connections can add value to mergers and help alleviate information asymmetry and associated moral hazard issues, especially when managers’ private benefits are closely linked to postmerger firm performance.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do venture capital investors react to social movements, including those that relate to historical underrepresentation in funding? We use image and name algorithms combined with clerical review to classify race for 150,000 founders and 30,000 investors. These data allow us to assess the impact of George Floyd’s murder on VC funding of Black entrepreneurs and identify which VCs were most responsive. Although VCs responded swiftly, investment in Black-founded startups reverted to prior levels within two years. This temporary reaction was concentrated among those who had never previously invested in any Black entrepreneur. Moreover, the investors who responded were less likely to invest in more than one Black-founded startup and were less inclined to engage deeply by taking a board seat. Finally, it appears that the best Black entrepreneurs may have anticipated this “token” response because they did not match with investors who had no experience funding Black startups.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06410 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper makes the first comprehensive attempt to study within‐country heterogeneity of housing returns. We introduce a new city‐level data set covering 15 OECD countries over 150 years and show that national housing markets are characterized by systematic spatial variation in housing returns. Total returns in large agglomerations are close to 100 basis points lower per year than in other parts of the same country. Excess returns outside the large cities can be rationalized as compensation for higher risk, especially higher covariance with income growth and lower liquidity. Real estate in diversified large agglomerations is comparatively safe.</content>

    <title>Chief Information Security Officers on Top Management Teams: Impact on Firms’ Innovation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing frequency of information security breaches and the rising importance of cybersecurity have prompted many firms to include chief information security officers (CISOs) in their top management teams (TMTs). Although CISOs are often viewed narrowly through a security-focused lens, our research shows that their inclusion in TMTs can offer a strategic advantage by significantly enhancing firm innovation. We identify three mechanisms that explain this effect: (1) reducing preventable security risks that might otherwise hinder innovation efforts; (2) enabling the adoption of innovation technologies (e.g., cloud computing, big data) that carry strategic security risks; and (3) strengthening security controls that protect intellectual property and mitigate innovation-related threats. Importantly, the CISO’s background matters. Those with specialized experience—either in the same industry or with prior executive roles—have a stronger impact on driving innovation. This research illuminates how CISOs’ presence on TMTs affects firms’ value creation from a security risk management perspective, and provides guidance for firms seeking to hire CISOs for innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key feature of e-commerce is the access to a wide range of geographical areas; e-commerce platforms spend much effort customizing their strategies across geographical areas. Meanwhile, online word of mouth (WOM) is becoming an increasingly important driver for product sales on e-commerce platforms. This study investigates the geographical pattern of online WOM. Specifically, we examine whether and how customers’ local environment influences the generation and direction of online WOM. Leveraging a unique research design, we measure the online WOM at a U.S. national e-commerce platform by tracking the WOM referral decisions of customers. Whereas digital technologies have enabled customers to share without physical boundaries, we find that location still plays significant roles in the generation and direction of online WOM. First, a customer’s offline social environment (e.g., friend visiting frequency, neighbor interactions) significantly explains the generation of online referrals. Second, online referrals are largely bounded locally, and referrals in areas with more local social interactions are more likely to stay local. Third, even when referrals travel far, they are more likely to point to destinations socially similar to the origins. We derive important implications for firms in allocating resources across geographical areas and in using referrals to identify high-potential geographical markets.</content>

    <title>Does earnings management matter for strategy research?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic management research often uses accounting data, despite well‐known concerns that earnings management could obscure the link between actual and measured performance. We apply methods from the econometric literature on bunching to estimate that around 15 percent of firm‐year observations in Compustat manipulate accounting earnings to achieve profitability. We show that cash‐based performance measures are less susceptible to manipulation and that the choice of accrual versus cash‐based measures “matters” for two classic strategy research questions: a decomposition of ROA variance and an analysis of persistence in firm performance. These findings underscore the importance of robustness testing and contribute to an emerging literature that reconsiders the link between theoretical constructs and empirical performance measures.Managerial SummaryTo understand what drives firm performance, researchers and practitioners often rely on reported accounting measures from annual reports. The most commonly used income‐based measures are strategically inflated or deflated through accounting and operational choices (i.e., earnings management). This article finds that approximately 15 percent of the time that ROA is reported for a fiscal year, a loss would have been reported instead of a gain if not for this manipulation. We then analyze the impact earnings management has on two types of profitability analysis by comparing accrual‐based or cash‐based profit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article extends the rare disaster framework by introducing a model with a time-varying disaster recovery feature. The model yields closed-form pricing formulas for stocks and dividend strips. Calibrated using international disaster data, it quantitatively captures both the unconditional and conditional term structures of equity risk premia. It replicates key empirical patterns, including a downward-sloping unconditional term structure of one-period returns and a countercyclical conditional slope, and generates novel predictions for capital asset pricing model beta, alpha, and price.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Analytical Insights on Inventory AllocationHow should a limited inventory of a single resource be allocated across multiple customer groups with distinct rewards and arrival rates, especially when each group has a finite population? In their paper “Optimal allocation of limited inventory among multiclass customers with finite populations” in Operations Research, the authors develop a stochastic framework and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process. By analyzing the structure of the optimal value function, they reveal a new insight; rather than gradually expanding access to lower-priority groups over time, it is in fact optimal to progressively restrict access to these groups. The paper also introduces a fluid model with an explicit solution, which provides a good approximation when the system size is large. These findings offer both theoretical and practical contributions to inventory allocation problems, with potential applications in healthcare and humanitarian resource management as well as commercial product sales.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue substitution can exist among corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments, and exogenously increasing one CSR investment could lead to a decrease in another CSR investment. We provide evidence using the U.S. states’ staggered adoptions of E-Verify mandates, which curtail a labor-related social bad by reducing the hiring of unauthorized workers and related workplace abuses. We find the mandate leads to an increase in plant-level pollution, an environmental social bad, and the effect is stronger when the mandate applies to more employers, for plants in states with more unauthorized workers in the labor force, and for plants with jobs that are inherently more hazardous.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Project 24502422].Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02310 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find the “death of distance” in venture capital (VC) investment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: VCs invest in more distant startups during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and such effects continue after the economy reopens. The death of distance is more pronounced when there is better internet infrastructure, lower information asymmetry between VCs and entrepreneurs, and smaller deal size. The pandemic-spurred advancement and adoption of remote communication technology contribute to the documented observations. The death of distance in VC investment implies more vibrant entry of outside VCs into geographically localized markets, intensified competition among VCs, and mitigated regional inequality of entrepreneurial access to VC financing.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: P.

    <title>Do Professional Rankings Affect Analyst Behavior? Evidence From a Regression Discontinuity Design</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how winning a significant industry award affects the behavior of finance professionals. Focusing on sell-side equity analysts and utilizing a novel data set from Institutional Investor on analyst rankings, we employ a regression discontinuity design that compares the postaward research outputs and behavior of third-place, all-star analysts with those of first runner-up analysts who barely miss the distinction. Our results show that third-place all-star winners are more optimistic in their forecasts and recommendations compared with first runner-up analysts after winning the award, and market reactions to their forecast revisions are stronger. The third-place winners also receive higher priority during earnings conference calls and experience better career outcomes. Our evidence is consistent with award-winning analysts leveraging their increased reputation and market influence to generate more trading commissions and career benefits. The broader inference of our findings is that finance professionals who win a significant award are likely to become more, rather than less, strategic.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04249 .</content>

    <title>Competitive Dynamics in the Political Marketplace: How Donor Firms’ Political Wins Prompt Product-Market Peers to Appoint Politicians to Their Boards</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a regression discontinuity design in a sample of U.S. federal special elections, we investigate how donor firms’ political wins impact the adaptive responses of their product-market peers in their political activities, with a particular focus on the appointment of politicians to their boardrooms. By analyzing closely contested special elections, we find that when donor firms had donated to a candidate who narrowly won a special election, their peer firms were 41% more likely to appoint politicians to their boards in the following year than peers of the donor firms that had supported a narrowly defeated candidate. This adaptive response is more pronounced among peer firms facing greater political risks and operating in industries with more intense competition for government sales. Donor firms’ political wins also lead peer firms to increase their product differentiation from those donor firms. We interpret these patterns as evidence of a competitive-dynamics mechanism, where peer firms perceive donor firms’ political wins as a threat that could disadvantage them in the regulatory environment, prompting them to strengthen their boards with political capital to navigate potential regulatory changes and mitigate perceived risks. Our findings enrich scholarly understandings of corporate political activities and director selections.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: Z.

    <title>Ultra-Fresh Fashion: Creating Demand with Freshness and Agility</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using agile supply chains, fast fashion companies have been viewed as best practice examples in industries. Prior research focuses on how agility can equip such companies with strong sense-and-respond capabilities to identify and fulfill unpredictable customer demands. There is another powerful dimension of agility—the ability to create new products frequently—that has enabled recent market success of companies such as Shein and Temu, labeled by some industry press as ultra-fast fashion. These companies, relying on end-to-end digital technologies, have pushed this dimension of agility to unprecedentedly high levels, launching new products with great frequency and variety. The frequent product launches create freshness, stimulating latent demands of consumers and making these companies “ultra-fresh” fashion, a term we adopt in this paper. We seek to model this dimension of agility as an operational strategy for demand creation. Our model enables us to explore the effects through the lens of profit to the firm, consumer surplus, and environmental impact. Our analysis reveals that frequent product launches, high variety, and low prices—the three salient features of ultra-fresh fashion—are driven by both the product design agility and the customers’ interest for product freshness. The ultra-fresh strategy allows steady profit increase for the firm and benefits consumers in aggregate but may cause negative environmental impact if left unchecked.This paper was accepted by Jay Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06249 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use newly assembled data overall encompassing up to 75 countries and starting circa 1910, to study impediments to the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction as it “proceeds by competitively destroying old businesses.” Political connections appear to represent an obstacle to the destructive part of the Schumpeterian process in the replacement of large firms. When accompanied by regulations that restrict entry, political connections can play a role in allowing large firms to remain large. When connected to Fogel, Morck, and Yeung (2008,Journal of Financial Economics89, 83–108), the results imply that political connections, combined with barriers to entry, can retard economic development.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Reducing Visibility of Friends’ Liked Content on User Content Engagement Across Newsfeed Channels</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nowadays, online platforms constantly adjust their newsfeeds to boost engagement, often emphasizing nonsocial channels such as algorithmic recommendations over social ones such as user networks. However, ignoring the interactions between these channels can have unintended consequences. This study delves into this by assessing the impacts of a policy change that reduced the visibility of friends’ liked content on a major discussion platform. We found this led to an overall decrease in users’ content engagement. Although users engaged more with their friends’ original posts and trending topics, their interaction with nonsocial content such as algorithmic recommendations decreased. This reveals a key insight: social channels act as substitutes for one another but are complementary to nonsocial, algorithmic channels. Vibrant social activity is crucial for driving traffic to other parts of a platform. Crucially, the change also made users’ content engagement less diverse. Friends’ liked content is a key source of exposure to niche topics. For platform operators, this means that sidelining social features in favor of algorithmic feeds can backfire, reducing overall engagement and diversity. For policymakers concerned about online echo chambers, our findings suggest that content shared through extended social networks is vital for promoting a wider range of content.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use unique disclosures in the insurance industry to examine whether client-engaged specialists (i.e., external actuaries) affect opportunism within the claim loss reserve. Using a fixed-effects approach, we find that external actuaries significantly affect the opportunism in the claim loss reserve, approaching half the effect of the auditor. With respect to actuary characteristics, we find a positive (negative) association between actuary permissiveness (actuary size) and opportunism in the claim loss reserve. In additional analyses, we find that the relation between actuary permissiveness and claim loss reserve opportunism is stronger when insurers have incentives to opportunistically manage the claim loss reserve. This relation continues to persist in the presence of high-quality auditors. Overall, we provide evidence suggesting that client-engaged external actuaries can be used to support opportunistic claim loss reserve estimates.</content>

    <title>When Do Gender-Diverse Teams Engage More Investors? Evidence of Threshold Alignment Benefits at Techstars</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through an observational field study involving quantitative and qualitative components, we explore the role of gender diversity in shaping the effectiveness of mentorship for founder teams seeking investors. Data on 984 teams of founders assigned to teams of mentors at Techstars-run accelerator programs around the world demonstrate the interteam benefits of aligned gender diversity thresholds: Founder teams characterized by the presence (absence) of gender diversity engage more investors when matched with mentor teams also characterized by the presence (absence) of gender diversity. Neither the presence of gender diversity in the founder team nor the presence of gender diversity in the mentor team exerts a positive influence on investor counts as a standalone factor, but the aligned presence of intrateam gender diversity helps ventures maximize participating investors. We find that the number of participating investors has a positive downstream impact, increasing the amount of funding that the venture raises. Results are robust to the inclusion of controls for venture, founder, and mentor characteristics, with clustering at the Techstars cohort level. Qualitative insights from 20 semistructured interviews reveal how interteam gender alignment facilitates interpersonal attraction, whereas intrateam gender diversity enables resource acquisition. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this phenomenon for internal-external team interactions in venture funding and beyond.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2025.20141 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating Fairness into Online Price DiscriminationIn the paper “Fairness-aware online price discrimination with nonparametric demand models,” Xi Chen, Jiameng Lyu, Xuan Zhang, and Yuan Zhou explore how fairness can be integrated into dynamic pricing strategies. The authors propose a model that enforces price fairness constraints, ensuring that price differences between customer groups remain within a specified range. Their approach introduces a novel regret lower bound, which contrasts with the typical regret seen in traditional pricing algorithms. This shift underscores the added complexity of optimizing revenue while maintaining fairness. The study not only advances the understanding of fairness-aware dynamic pricing but also enriches the dynamic pricing literature by offering new lower-bound techniques. These insights may be useful for deriving lower bounds in other problems related to learning optimal prices under constraints. Their work contributes significantly to the growing need for ethical pricing practices in data-driven markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two Prices Unlock Big Gains for Reusable ResourcesHow much sophistication is needed to price reusable resources, like hotel rooms and cloud computing, when usage durations are not memoryless? Surprisingly little. In “Dynamic Pricing for Reusable Resources: The Power of Two Prices,” Balseiro, Ma, and Zhang propose a class of dynamic stock-dependent policies that achieve significant improvements over static pricing by only looking at how many units are busy and ignoring how long they have been busy. Using an “insensitivity” property of loss networks, they show that optimizing within this policy class can be formulated as a tractable convex optimization problem. Better yet, the performance loss of the optimal stock-dependent policy can be achieved by a simple two-price policy: charge a high price when inventory falls below a threshold and a low price otherwise. Extensions to multiple resources and customer classes, together with extensive simulations, confirm that “just a little” dynamicity can go a long way.</content>

    <title>Mass Vaccination Scheduling: Trading Off Infections, Throughput, and Overtime</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mass vaccination is essential for epidemic control, but long queues can increase infection risk. We study how to schedule arrivals at a mass vaccination center to minimize a tri-objective function of (a) the expected number of infections acquired while waiting, (b) throughput, and (c) overtime. Leveraging multimodularity results of a related optimization problem, we construct a solution algorithm and apply it to a case study of COVID-19. We find that although the standard equally distributed, equally spaced schedule sits near the Pareto-optimal frontier, it is located away from a sharp elbow in the tradeoff between infections and overtime. Specifically, the “elbow policy” achieves approximately 38% fewer expected infections for nearly the same expected overtime. We also discuss managerial insights around the structure of the optimal schedule and compare it to the well-known “dome-shaped” policies found in other appointment scheduling settings.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02958 .</content>

    <title>On‐Demand Schedules, Worker Absenteeism and Patient Dissatisfaction in Home Care Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service companies often adopt on‐demand scheduling to balance labor costs and fluctuating market demand. However, research shows that such practices can reduce worker productivity and retention. In this study, we examine how on‐demand scheduling affects two critical outcomes: worker absenteeism and patient dissatisfaction. We extend the conceptualization of undesirable scheduling by introducingschedule discontinuity—the presence of unpaid interruptions within a worker's daily schedule—alongside the more commonly studiedschedule inconsistency, or variability in work hours across weeks. Using data on 1.2 million home care visits in a Canadian healthcare provider, we find that both schedule inconsistency and discontinuity significantly increase absenteeism and patient dissatisfaction. Specifically, moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in discontinuity (inconsistency) raises absenteeism by 20.00% (19.29%), and customer complaints by 27.33% (40.27%). To assess the practical implications for employers, we formulate and solve a schedule optimization problem that minimizes schedule discontinuity (or inconsistency), while satisfying demand and supply constraints. Applying a machine learning predictive model to these optimized schedules, we estimate reductions in the probability of absenteeism by 9.5% (8.2%) and in the probability of patient complaints by 7.7% (2.3%), demonstrating that modest scheduling adjustments can substantially improve worker and service outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a pricing kernel with time-varying volatility risk aversion to explain the observed time variations in the shape of the pricing kernel. When combined with the Heston-Nandi GARCH model, this framework yields a tractable option pricing model in which the variance risk ratio (VRR) emerges as a key variable. We show that the VRR is closely linked to economic fundamentals, as well as sentiment and uncertainty measures. A novel approximation method provides analytical option pricing formulas, and we demonstrate substantial reductions in pricing errors through an empirical application to the S&amp;P 500 index, the CBOE VIX, and option prices.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating Expert Views into Investment ModelsHow can investors best incorporate forward-looking expert views into dynamic portfolio strategies? “Dynamic Black-Litterman,” by Anas Abdelhakmi and Andrew Lim, offers a novel solution.The authors generalize the classic Black-Litterman model to a dynamic setting, allowing for continuous trading and expert views of events over varying time horizons that arrive over time. They derive the explicit dynamics of asset prices after incorporating these views, uncovering a surprising and elegant connection to multidimensional Brownian bridges.Remarkably, the paper provides a closed-form solution for the optimal dynamic portfolio policy, a significant finding for a model of this complexity. This includes a specific hedging component to protect against changes in expert views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach consistently outperforms strategies that repeatedly apply the single-period model, leading to higher returns and lower portfolio turnover.</content>

    <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Day-ahead electricity auctions allow market participants to trade power for delivery the following day. In Europe, these auctions are designed as combinatorial auctions, enabling agents to submit package bids (“block bids”) that span multiple time periods rather than bidding separately for each hour. However, power exchanges impose limits on the number of package bids an agent can submit, creating a complex decision problem: Which packages should an agent bid on to best represent their preferences? In “Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives,” Hübner and Hug study this selection problem and propose decision-support algorithms that optimize bid choice under uncertainty. They provide theoretical bounds on welfare loss due to bid limits and validate their methods with simulations involving generators, storage systems, and flexible demand. Their findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and bidders.</content>

    <title>Balancing External vs. Internal Validity: An Application of Causal Forest in Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Answering causal questions with generalizable results is challenging. Estimators requiring pseudorandomization provide estimates with no bias (i.e., strong internal validity) but limited generalizability (i.e., weak external validity). Theoretically, causal forest, a nonparametric, machine learning–based matching estimator, can provide low-to-no-bias, generalizable estimates even when treatment is endogenous. We empirically compare the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS), regression discontinuity design (RDD), and causal forest at recovering estimates in simulated observational panel data and show the robustness of causal forest estimates to many sources of bias. We revisit a popular RDD setting, debt covenant default, to show how extendable, heterogeneous causal forest estimates can enhance inferences.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00109 .</content>

    <title>Optimal Integration: Human, Machine, and Generative AI</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the optimal integration of humans and technologies in multilayered decision-making processes. When each layer can correct existing errors but may also introduce new errors, who should have the final authority? I show that a decision maker’s correction capability normalized by its new errors is a one-dimensional quality metric that determines the optimal rule: deploying higher quality technologies in later stages. Intriguingly, despite its highest quality, the final layer may not generate the greatest error reduction; instead, its role hinges on minimizing new errors. Human effort varies asymmetrically across layers: early stages exert relatively lower effort and prioritize error correction, whereas later stages exert higher effort and focus on avoiding new errors. Applying the model to artificial intelligence (AI) reveals that AI’s generative capabilities make it more likely to serve as the final decision maker, reducing the need for costly human input at the risks of AI hallucination. The theoretical framework also extends to applications including repeated delegation, automation design, loan screening, tenure review, and other multilayer decision-making scenarios.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.</content>

    <title>How Causal Focus and Specificity in Risk Factor Disclosures Jointly Affect Investor Judgments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how investors’ investment judgments are jointly affected by two important linguistic features that vary considerably across firms’ risk factor disclosures: namely, causal focus—the extent to which managers’ disclosures focus on the causes versus consequences of risk events—and specificity, which refers to specific references to names of objects and quantitative values. Results of controlled experiments show that, when the disclosure focus is on risk causes, greater specificity increases investment willingness because of enhanced feelings of knowable uncertainty in a risk event. In contrast, when the focus is on risk consequences, greater specificity reduces investment willingness because of diminished feelings of knowable uncertainty. Contrary to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positive view of specific risk factor disclosures, our results suggest that specificity can have an opposite effects on investors’ judgments depending on the causal focus of risk factor disclosures.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by Korea University Business School and the United Overseas Bank Professorship Endowment Fund.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00445 .</content>

    <title>Cut to the Curve: Underrecognition and Talent Loss from Forced Ranking in a Multinational Firm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines unintended consequences of enforcing a curve on performance rankings. I examine a multinational company where some employees are downgraded from the top levels of rankings due to a strict recognition cutoff. I show that downgraded employees are at least 34% more likely to voluntarily exit, and that attempts by the organization to manage employee concerns, particularly regarding concerns of fairness, envy, and self-image, do not have the intended retention effect. Underrecognized employees leave even though the organization avoids calibration bias, offers reassurance about their career prospects, and compensates them with larger bonuses than their top-ranked peers. In robustness checks, I show that under these conditions even high-performing employees not nominated to the top ranks are more likely to voluntarily depart despite receiving the largest bonuses. These findings suggest that, where underrecognition occurs due to the restriction of top rankings, the mechanisms producing demotivation are more powerful than the management strategies meant to combat them.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01204 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on a comprehensive data set of classified (staggered) boards covering nearly all U.S. public firms from 1991 to 2020, we show that contrary to conventional wisdom, the use of classified boards remains widespread. Moreover, classified board usage over a firm's life cycle depends significantly on the decade the firm matured or year it went public. While classified boards were rarely removed in the 1990s, firms became more likely to declassify as they matured during the following decades. Decreased collective action costs and increased innovation‐related investments, institutional ownership, and scrutiny of governance contributed to this more dynamic adjustment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new measure of firms' disclosure based on company websites, which are widely available and contain a wealth of information. For a sample of U.S. public firms, we construct our disclosure measure using historical website data, validate it by correlating it with extant measures of disclosure and information asymmetry, and explore its determinants. We then apply our measure to the study of U.S. private firms' disclosure and French firms' compliance with a nonfinancial disclosure mandate. Our applications illustrate that our website‐based measure provides a useful complement to extant measures of disclosure, which are more narrowly focused on investors in public capital markets.</content>

    <title>Sponsored Tasks and Solver Participation in Crowdsourcing Contests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing platforms provide venues for firms looking for solutions (seekers) to interact with individuals who can provide solutions (solvers). As crowdsourcing contest platforms have grown in popularity, with numerous tasks being posted on a daily basis, a concern that has emerged is that many similar tasks compete for solver attention, with some tasks failing to attract sufficient solver participation. To alleviate this concern, in addition to regular task listings, many crowdsourcing platforms offer sponsorship programs under which seekers pay an extra fee for highlighting their tasks to draw solvers’ attention. We examine the effect of sponsorship on solver participation using a unique data set collected from a leading crowdsourcing platform. In contrast to platforms’ claims about the effect of sponsorship on participation, we find that sponsorship does not always boost participation in crowdsourcing contests; sponsorship increases the number of participants only when the task’s prize amount is already high. Furthermore, even when the number of participants increases, the increase comes primarily from low-ability solvers. We also find that when sponsorship increases the total number of submissions, it does so only by increasing the number of participants; sponsorship does not increase the number of submissions that individual solvers submit after joining a task. More granular analyses reveal an effect of anticipated increased competition caused by sponsorship on high-ability solvers that is not observed on those of low ability, explaining the difference in their participation decisions when facing sponsored tasks. We also find that the effect of sponsorship weakens over the duration of a task for high-ability solvers and is also weaker for solvers with more experience on the platform.History: Yong Tan, Senior Editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2021.0246 .</content>

    <title>No margin, no mission? How emergency medical service crews attend to competing financial and social goals on 9‐1‐1 calls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how autonomous Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams prioritize competing financial and social goals during 9‐1‐1 calls. Prior research highlights organization‐level solutions that enable single‐goal pursuit, but it remains unclear how frontline professionals manage competing goals that are interdependent and inseparable during task execution. We argue EMS teams will dynamically prioritize goals across calls depending on contextual factors. Using quasi‐random assignment of 9‐1‐1 patients to EMS crews in 31 US states, we find that crews prioritize the financial goal on private insurance calls but shift toward the social goal when agency financial need is low or call acuity is high. Surprisingly, these patterns are most pronounced in non‐profit EMS agencies. Our study offers new insight into how professionals manage goal trade‐offs in real time.Managerial SummaryWhat happens when professionals must pursue competing goals—like financial performance and equitable service—but organizations cannot separate them across tasks? Using data from 31 US states, we examine how Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams navigate this tension during 9‐1‐1 calls. We find that crews dynamically prioritize goals based on perceived risk and opportunity—even without managerial intervention or immediate incentives. Teams provide more services to privately insured patients to increase revenue but shift toward equitable care when patient needs are more urgent or agency finances are stable. Surprisingly, these trade‐offs are most pronounced in non‐profit agencies. Our findings suggest that when goals collide within tasks, managers can shape frontline decision‐making by influencing how professionals understand goal risk and opportunity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock returns exhibit reversals at short horizons but slowly transition to momentum over longer horizons. To help understand this pattern, we develop a multiperiod model with short- and long-horizon noise traders, and active investors who underreact to information they do not themselves produce. The model accords with the transition from reversals to momentum and yields the following novel predictions: (a) attenuated reversals after earnings announcements, (b) a negative relation between monthly reversal and longer-term momentum profits across economies and time, and (c) larger reversals when there is more noise trading. Empirical analysis using U.S. and international data supports these predictions. (JEL G12, G14, G41)</content>

    <title>The Confirmation Nudge: Prompts to Change or Confirm Initial Preferences Steer Consumer Choice</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Across two field experiments and several pre-registered laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that confirmation nudges, which ask consumers whether they would like to confirm or change their initial choice, impact choice. First, consumers navigating a subscription company’s smartphone app were randomized to a control or confirmation nudge condition, which asked them to either confirm their initial choice or switch to an annual subscription. Confirmation nudges increased subscribers’ choice of the annual subscription by over 8 percentage points–an effect size similar to default effects tested by the same company. In Experiment 2, conducted by a jewelry retailer, confirmation nudges had countervailing effects, increasing purchases of a nudged service plan add-on, but decreasing originally-planned jewelry purchases likely because it added a step and thus frictions to the purchase process. Confirmation nudges had larger effects when nudged options were desirable and among consumers who would benefit from the nudge (Experiments 3-4). But, they were perceived as more manipulative than comparison conditions (Experiment 5). We suggest that confirmation nudges undo tendencies to focus on initially-preferred options, shifting attention towards alternatives relative to control conditions. Consistent with this, confirmation nudges were especially effective when the wording of the confirmation prompt focused on the “switch” option.</content>

    <title>Is There Fairness in AI?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly steer workplace decisions, debates around fairness have intensified. Existing research often approaches fairness either as a set of universal principles supported or undermined by algorithms, or as a product of social interpretations, thereby providing either technologically deterministic or purely social accounts. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a human resources (HR) department of a large international company that introduced AI in hiring, this study offers an alternative view that shifts focus to how fairness emerges through the ways people define, embed, and perform values with algorithms. Taking a sociomaterial perspective, we find that the introduction and use of AI resulted in crowding out expert practices of performing fairness, favouring instead the version performed by HR. Our process model explains this outcome by the growing symbiosis between HR's professional mandate for fairness and AI procedures, where each legitimizes, shapes, and protects the other over time. This study thus shows that fairness is not pre‐given but constantly redefined and enacted through evolving associations between professional mandates and AI technologies.</content>

    <title>Not All Political Ties Are the Same: Firms’ Ties to the Government and Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complementing research on the implications of political ties for firms’ strategic decisions and financial performance, recent studies are increasingly focusing on the environmental consequences of firms’ political connections. We contribute to this stream of work by integrating insights from the literature on political ties and the multifaceted nature of governments to explore how the level of government influences the pollution implications of firms’ political ties. Specifically, we theorize and demonstrate that, in China, firms’ achieved political ties with high levels of the government reduce pollution, while such ties with low levels of the government increase it. Furthermore, we examine how these relationships are moderated by firm owners’ social class and the attention by different levels of the government to their respective primary goals. Our analysis of data from 6,758 privately-owned Chinese enterprises provides support for our predictions. Our main conceptual contribution is to add more nuance to the research on political ties by highlighting the contingent role of the level of government in shaping firms’ pollution outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on performance feedback presents conflicting views on how above‐aspiration performance influences organizational change. Some studies argue that it constrains change due to a lack of organizational motivation, while others suggest that it enables change by expanding managerial discretion. Reconciling these perspectives, we suggest that managers’ narcissistic tendencies can fundamentally alter how a firm responds to above‐aspiration performance. We theorize and find evidence that high‐narcissism CEOs respond to above‐aspiration performance with more acquisitions—attention‐generating actions that align with their self‐enhancement motives, while under similar conditions low‐narcissism CEOs avoid acquisitions, due to their uncertainty and risk. Our findings highlight the interplay between managerial discretion and personal motivations in shaping strategic responses to performance feedback, offering new insights into the role of executive personality in corporate decision‐making.Managerial SummaryDo successful firms pursue bold strategic moves—or play it safe when firm performance is strong? Our study seeks to answer this question and reconcile conflicting findings about how above‐aspiration performance influences managers’ decisions to undertake risky organizational change, such as corporate acquisitions. We show that it depends on CEO narcissism. High‐narcissism CEOs—who seek attention, hold an inflated self‐view, and are more egoistic—are motivated to initiate bold, high‐risk changes like acquisitions. In contrast, low‐narcissism CEOs—who avoid challenging tasks, hold a modest self‐view, and are sensitive to negative evaluation—are motivated to avoid bold, high‐risk changes like acquisitions. By showing how CEO narcissism affects firms’ risky change actions, we offer new insights into the role of executive personality in corporate decision‐making.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Breaking Barriers: Improving Patient Adherence to Appointments and Provider Productivity through Telehealth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Telehealth services became popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet their operational impacts on healthcare organizations are not well-understood. Patient behaviors can vary significantly between telehealth and in-person appointments, introducing new challenges and opportunities for healthcare delivery. We examine two key behaviors contributing to non-adherence to medical appointments: no-shows and unpunctuality. Analyzing 412,415 telehealth and inperson appointments across a major US medical system from 2020 to 2022, we find that telehealth appointments reduce no-shows by 3.0 percentage points (23.1%) and late-arrivals by 11.4 percentage points (35.6%), indicating significant improvements in appointment adherence. We also find that telehealth is particularly effective in improving adherence to follow-up appointments but may be less suitable for initial consultations with new patients. In addition, telehealth improves adherence most among demographic groups with historically lower in-person attendance – women, racial minorities, Medicaid patients, and younger adults – underscoring its potential to reduce disparities in access. Our analysis suggests that while telehealth may increase patient revisit rates and create extra work for providers, the gains from reduced no-shows, particularly for follow-ups, lead to a net boost in provider productivity. Finally, we explore the best strategies to integrate telehealth into a provider’s daily scheduling template, showing that scheduling telehealth appointments before in-person visits enhances operational efficiency compared to the opposite sequence. Policymakers should recognize telehealth’s capacity to improve appointment adherence, reduce disparities, and enhance productivity, and support its adoption through appropriate regulations. Healthcare organizations should strategically deploy telehealth to address the root causes of patient non-adherence. By offering telehealth appointments to patients facing barriers to in-person care, they can simultaneously optimize both access and productivity.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Global Sourcing for Supply Resilience in the Presence of Emergency Contract Renegotiation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In light of the recent frequency of global emergencies that result in overseas delivery delays and cost surges, many multinational brands consider reshaping their sourcing configurations by incorporating local suppliers that may be of lower quality than globally selected counterparts. In this global context, pre-committed emergency renegotiation clauses have gained recognition as a common practice in international commercial contracts, which enable contractual parties to adjust key terms, such as the wholesale price and order quantity, during ex-post emergencies. This work aims to investigate how the presence of overseas emergency renegotiation affects the brand’s strategy preference for dual versus single sourcing and the decision-making of supply chain parties. By comparing with two widely observed benchmark scenarios—contract termination and contract continuation at post-recovery cost—that exclude overseas emergency renegotiation, we show that in the presence of emergency renegotiation, the overseas supplier under both sourcing strategies may lower its wholesale price for the brand in response to a higher delay probability, which would not be the case in the contract termination benchmark. This price-cutting effect encourages the brand to order more from the overseas supplier, even if the delay probability is high. Furthermore, the brand favors dual sourcing if the overseas post-recovery unit cost is either low or high, driven by a distinct incentive under renegotiation: the local supplier may suppress the local rival by setting a high wholesale price, a scenario not possible in the contract continuation benchmark. Our study highlights the value of emergency contract renegotiation in reshaping resilient sourcing strategies for multinational brands facing global emergencies, even with ex-post local reorder or overseas quality deterioration during recovery.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The placement of facilities in service regions with continuously distributed demand poses a difficult problem, often requiring discretization methods that can potentially introduce approximation errors. This study presents a robust approach to address this challenge of continuous spatial distribution by considering the problem of facility placement under the spatial uncertainty associated with future demand locations, without resorting to discretization and its associated errors. We propose a spatial-data-driven optimization approach to deal with the key challenges, namely the continuous region of potential demands, sparse historical demands, and non-stationarity of the spatial distribution of demands. To this end, we model the spatial uncertainty using a Wasserstein distance based spatial ambiguity set, wherein we leverage popular clustering algorithms to form subregions to explicitly capture the spatial structure of demand occurrences. This proposed spatial ambiguity set does not require the discretization and demand aggregation approach commonly employed in the literature, while still maintaining the optimization tractability. Following a distributionally robust optimization framework with the proposed spatial ambiguity set, the problem is reformulated as a mixed integer semi-infinite optimization problem, which is then solved by our row-and-column generation algorithm. To study the practical performance, we conduct a numerical study in the emergency response context with the real data of fatal road traffic accidents in the city of Leeds, UK. Numerical results suggest that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks and attains facility locations that can potentially provide shorter response times to future demand occurrences. In particular, our proposed approach attains an out-of-sample performance improvement of 7–9% over the sample average approximation approach and an improvement of 5–8% over the discretization and demand aggregation approach under higher future spatial uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic Servers with Individual Preferences in Heavy TrafficAgents in service systems are known to strategically adjust their service speeds to maximize idle time. “Many-Server Queueing Systems with Heterogeneous Strategic Servers in Heavy Traffic” by Büke, dos Reis, and Platonov is the first work to rigorously examine strategic heterogeneous servers in queueing systems. The authors address this technically challenging problem using a novel asymptotic framework that provides valuable insights into equilibrium behavior. The analysis goes beyond existing literature by incorporating a remarkably general class of utility functions and routing policies, allowing for variation in agents’ marginal utility of idleness. One of the key results shows that the celebrated square-root staffing rule retains its optimality—even in the presence of strategic behavior—when agents are sufficiently averse to low levels of idleness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sponsors of corporate defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the United States transferred $155 billion pension obligations to insurance companies between 2012 and 2022. These pension risk transfers (PRTs) reduced the pool of corporate DB plan participants by 12% and are a huge business for the involved insurers. We assemble a new PRT database and highlight three features of PRTs: (i) the burden associated with mandatory Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insurance premiums drives PRT activity; (ii) using an upper bound measure for the impact of PRTs, we estimate that the average sponsor reduces its pension obligations and plan participants by 22% and 27%, respectively. These large reductions are mainly because of the transfer of retired plan participants to insurance companies. (iii) Plan sponsors that conduct PRTs have less default risk and less volatile pension assets even after conducting the PRTs. Hence, PRTs increase the risk of the remaining PBGC pool.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S.

    <title>My Advisor, Her AI, and Me: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Human–AI Collaboration and Investment Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid ongoing policy and managerial debates on keeping humans in the loop of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making processes, we investigate whether human involvement in AI-based service production benefits downstream consumers. Partnering with a large savings bank in Europe, we produced pure AI and human–AI collaborative investment advice, which we passed to the bank customers and investigated the degree of their advice taking in a field experiment. On the production side, contrary to concerns that humans might inefficiently override AI output, our findings show that having a human banker in the loop of AI-based financial advisory by giving her the final say over the advice provided does not compromise the quality of the advice. More importantly, on the consumption side, we find that the bank customers are more likely to align their final investment decisions with advice from the human–AI collaboration, compared with pure AI, especially when facing more risky investments. In our setting, this increased reliance on human–AI collaborative advice leads to higher material welfare for consumers. Additional analyses from the field experiment along with an online controlled experiment indicate that the persuasive efficacy of human–AI collaborative advice cannot be attributed to consumers’ belief in increased advice quality resulting from complementarities between human and AI capabilities. Instead, the consumption-side benefits of human involvement in the AI-based service largely stem from human involvement serving as a peripheral cue that enhances the affective appeal of the advice. Our findings indicate that regulations and guidelines should adopt a consumer-centric approach by fostering environments where human capabilities and AI systems can synergize effectively to benefit consumers while safeguarding consumer welfare. These nuanced insights are crucial for managers who face decisions about offering pure AI versus human–AI collaborative services and also for regulators advocating for having humans in the loop.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Designing Layouts for Sequential Experiences: Application to Cultural Institutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A fundamental issue faced by experience providers—ranging from retail to culture—is displaying a collection of items for physical and digital interactions. The arrangement of the exhibits in different locations, which we call the layout, affects the visitors’ choices over time and space, thereby driving their engagement with the offered experience. In a collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum (Netherlands), we develop a predict-then-optimize framework to inform such operational decisions. First, we propose a sequential choice model, called pathway multinomial logit, that represents visitor activity as a sequence of conditional logit outcomes influenced by the layout. Estimation on large-scale visitor activity logs recorded on multimedia guides reveals that increase in spatial distances and search distances on the multimedia guide interface are strongly correlated with a reduction of transition propensity between artworks, while also uncovering relationships with artwork characteristics and contextual features. Counterintuitively, in response to more congestion, visitors may interact with more exhibits, including less prominent artworks. Our model predicts the next visitor transition with an out-of-sample accuracy of 63%. We test the predictive accuracy of our model against several benchmarks and modified layouts. Finally, we formulate the layout optimization problem, where the goal is to assign artworks to different locations to maximize the expected length of visitors’ paths. We establish a strong inapproximability result for this new optimization setting. Our simulations suggest that optimized layouts might lift visitor engagement by improving proximity and retention exerted by the layout.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: A.

    <title>Adaptive Data Acquisition for Personalized Recommendations with Optimality Guarantees on Short-Form Video Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent surge in the popularity of short-form video (SFV) on digital platforms has led to massive numbers of videos and ever-evolving topics. As a result, the task of making personalized recommendations has become increasingly challenging. We introduce a new pure exploration problem on SFV platforms: finding a ([Formula: see text])-optimal set that includes all recommendations within the [Formula: see text]-optimality gap and that excludes those beyond the [Formula: see text]-optimality gap relative to the best arm with a capacity limit of K. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm called adaptive acquisition tree (AAT). AAT jointly accounts for user preference heterogeneity and high-dimensional product characteristics. It adaptively segments users and then, learns a personalized transductive policy that can be used on partially observed or even unobserved card types to accommodate the dynamic trends on SFV platforms. We derive the sample complexity required to identify a [Formula: see text]-optimal set. Our method’s efficiency is validated through numerical tests using data from the NetEase platform. Our results reveal that the proposed policy performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art benchmarks across four transductive scenarios for both spotlight recommendations (i.e., best-arm identifications) and [Formula: see text]-optimal set recommendations. Compared with the best benchmarks for the best card and [Formula: see text]-optimal set recommendations, our approach can elevate the average rewards (measured by view time) by 30% (to 100%) and 43% (to 56%), respectively. Given the increasing popularity and uniqueness of SFVs and more broadly, user-generated content, our method offers significant academic and practical merit.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For some types of goods, rarity itself is valued: items considered “fashionable” are demanded in part because they are unique. In this paper, we explore the economics of rare goods using auctions of limited-edition shoes held by an e-commerce platform. We model endogenous entry and bidding in multiunit auctions and construct demand curves from realized bids. We find that doubling inventory reduces willingness to pay by 8%–15%. From the monopolist’s perspective, ignoring the value of rarity leads to substantial overproduction: Auctioned quantities are 88% above the profit-maximizing level. From the consumers’ perspective, however, the negative spillovers from quantity restriction more than offset the benefits of rarer goods.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04995 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women remain underrepresented not only as startup founders but also as nonfounding employees (“joiners”). Yet there is limited understanding of how to address this disparity. Whereas traditional explanations have emphasized individual employment preferences, we shift the focus to employers’ decision making. We propose that weaker employment protection—which reduces termination costs—increases women’s likelihood relative to men of being hired by startups rather than incumbent firms, as it enhances employers’ flexibility to experiment with traditionally overlooked candidates. We further hypothesize that this effect is less pronounced when information cues counteract stereotypical beliefs about women hires, such as when (a) women have experience as founders, or (b) the focal startup operates in an industry with a higher representation of female employees or female startup employees. Using Portuguese registry data on new hires from 2009 to 2013 and a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) design, we provide empirical support for these predictions. Our study highlights gender disparities in hiring between startups and incumbent firms and shows that weaker employment protection can help reduce this gender gap.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: R.

    <title>Capital Structure Effects Associated with the New Lease Accounting Standard</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study finds that the requirement of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 for firms to capitalize operating leases in financial statements beginning in 2019 resulted in firms affected by the standard reducing the reliance on existing debt (debt not associated with the capitalization of operating leases) by 7%–10% on average relative to unaffected firms. We find that firms with greater operating lease capitalization as a result of implementation of ASC 842 have the largest reductions in the reliance on existing debt. In addition, the relative decrease in existing debt associated with adoption of the standard is concentrated among firms whose debt contracts are less likely to be based on a fixed set of accounting standards, those with a higher likelihood of violating loan covenants, and those whose capital structures are more affected by the standard relative to other firms in their industry. Taken together, these findings suggest that contracting costs play a significant role in firms’ relative decrease in existing debt following implementation of ASC 842. Much of the related literature on ASC 842 documents efforts to reduce the impact of the lease standard prior to adoption. In contrast, our findings suggest that firms were unable to offset completely the increased leverage effects from the adoption of the standard, resulting in affected firms additionally reducing their reliance on existing debt.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04447 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As AI-powered negotiations spread, their psychological and relational impact remains unclear. We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that trains a bot to aim for superior economic outcomes while appearing “human” (“algorithmic anthropomorphization”). In a bargaining game experiment, we compare this “superhuman” bot to two simpler alternatives: a bot that mimics human behavior and a purely efficient bot. Our results show that (a) superficial anthropomorphization can make a bot seem human but does not improve subjective evaluations, (b) the efficient bot is so rational it is easily exploited, undercutting its performance, and (c) the superhuman bot achieves superior economic results while appearing more human than actual humans. Yet even when bots act indistinguishably from humans, they may trigger an “uncanny valley” effect, lowering subjective evaluations regardless of performance. Because subjective evaluations predict future negotiation outcomes, these findings highlight the potential negative impact AI bargaining algorithms can have on long-term customer relationships. We urge firms to measure more than objective outcomes when assessing AI negotiators.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multiple Unit Offers and Rate Calculations: How Rates Influence Price and Promotion Sensitivity</title>
    <updated>2025-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers are often faced with multiple unit offers (e.g., $40 for 5 lbs of coffee) in the marketplace and must figure out how to evaluate them. While the total price (e.g., $40) is always provided, the associated rate information is not (e.g., $8/lb for coffee). The focus of this research is on understanding the role that these rates play in influencing consumer decision-making. The authors find that regardless of whether rates are provided by managers or calculated by consumers, consumers are more sensitive to promotional offers with dollar per unit (vs. unit per dollar) rates because dollar per unit rates increase price salience. Additionally, when rate information is not provided, the authors document how these rates are computed by consumers. The authors find that consumers prefer to use the larger numerosity element as their rate’s numerator, which leads to calculating units per dollar rates when the multiple unit offer’s quantity is larger in numerosity than the price but dollars per unit rates when price is larger in numerosity than the quantity. The authors discuss theoretical, practical, and policy implications.</content>

    <title>The More, the Merrier? Membership Expansion and Incumbents' Boundary Work Divergence in the Platformization of Belgian Philanthropy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When actors emerge on the periphery of a field, incumbents either engage in protective boundary work to enforce the field's membership criteria, or opt for membership expansion by adapting these criteria to accommodate peripheral actors. Less explored is the divergence configuration where a minority of incumbents pursue expansion whereas the majority adopt a protective strategy. Since the inclusion of peripheral actors may challenge membership criteria (i.e., the symbolic boundary) and shift the resource distribution and social hierarchy (i.e., the social boundary), how minority incumbents induce membership expansion against the majority's protective stance is an intriguing question. Drawing on a qualitative field‐level case study of Belgian philanthropy, we examine incumbent foundations' responses to the rise of ‘social‐mission platforms.’ We identify four mechanisms through which minority incumbents can overcome the majority's initial opposition and bring about support to membership expansion: affirming divergent expansive posture, leveraging definitional ambiguity, demonstrating comparative reinforcement, and facilitating shared buy‐in. We further show how each mechanism bridges the social and symbolic boundaries through the combined (re)actions of the diverging incumbents and the peripheral actors. Our findings extend understandings of membership expansion as a contested, multi‐actor process and unpack the interaction of social and symbolic boundaries in shaping field evolution.</content>

    <title>Pockets of Predictability: A Replication</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Farmer, Schmidt, and Timmermann (FST) document time‐variation in market return predictability, identifying “pockets” of significant predictability through kernel regressions. However, our analysis reveals a critical discrepancy between the method outlined by FST and the code actually implemented. Instead of using a one‐sided kernel, which guarantees out‐of‐sample forecasts, they perform in‐sample estimation with a two‐sided kernel. As a result, future information leaks into the forecasting model, undermining its reliability. Rectifying this error qualitatively alters the findings, invalidating most conclusions of the FST study. Thus, attempts to exploit such “pockets”—should they exist—offer little help in forecasting market returns.</content>

    <title>Fairness Perceptions in Demographic Targeting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deciding which customer segment(s) to serve, or targeting, is a cornerstone of marketing strategy. While companies commonly target based on demographic characteristics, recent cultural movements (e.g., #MeToo, Black Lives Matter) have heightened sensitivity to the differential treatment of certain demographic groups. Yet research to date has not examined whether demographic targeting itself seems fair or appropriate. Fourteen experiments (N = 9,399), 13 supplemental studies (N = 7,065), and two Facebook A/B Tests (N = 513,151) reveal that when consumers learn or infer that they or others have been targeted based on demographic characteristics, fairness perceptions and brand support suffer (relative to broad advertising). To explain why, we propose a conceptual model based on the extent to which consumers view demographic targeting as discriminatory (ie, differential treatment based on attributes that are irrelevant and/or uncontrollable), and whether the discrimination is perceived as intentional (ie, knowingly or willingly bringing about an avoidable outcome). Consequently, factors that (a) improve relevance (ie, whether belonging to the targeted segment is diagnostic of preferences) or (b) increase controllability (ie, whether consumers themselves determine their membership in the targeted segment) attenuate perceptions of unfairness, as do variables that (c) reduce perceived intentionality (e.g., firm size, industry norms).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper empirically studies the effects of the early law-and-economics movement on the U.S. judiciary. We focus on the Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges, an intensive economics course that trained almost half of federal judges between 1976 and 1999. Using the universe of published opinions in U.S. Circuit Courts and 1 million District Court criminal sentencing decisions, we estimate the within-judge effect of Manne program attendance. Selection into attendance was limited, as the program was popular among judges of all backgrounds, frequently oversubscribed, and admitted participants on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that after attending economics training, participating judges use more economics language in their opinions, rule against regulatory agencies more often, and impose more severe criminal sentences. We argue that economics, as a rigorous social science, was especially effective in persuading judges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should a large investor trade when their actions influence—and are influenced by—others in the market? This paper investigates optimal execution in financial markets where order flow is endogenous and governed by self-exciting dynamics. Market order arrivals are modeled using a Hawkes process, with intensity shaped by the trader’s own activity—capturing a feedback loop between execution and market response. The study considers both risk-neutral and risk-averse investors under market impact, deriving closed-form and semi–closed-form optimal strategies. In the risk-averse case, the solution skews execution toward earlier periods to mitigate inventory risk. The model is also extended to more general Hawkes kernels, enhancing practical applicability. The findings shed light on how sophisticated traders can minimize execution costs while accounting for the risk of being tracked in increasingly transparent markets. This work offers actionable insights for algorithmic execution under realistic microstructure dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We investigate why some firms succeed in using AI for innovation, whereas others fail, focusing on the organizational support necessary for leveraging AI in both novel and incremental innovation. Specifically, we examine how the lean startup method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping—focused on developing minimum viable products—and controlled experimentation—focused on rigorous testing such as A/B testing. We find that LSM complements discovery-oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using A/B testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high-quality products in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct because different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Consequences of Resorting to Fines and Investments to Regulate Data Portability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many jurisdictions have implemented data portability regulation (DPR) that requires that Data Controllers (DCs) enable users to download their personal data so that they can port their data to competing DCs. The intention of DPR is to return partial control of data to users, improve user choice of DCs, increase DC participation in the market, and reduce industry concentration. To achieve this, if nonmonetary corrective measures (e.g., warnings, orders to comply) to obtain portability compliance fail, then DPR allows policy-makers to impose fixed or variable (based on revenue) fines on DCs that do not comply. Additionally, policy-makers may invest to decrease compliance costs for DCs. We model this interaction as a two-stage game where in the first stage the policy-maker sets fines and makes investments. In the second stage DCs decide whether to participate in the market, and if so whether to comply with DPR. Contrary to the current regulatory objectives, we find that with partial compliance both fines and investments decrease DC participation and increase industry concentration. Comparing the use of fines and investment to achieve a predetermined level of compliance, the use of fixed fines has a smaller (larger) collateral effect on concentration (participation) than either variable fines or investment. Once all DCs that participate comply—full compliance—then additional investment increases participation. Moreover, full compliance and full participation can occur only if there is a DPR-induced demand expansion, such as from multihoming, and investment is the only instrument that can attain this outcome.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN/06571-2015]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2022-0460].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08404 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a search and bargaining model of over‐the‐counter markets for nonstandardized assets of heterogeneous quality. Once matched, investors privately learn their values positively correlated with asset quality. Bargaining results in delay that is hump‐shaped in quality and U‐shaped in asset turnover. We document these patterns in commercial real estate and corporate bonds markets. Extreme qualities are little affected by changes in asset standardization, while intermediate qualities are more susceptible. For nonstandardized assets, opacity ensures active trading of all assets, which explains why their trading is decentralized and suggests that trade centralization should come with greater standardization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although everyone must make decisions about where to live, we know little about how consumers perceive social interactions with neighbors and incorporate information about neighbors into their residence decisions. This article explores the impact of consumers' self‐construal on the importance they attribute to neighbor information when choosing a residence. Across seven preregistered studies, including lab experiments and online surveys, the findings consistently show that independent consumers, compared with interdependent ones, place greater importance on information about potential neighbors. This tendency stems from independent consumers' stronger desire for social closeness with neighbors, prompting them to place more weight on information that will help them find neighbors with whom they could become friends.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital streamers gain popularity in live commerce, online retailers face critical questions about the actual business value of their operations. This study offers timely, evidence-based insights into the economic impact and optimal design of digital streamers. Although current designs do not significantly improve sales over no live streaming, incorporating behavioral realism—especially enhanced real-time question and answer (Q&amp;A)—can boost sales by 25%, making digital streamers as effective as human hosts. Visual upgrades and human-like voices also help but to a lesser degree. Importantly, not all AI-driven enhancements deliver immediate returns, and imitating human scripts does not guarantee success. Retailers should focus on dynamic human-AI interaction features that drive engagement and trust, such as real-time Q&amp;A and interactive giveaways. Designers are encouraged to integrate multiple realism features to maximize effectiveness while managing cost and scalability. These findings offer actionable guidance for retailers and platform designers seeking to leverage AI effectively and cost efficiently in live streaming commerce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What human capital do established organizations need to bring new ideas to market? Combining Danish registry and Community Innovation Survey data, we document a robust positive relationship between hiring former founders and firms' sales from innovation. Entrepreneurs join smaller, younger firms (which exhibit larger effects), managerial skills and external industry founding experience matter, while other selection or human capital‐based explanations appear muted. Founder hires especially enhance innovation when given middle management decision rights, for incremental offerings, and in innovation‐active firms. Our collective findings indicate startup experience equips founders with a generalist ability to acquire and mobilize resources around new ideas. By clarifying the nature of entrepreneurial human capital, we highlight a novel innovation input that helps firms unlock its commercial value.Managerial SummaryAs entrepreneurial careers proliferate, former founders represent a growing pool of potential employees with expertise in bringing new products and services to market. Can hiring entrepreneurs help established organizations enhance innovation? Using data from Denmark, we answer this question affirmatively and offer several explanations. Former founders gravitate towards younger, smaller established firms, where effects are stronger; they also bring valuable managerial skills and external industry founding experience. Notably, they generate more value when given broader authority as middle managers, for less obvious resource combinations, firms already active in innovation or research and development, and higher uncertainty contexts. Taken together, our findings suggest former founders' distinct combination of skills helps firms marshal resources around new offerings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;After medical marijuana legalization (MML) by U.S. states, firms’ cost of equity (COE) decreases, especially for those with more growth opportunities, higher productivity, or a more skilled workforce. This policy change also reduces firm risk and leads to an increase in labor supply through increased labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and net migration. Further, home prices rise after MML, reflecting increased local housing demand due to a growing supply of workers. These findings align with theoretical models that link asset prices to labor markets and suggest that MML can lower firms’ COE by mitigating labor search frictions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the effects of a multiday cyberattack that forced offline a technology service provider (TSP) to the banking sector. The attack impaired customers’ ability to send payments through the TSP, but the business continuity plans of banks and the TSP reduced the effect by more than half. Large banks performed better. Through contagion, banks not directly exposed to the attack experienced a liquidity shortfall, causing them to borrow funds or tap reserves. The ability to send payments after hours helped avoid further contagion. These results highlight the importance of preparedness by the private and official sector for cyberattacks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aggregate U.S. bank lending to firms expanded following the outbreak of COVID‐19. Using loan‐level supervisory data, we show that this expansion was driven by draws on credit lines by large firms. Banks that experienced larger credit line drawdowns restricted term lending more, crowding out credit to smaller firms, which reacted by reducing investment. A structural model calibrated to match our empirical results shows that while credit lines increase total bank credit in bad times, they redistribute credit from firms with high propensities to invest to firms with low propensities to invest, exacerbating the decrease in aggregate investment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do movements in the distributions of bank size and income affect the macroeconomy? To answer this question, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous financial intermediaries, incomplete markets, and aggregate uncertainty. We find that market incompleteness and uninsured idiosyncratic bank rate of return risk generate minimal concentration in the bank net worth distribution, leading to an “as-if” result, whereby the economy behaves as if it had a representative bank. However, introducing ex ante heterogeneity in the banks’ rates of return significantly raises concentration and amplifies real and financial fluctuations relative to the representative-bank case, as this increases a key sufficient statistic, the average marginal propensity to lend. We then extend the model with two empirically validated features of the banking sector—countercyclical return risk and deposit market power—and show that these amplify and dampen aggregate fluctuations, respectively. Finally, because in the model with ex ante heterogeneity the distribution of bank size is highly concentrated, shocks to the largest banks can account for almost all of the aggregate variation that is due to idiosyncratic risk, leading to granular banking and economic cycles. The failure of granular banks (“too big to fail”) produces sizeable macroeconomic crises.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Bunker Refueling Under Price Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bunker refueling decisions in international shipping are crucial operational choices. Each ship acts like a movable storage unit navigating through diverse markets, procuring bunker fuels from different ports to sustain its voyage. This involves grappling with challenges posed by varying bunker fuel prices over time and locations. To address this, we propose data-drivenstructure-prescriptive (SP) approachesthat combine the strengths of modern machine learning with the insights from traditional OR modeling and optimization. Instead of predicting future fuel prices, our approach directly learns the optimal policy from data and adapts refueling decisions to the current market conditions, including fuel prices, crude oil price, NYSE index, etc.Our focus lies in leveraging the well-established understanding that the optimal refueling decision adheres to a state-dependent base-stock refueling policy. This decision depends on factors such as the port of call, fuel tank capacity, market conditions, and is finite-valued, depending on the ship’s schedule and voyage. We provide a practical framework to incorporate these structural properties into data-driven decision-making. The finite-valued property, for instance, establishes a connection between the refueling problem and multi-class classification, integrating OR modeling with machine learning.We test our approach through experiments under both simulated scenarios and a real-world example involving the Asia-North America Trade Route. The proposed SP approaches successfully recovered the “true” optimal refueling policy in synthetic simulations. Our real-world data experiments further demon-strate that integrating structural properties into the learning process enhances the quality of prescriptions, particularly when training data is limited. Specifically, with one and a half years of training data, the proposed methods outperform current industry practices. With less than three years of training data, our models yield substantial fuel cost savings, approximately 40 US dollars per metric ton, during the testing period.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Efficiency and Interventions of Strategic Driver Relocation for Ride-Hailing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Idle drivers’ spontaneous relocation, when provided with sufficient information, has the potential to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance in ride-hailing services. As this potential remains ambiguous, this study aims to address two fundamental questions and derive managerial insights: Q1: To what extent can drivers’ spontaneous relocation resolve the supply-demand imbalance? Q2: How can subsidies be designed to induce the platform optimum? We propose a leader-follower game-theoretic framework to investigate the dynamic relocation game on arbitrary service networks. The platform, as the leader, designs relocation subsidies to achieve service-oriented or interest-oriented goals, while idle drivers, as followers, decide relocation and compete for individual returns in a multi-stage context. Despite the inherent problem complexity, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, transformation, and solution of the driver equilibrium, providing insights into these critical questions. First, the platform should avoid issuing subsidies purely for relocation purposes when drivers’ actions align with platform goals, such as 1) when the supply and demand are sufficiently imbalanced in volume, eliminating drivers’ gambling behavior, and 2) when commission rates are low—a plausible case in practice—due to the tension between the platform and drivers. Second, we present the potential of the platform intervention in other cases, providing theoretical references for the platform expectations. Notably, due to the extra responsibility gap, the subsidy impact on completed trips exceeds that on platform profits, with the latter at most doubling. Third, we investigate the imbalance in demand that values the platform’s intervention. While a certain spatial imbalance or a demand surge in peak hours emphasizes subsidies for platform goals, the spatial and temporal imbalance can possibly complement each other, inducing coupled demand that directly achieves platform-optimal goals. These results comprehensively answer Q1 along with practical suggestions. Fourth, for Q2, we confirm its feasibility and provide actionable subsidy configurations that induce platform-optimal goals to aid platform management. Numerical examples demonstrate that sparse network structures can lead to larger realized gaps. Additionally, drivers with appropriately random behavior can enhance platform performance, suggesting careful information disclosure by platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores the effects of competition on fair trade operations. Specifically, as a benchmark, we first consider a model with a single fair trade organization (FTO), i.e., a monopoly FTO. We then extend the analysis to a setting with two competing FTOs, i.e., duopoly FTOs. Although both FTOs share the common goal of alleviating farmers’ poverty, they adopt contrasting strategies: one FTO seeks to lower the barriers to fair trade, aiming tomainstreamit, while the other maintains stricter standards to preventfairwashing(orgreenwashing). Following industry practices, we implement two modes of competition and compare them with the monopoly benchmark. We find that, while competition between FTOs increases the aggregate demand for fair trade certified products (mainstreaming), it results in less aggregate premium (fairwashing). Furthermore, we consider the potential application of blockchain technology in fair trade operations and demonstrate that it offers a promising solution to mitigate thefairwashingeffects from competition between FTOs.</content>

    <title>Does Q&amp;amp;A Boost Engagement? Health Messaging Experiments in the United States and Ghana</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective information sharing is critical for the success of organizations and governments. Because information that is easy to access is more likely to be adopted, leaders often minimize friction in information delivery. However, one type of friction may increase engagement: piquing curiosity by posing relevant questions prior to sharing information. To test this, we shared identical information about COVID-19 in either question-and-answer format or via direct statements across two preregistered field experiments in Ghana and Michigan (total n = 49,395). Q&amp;A-style communication increased information seeking about directly related topics (e.g., how to wear a mask properly) by 1.0 percentage point (216%) in Ghana and by 1.1 percentage points (19%) in Michigan (p’s &lt; 0.001) and increased self-reported behavior change by 1.3 percentage points (4%) in Michigan (p = 0.002). However, sharing information in Q&amp;A format did not increase interest in general COVID-19 information in either setting, suggesting that the impact of Q&amp;A-style messaging on information seeking may be issue specific. In Michigan, both Q&amp;A-style and direct statement messaging produced less information seeking than sending no informational messages, likely because of differential attrition: the more texts participants received, the more likely they were to opt out of receiving messages, which made it impossible for them to seek more information via text. In a follow-up implementation experiment with social media ads (a messaging strategy without attrition challenges), Q&amp;A-style ads generated 9%–11% more unique clicks to the CDC website per dollar spent than ads that directly stated information about vaccines (p &lt; 0.001). We speculate that Q&amp;A-style information delivery may stimulate curiosity, driving its benefits.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the National Science Foundation [RAPID Grant 2033321], the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Northwestern University’s Global Poverty Research Lab, Stanford University’s Golub Capital Social Impact Lab, Harvard Business School, the University of Pennsylvania, the AKO Foundation, John Alexander, Mark J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We utilize the introduction of mobile payment technology by the largest bank in Singapore in 2017 to study how mobile payment technology reshapes economic activities and stimulates business creation. After the introduction, business-to-consumer industries witnessed 18.3% more business creation relative to business-to-business industries, with the effect driven by small firms and more pronounced among industries with higher cash handling costs. Underlying this pattern is consumers’ strong adoption of mobile payment and a reduction in ATM cash withdrawals during the post-shock period. The reduced transaction cost also increases consumers’ spending capacity, which justifies the business growth. Interestingly, part of the increased consumer demand is credit card spending. The pattern of changes is consistent with the bank’s adjustment to the technological change: it reduces ATMs and allows more credit card openings and higher credit limits.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: Y.

    <title>Conquering the Divide? The Role of Political Polarization in the Destigmatization of a U.S. Medical Marijuana Platform Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A documented recent rise in the polarization of American legislative politics underscores the question of how increasing political polarization affects organizations and industries. Yet, organizational scholars have not directed significant attention to the impact of polarization. In this paper, we demonstrate that political polarization may play an important role in organizational dynamics by revealing that polarization may expedite the destigmatization of legal yet historically stigmatized industries. To this end, we develop a theory explaining how political polarization normalizes counter-normative behavior and encourages customers to become open about their engagement with stigmatized products and organizations—a key step toward industry destigmatization. We further argue that this polarization impact may vary across regional markets because of differences in local legitimation processes that can either amplify (normative legitimacy) or attenuate (regulatory legitimacy) the effect of polarization on consumer engagement with a stigmatized industry. We find empirical evidence for our theorizing in analyses of all U.S. dispensaries of medical marijuana that existed on the online platformWeedmaps.comfrom its beginning in 2008 to 2014. Ultimately, this paper suggests that political polarization can significantly influence organizations and industries and thus warrants more systematic investigation and attention from organizational scholars, particularly in stigmatized industries.</content>

    <title>Connected to a Sinking Ship? Firm Performance in a Besieged Autocracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Doing business in an autocracy that still permits the existence of markets is fundamentally different than operating under a democracy. This variety of state capitalism, termed authoritarian capitalism, requires specific form of political connections to the regime in order to survive and, in some cases, to thrive. However, authoritarian governance has another defining feature—namely paroxysms of political violence of different modalities, a phenomenon that can harm business but may benefit those who are connected to the regime. This paper examines life under a particular authoritarian capitalist state, 19th-century tsarist Russia, via an examination of one politically connected firm, the full-service steamship firm Kavkaz i Merkurii (Caucasus and Mercury). Using never-before-utilized company archival material to examine the firm’s relationship with the tsar, I find that management directly pursued intense business linkages with the government, even appointing tsarist officials and members of the royal family to leadership positions. This behavior increased even as political violence skyrocketed throughout Russia. A formal empirical analysis shows that this strategy was mostly beneficial for the firm, as some forms of political violence were received positively by shareholders as a source of new business. However, military action that drew heavily on the firm—where the government was underpaying relative to market rates—was perceived negatively by investors, and violence, which could have threatened the regime, manifested in higher long-term volatility. This paper shows both the benefits and costs associated with political connections under authoritarian capitalism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formulate a tractable model of pricing under directed search with heterogeneous firm demands. Demand characteristics drive bids in a position auction and enable us to bridge insights from the ordered search literature to those in the position auction literature. Equilibrium pricing implies that the marginal consumer’s surplus decreases down the search order, so consumers optimally follow the firms’ position ordering. A firm suffers from “business stealing” by firms that precede it and “search appeal” from subsequent firms. We find rankings that achieve the maximal joint profit or consumer surplus by constructing firm-specific scores. A generalized second price auction for positions endogenizes equilibrium orders and bids are driven by position externalities that impact incremental profit from switching positions. The joint profit maximization order is upheld when firm heterogeneity concerns mostly their mark-up potentials. But the consumer welfare order is robust when firms differ mostly over their potential market sizes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Politicians rely on political brokers to buy votes throughout much of the developing world. We investigate how social networks facilitate these vote-buying exchanges. Our conceptual framework suggests brokers should be particularly well-placed within the network to learn about non-copartisans’ reciprocity in order to target transfers effectively. As a result, parties should recruit brokers who are central among non-copartisans. We combine village network data from brokers and citizens with broker reports of vote buying, allowing us to use broker and citizen fixed effects. We show that networks diffuse information about citizens to brokers who leverage it to target transfers. In particular, among those citizens who are not registered to their party, brokers target reciprocal citizens about whom they can learn more through their network, and these citizens are more likely to support the brokers’ party. Moreover, recruited brokers are significantly more central than other citizens among non-copartisans, but not among copartisans. These results highlight the importance of information diffusion through social networks for vote buying, broker recruitment, and ultimately for political outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A seller with commitment power sets prices over time. Risk-averse buyers arrive to the market and decide when to purchase. We show that it is optimal for the seller to choose a constant high price punctuated by occasional episodes of sequential discounts that occur at random times. This optimal price path has the property that the price a buyer ends up paying is independent of his arrival and purchase times, and only depends on his valuation. Our theory accommodates empirical findings on the timing of discounts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We obtain a proprietary data set of all marketable orders routed to one or more wholesalers in May 2022 to study wholesaler execution quality. Contrary to conventional wisdom, external liquidity is used to fill 28.6% of the shares in our sample. We find that order size, both absolute and relative to book depth, and recent order imbalance are associated with the decision to source external liquidity. Using a new benchmark, we find the value of both price and size improvement provided to sample orders is 6.5 times greater than the value of price improvement as measured by mandatory monthly Rule 605 reports. Our results indicate that price improvement is not the only measure that should be used when evaluating the relative benefits of the current market structure to alternatives.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04156 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine effects on productivity, employment, and debt outcomes among college students whose parents reside in areas that experience financial shocks caused by natural disasters. After shocks, treated students exhibit poorer academic performance. To boost the impaired grade point average, these students sacrifice educational content by withdrawing from more courses and enrolling in fewer STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) courses. Effects are stronger for middle class students likely relying on family income to pay for college. Students mostly mitigate financial shocks with additional part-time employment. Ultimately, disrupted students are 10% more likely to default on student loans. Overall, these results shed light on the effects of financial stress on the intensive margin of human capital formation.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02977 .</content>

    <title>Tenant Riskiness, Contract Length, and the Term Structure of Commercial Leases</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the connection between tenant riskiness, commercial lease length, and the term structure of lease contracts. Theory shows that the possibility of default on a long-term lease generates a risk/lease-length connection. The empirical work uses a large CompStak lease data set combined with tenant characteristics (including risk) from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). Regressions show that lease length is inversely related to the D&amp;B risk measures, as predicted, and that risky tenants pay a higher rent premium for long-term contracts than low-risk tenants. The presence of such tenants thus raises the slope of the term structure of commercial rents.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04959 .</content>

    <title>The Bright Side of Lower Quality: Evidence from Restaurant Exploration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The value derived from hedonic goods is affected by reference effects at the time of consumption, usually in the form of quality standards. Consumption typically involves two steps: First, the consumer chooses a given good, among a pool of available choices; then, the consumer experiences the good and derives a satisfaction from it. Between both steps, consumers might build expectations about the good that might affect the ultimate realized utility. We investigate the role of quality references in this two-stage (choice-outcome) process. We develop a flexible framework for estimating quality references and their effect in choice and outcome that can include consumers’ own past experiences, as well as that of others, and can give salience to more recent or more distant past experiences. Using novel longitudinal data from online restaurant reviews, we find evidence of quality loss aversion in the choice decision stage in accordance with prospect theory. However, in the outcome stage, we do find evidence of the opposite to loss aversion, that is, satisfaction is affected much less than one would expect when going to a lower quality restaurant. This is consistent with consumers adjusting their expectations downward and suggests that expectation adjustment protects consumers when they experience a good of lower-than-reference quality. Our results challenge the implicit assumption made by most recommendation systems that the expectation building process after making a choice does not change the outcome and imply that it may be better to patronize activities by alternating between high- and low-quality choices.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04141 .</content>

    <title>The Power of Posting: An Examination of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; Social Media Celebrity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing prevalence of social media has prompted discussions regarding its impact on the social evaluations of organizational leaders. In this study, we develop the construct of CEO social media celebrity, which arises when a CEO obtains high levels of attention and positive emotional responses from audiences on social media. Building upon parasocial interaction theory, we examine how a CEO's posting influences their likelihood of becoming a social media celebrity. Analyzing 320 S&amp;P 1500 CEOs on X (formerly Twitter) from 2009 to 2021, who posted over 250,000 times and attracted 1.6 mentions from social media users, we find that the volume, positivity, and variety of CEO posts relate positively to CEO social media celebrity attainment, while the uniqueness of their posts shows no such effect. Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that the nature of the CEO's social media posts relates differently to the two dimensions of CEO social media celebrity (i.e., larger audience attention and positive emotional reactions). We offer suggestions for future research to further enrich the understanding of social evaluations in an increasingly digital world and provide practical insights for CEOs seeking to boost their public profile using social media.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between international trade and development in a model where countries differ in their capability, goods differ in their complexity, and capability growth is a function of a country's pattern of specialization. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for international trade to increase capability growth in all countries and, in turn, to push all countries up the development ladder. This occurs if (i) shifting employment towards more complex sectors raises capability growth and if (ii) foreign competition is tougher in less complex sectors for all countries. Empirically, we provide causal evidence consistent with (i) using the entry of countries into the World Trade Organization as an instrumental variable for other countries' patterns of specialization. The opposite of (ii), however, holds in the data. Through the lens of our model, these two empirical observations imply dynamic welfare losses from trade that are pervasive, albeit small for the median country. The same economic forces also suggest that the emergence of China has held back capability growth for a number of African countries who are pushed away from their most-complex sectors, which China exports, and into their least-complex sectors, which China imports.</content>

    <title>Litigation risk and IPO underpricing: evidence from federal judge ideology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using federal judge ideology as an exogenous measure of issuing firms’ litigation risk, we document that the initial public offerings (IPOs) of the firms headquartered in more liberal circuits are more underpriced. The effect is mitigated when plaintiffs’ pleading standards are more stringent and is amplified when judges have more discretion in their decisions. The effect is also amplified among deep pocketed issuing firms, while it is mitigated among issuing firms hiring reputable intermediaries in the IPO process. The results of additional analysis suggest that issuing firms located in more liberal circuits are more likely to become targets of lawsuits after their IPOs and that these lawsuits are less likely to be dismissed by the courts and result in larger settlements. Collectively, our findings underscore the salience of litigation risk stemming from the issuing firms’ legal environment in driving IPO underpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic led to sharp declines in public transit ridership, resulting in budget shortfalls and service cuts that disproportionately affect vulnerable riders who lack alternative transportation options. Understanding the effect of vaccination on public transportation demand is important for planning for demand recovery as vaccination efforts progress. This study examines this effect, with a particular focus on heterogeneous effects across population groups. Estimating the impact of vaccination is challenging due to a lack of fine-grained data and potential endogeneity issues. To overcome these hurdles, we exploit the distinctive features of the COVID-19 vaccination progress to identify an instrumental variable. By merging the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination data with county-level mobility data, we construct a sample that links vaccination rates to the demand for public transportation and follow the instrumental variable approach to estimate the impact. We show that higher vaccination rates led to increases in public transportation demand, as reflected in mobility data from transit stations. Furthermore, we find the effect of vaccination on public transit demand is 50% greater in counties with a larger uninsured population and 80% greater in counties with a higher share of residents without a college degree. Our findings suggest that as vaccination efforts progress, public transit agencies should proactively strengthen their infrastructure to accommodate the anticipated rise in ridership. A strategic, forward-looking approach will be critical to ensuring a sustainable and effective recovery of public transportation systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As omnichannel operations become increasingly important for meeting diverse customer expectations in retail, continuous innovation in service and business models is essential to maintain a competitive edge. While effective order fulfillment is key to omnichannel success, the manual picking process in physical stores, one of the major driver of fulfillment costs, still offers substantial opportunities for improvement. This paper focuses on thecrowdpickingmodel as an innovative approach to manage online order picking operations in physical stores by leveraging existing in-store customers, offering a business model with considerable potential. We explore the real-time assignment of orders to in-store customers using ML to identify effective assignment policies. These policies are combined with a task-decomposition strategy to reduce picking costs and enhance crowdpicker participation as a key resource. The proposed crowdpicking model and its real-time management framework are tested on real-world data. Our results show that a well-managed crowdpicking system can lower order picking costs by more than 20% and provide actionable insights for managers in designing such systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we define and develop the concept of avant-garde market driving, a process whereby producers transform an industry by rebelling against the status quo as a means of social-industrial critique rather than in response to market demand. Avant-garde market driving is primarily driven by a desire to rebel against the status quo, at the expense of widespread acceptance; it involves a multiplicity of like-minded individuals such as other producers, intermediaries and consumers; it occurs particularly in contexts where like-minded consumers seek hedonic or aesthetic novelty or social distinction. Breaking new ground comes with substantial challenges. How do rebel producers overcome the challenges of introducing radically different products and successfully sustain avant-garde market driving? Analyzing the wine market in France, we find that avant-garde market driving is initiated and sustained by symbolic disruption and vertical collaboration among producers and intermediaries. This process can provide a strategic advantage to smaller, low-status firms. Based on our analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for producers and intermediaries who wish to engage in avant-garde market driving.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A war‐related factor model derived from textual analysis of media news reports explains the cross section of expected stock returns. Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how relative performance evaluation (RPE) affects industry competition—a question relevant for corporate boards interested in incentivizing executives. Using U.S. airline data, we estimate a dynamic game of competition between heterogeneous firms in an oligopolistic market, with managers incentivized by RPE contracts. While RPE can induce a firm to compete more intensely by smoothing compensation, it also amplifies a firm’s cost efficiency relative to its peers and can weaken competition from inefficient firms. The first effect dominates in small markets and the second in median-sized markets. RPE has little effect in large, highly profitable markets.</content>

    <title>An Empirical Study of Strategic Opacity in Crowdsourced Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowd-voting mechanisms are commonly used to implement scalable evaluations of crowdsourced creative submissions. Unfortunately, the use of crowd-voting also raises the potential for gaming and manipulation. Manipulation is problematic because (1) submitters’ motivation depends on their belief that the system is meritocratic, and (2) manipulated feedback may undermine learning, as submitters seek to learn from received evaluations and those of peers. In this work, we consider a design approach to addressing the issue, focusing on the notion of strategic opacity, i.e., purposefully obfuscating evaluation procedures. On the one hand, opacity may reduce the incentive and thus the prevalence of vote manipulation, and submitters may instead dedicate that time and effort to improving their submission quantity or quality. On the other hand, because opacity makes it difficult for submitters to discern the returns to legitimate effort, submitters may also reduce their submission effort or simply exit the market. We explored this tension via a multimethod study employing field experiments at 99designs and a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observed consistent results across all experiments: opacity leads to reductions in gaming in these crowdsourcing contests and significant increases in the allocation of effort toward legitimate vs. illegitimate activities, with no discernible influence on contest participation. We discuss boundary conditions and the implications for contest organizers and contest platform operators.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A slowdown in revenue growth, referred to as revenue stall in this study, is a key concern for any firm. We examine how information technology-producing firms (i.e., IT firms) differ from non-IT firms in experiencing revenue stall and in benefiting from R&amp;D investments in terms of reduced revenue stall. We hypothesize that whereas IT firms experience more revenue stall than non-IT firms, R&amp;D investments reduce revenue stall to a greater extent in IT firms than in non-IT firms. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of more than 1,400 large public firms in the United States from 1950 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses. Consistent with the theoretical arguments underlying our hypotheses, we also find that IT firms experience higher competition, dynamism, and turbulence, and have higher intangible assets than non-IT firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The research on online social movements generally concludes that collective identity, i.e., the sense of we-ness that individual protesters in a movement share, is not only unattainable but also dispensable, even though it is considered a defining feature of traditional movements. In this paper, we explore one of the boundary conditions of these findings, namely the riskiness of protest practices. Analysing the high-risk social movement, My Stealthy Freedom (MySF), which contests compulsory hijab in Iran in a way that hybridizes online and offline protest practices, we show that a sense of collectiveness can be instantiated in online social movements, why it is critical to the success of high-risk activism, and how it is (re)produced. Comparing and contrasting three instantiations of MySF, each of which was enacted on a different social media platform, we develop a theoretical model of how feelings of collectiveness are enacted in high-risk online activism. In addition to providing guidance for online movements where collective identity is desirable, our study challenges prior research on online activism by theorizing the role of embodiment, affect, and the dialectic between activists’ personal and the movement’s collective identity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As AI becomes integral to enterprise decision-making, this study explores the collaborative dynamics between managers and AI systems, focusing on human willingness to delegate tasks to AI. Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employed a hidden Markov model in a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We found that there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time—in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings.</content>

    <title>The Complementor’s Dilemma: Navigating Growth Ambitions and the Dependency on Focal Actors in Platform Ecosystems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on platform ecosystems increasingly recognizes that nonfocal actors such as complementors may have growth ambitions. Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from nonfocal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the nonfocal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. Referring to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, we unpack the process whereby a nonfocal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examined the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a nonfocal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is increasingly common for consumers to engage with various tasks on their personal devices amid other distractions such as watching television at home, shopping at malls, or attending concerts. While this split in attention poses challenges, it also opens valuable opportunities for advertisers to strategically push targeted advertisements based on information about the user’s environment. Across a series of controlled lab experiments using a custom app developed for this study, we demonstrate how marketers can optimize pop-up advertising on consumers’ personal devices within distraction-filled environments. In doing so, we extend traditional insights from dual-task interference studies that have previously focused on corresponding tasks in isolation, without considering any stimuli from the environment. Our results indicate that, in the presence of additional stimuli from the environment, a facilitating relationship exists between the attention paid to a task and the effectiveness of pop-up advertisements interrupting the task. However, this relationship is moderated by the extent of attention diffusion from the environment. As the distance between the task and the environment increases, consumer attention to the task is more diffused, resulting in poorer encoding of the pop-up advertisements. Critically, optimizing the content and timing of pop-up advertisements to the environmental content can significantly improve their effectiveness. Our results have important implications for helping marketers develop actionable strategies for mobile advertising in distraction-filled environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many real-world process automation environments are rife with high-expertise and limited labeled data. We propose a computational design science artifact to automate systematic review (SR) in such an environment. SR is a manual process that collects and synthesizes data from medical literature to inform medical decisions and improve clinical practice. Existing machine learning solutions for SR automation suffer from a lack of labeled data and a misrepresentation of the high-expertise manual process. Motivated by humans’ impressive capability to learn from limited examples, we propose a principled and generalizable few-shot learning framework—FastSR—to automate the multistep, expertise-intensive SR process using minimal training data. Informed by SR experts’ annotation logic, FastSR extends the traditional few-shot learning framework by including (1) various representations to account for diverse SR knowledge, (2) attention mechanisms to reflect semantic correspondence of medical text fragments, and (3) shared representations to jointly learn interrelated tasks (i.e., sentence classification and sequence tagging). We instantiated and evaluated FastSR on three test beds: full-text articles from Wilson disease (WD) and COVID-19, as well as a public dataset (EBM-NLP) containing clinical trial abstracts on a wide range of diseases. Our experiments demonstrate that FastSR significantly outperforms several benchmarking solutions and expedites the SR project by up to 65%. We critically examine the SR outcomes and practical advantages of FastSR compared to other ML and manual SR solutions and propose a new FastSR-augmented protocol. Overall, our multifaceted evaluation quantitatively and qualitatively underscores the efficacy and applicability of FastSR in expediting SR. Our results have important implications for designing computational artifacts for automating/augmenting processes in high-expertise, low-label environments.</content>

    <title>The Interplay Between Healthcare Information Technologies and Denied Claims</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of health information technology (HIT) in reducing claim denials, which are a significant burden for healthcare providers in the U.S. We theorize the impacts of electronic health records (EHRs) on claim denials, starting with an examination of EHR adoption and followed by a deeper assessment of how EHRs are sourced both within a hospital and across hospitals in the same health system. We propose that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. Using a large-scale dataset of claim records from the state of Maryland from 2012-2016, we found that the greater the EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, our findings suggest that EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observed a decrease in claim denials when physicians previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multifaceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance.</content>

    <title>Does Ransomware Make Investors “WannaCry”? On Investors’ Divergent Reactions to Ransomware Hits and Near Misses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, ransomware has become one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with successful attacks causing severe operational disruptions and staggering damages. Rationally speaking, investors should react negatively to firms’ ransomware disclosures, but this may not always be the case. Based on norm theory, we describe a paradoxical phenomenon wherein investors exhibit negative reactions to ransomware hits (i.e., events that led to operational disruptions) but positive reactions to near misses (i.e., events in which operational disruptions were narrowly avoided). The positive reactions occur due to an outcome bias in which near-miss events—events that are objectively negative but less severe than expected—are viewed positively instead of negatively. We tested these predictions by reporting on an investigation of stock market reactions to disclosures of ransomware hits vs. near misses. To do so, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of ransomware incidents disclosed by U.S. public firms. Using the event study method, we estimated abnormal stock market returns and found evidence in support of our predictions. First, in line with expectations, ransomware hits that led to the expected severe impact resulted in stock price drops of -4.40%. However, near misses, where disruptions were avoided, were rewarded with gains of 2.87%, confirming positive instead of negative reactions. This offers new insights into investors’ biased responses to certain cybersecurity incidents. These positive reactions, however, represent a call for caution because, albeit seemingly favorable, they mask underlying risks.</content>

    <title>Do Digital Platforms Improve the Performance of Nonbinding Contracts? Evidence From the Amazon Freight Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how digital platforms influence the performance of nonbinding contracts. Businesses in many industries with high uncertainty, such as trucking freight and construction, simultaneously use nonbinding contracts, which impose no legal sanctions for refusals, and spot markets, which facilitate real-time, flexible transactions with market-determined prices. Understanding the conditions under which nonbinding contracts perform is a major concern in these industries. Leveraging the entry of the Amazon Freight platform in the trucking freight industry, we demonstrate that adding a digital platform-enabled spot marketplace improves the performance of nonbinding contracts. We identified several mechanisms driving this effect: (1) expanding carriers’ transportation capacity, (2) lowering spot market prices, and (3) reducing shippers’ reliance on nonbinding contracts for shorter-haul truckloads. Moreover, the digital platform’s impact on enhancing nonbinding contract performance is particularly pronounced in markets with volatile demand and shorter hauls. This research contributes to understanding the impacts of digital platforms in highly uncertain industries that simultaneously use nonbinding contracts and spot markets. Our findings provide implications to policymakers and business managers on leveraging digital platforms to improve operational efficiency in highly uncertain industries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Augmented reality (AR) is rapidly emerging as a transformative display technology, blending computer-generated content with the real-world environment in real time. Using divided attention theory, this study investigates how different information delivery channels (i.e., AR vs. mobile phone) and the nature of information (i.e., dependence on specific physical context and complexity) affect work performance. A field experiment in the aircraft maintenance context demonstrates that the effect on work performance of providing information via AR vs. a mobile phone is mediated by work attentiveness. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of AR is particularly pronounced when information is highly dependent on the specific physical context but diminishes when information complexity is high. This research deepens our understanding of how presenting information directly in front of users’ eyes (i.e., via AR) affects their attention management and work performance. The findings have significant implications for firms in terms of how to leverage AR to enhance work performance in industrial settings.</content>

    <title>Organizing for AI Innovation: Insights From an Empirical Exploration of U.S. Patents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations is on the rise, firms frequently report failures and setbacks in their development and implementation of AI innovation efforts. One common issue behind many failing AI initiatives is that they are organized just like other information technology (IT) innovation efforts. To elucidate why and how the production of AI and IT innovations may need to be managed differently, this study juxtaposes these two types of innovations based on two key dimensions of the Schumpeterian framework: the form (product vs. process) and magnitude (radical vs. incremental) of innovations. By analyzing a matched sample of AI and IT patents, we found robust evidence that AI innovations are less radical and more process oriented than comparable IT innovations. Drawing upon our empirical discovery, we developed a conceptual framework to suggest a new way to think about organizing AI innovation. Our research contributes to the literature and practice on AI innovation by illuminating the comparative differences between AI innovations and other IT innovations and advancing a set of empirically derived propositions on how firms may be able to better manage their AI innovation activities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial is inspired by a growing concern within the information systems (IS) community that novelty has become a dominant criterion for publication, despite being unevenly interpreted and poorly specified. In our editorial experience, when authors are told that their papers lack novelty, they often receive little concrete guidance on what precisely counts as novelty, how it varies across paradigms, or how it should be balanced with rigor and relevance.</content>

    <title>Fake News and True News Assessment: The Persuasive Effect of Discursive Evidence in Judging Veracity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals are often unable to assess the veracity of news claims—especially on social media platforms. Recent research has suggested that interventions indicating normative signals, such as flagging false claims, are not always effective. We propose an approach in which users are provided with discursive evidence to consider in determining the veracity of claims rather than depending on normative true or false flags. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different forms of discursive evidence on individual judgments of the veracity of news claims. We found that providing such evidence can significantly improve individuals’ judgment of both true and false news claims—with certain caveats. Providing discursive evidence with high evidence strength leads to a general increase in veracity judgment. Discursive evidence containing items with lower evidence strength may shift believability— thus improving judgments for either true or false claims but degrading them for the other. We also identify important asymmetries between true and false claims, finding that the effect of some evidence may be improved if people are in a more critical mindset—for example, by priming them to think about the concept of truth and lies. Taken together, these results extend knowledge on the problem of fake news and may suggest effective approaches to address the problem without diminishing attention to true news.</content>

    <title>Engaging Physicians with Introductory Incentives: References to Online and Offline Income</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incentives make or break user contributions. While providing introductory incentives to attract new users has become increasingly popular among online communities, their impact on user contributions remains largely unknown. Utilizing a policy change that doubled the incentives paid to physicians in a leading online health community, we examined the impacts of both the initiation and the termination of such introductory incentives on physician contributions (in terms of patient consultations) and how the impacts varied according to the physician’s online and offline income. We found that despite an increase in physician contributions during the policy window, the introductory incentives unintentionally decreased physician contributions after the policy window ended. Additionally, physicians tended to anchor their contributions using their online rather than offline income as a reference point, suggesting that mental accounting was at play. Our findings provide a cautionary perspective on the unintended consequences of using introductory incentives and reveal the associated mechanisms of mental accounting when users make contributions (or not) to online communities. These findings provide important implications for incentive design and user engagement in online communities.</content>

    <title>Dancing to the #Challenge: The Effect of TikTok on Closing the Artist Gender Gap in the Music Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how “Hashtag Dance Challenges” (HDCs), a phenomenon popularized on the short-video platform TikTok, are instrumental in helping music artists gain traction in the digital music marketplace. HDCs represent an appealing combination of music and dance, designed to engage users and achieve virality, thereby benefiting artists whose music is featured. This research focuses on how HDCs contribute to the success of women artists, as compared to men, in an industry known for its diversity but challenged by gender inclusivity. We apply role congruity theory to posit that women artists are in a better position to derive benefits from being featured on HDCs, relative to male artists, particularly in cases of gender concordance—when both the creator and the artist are women. We measure the benefits of HDCs using daily changes in the artist’s followership on Spotify, a leading music streaming service, and test our hypotheses using song and artist-level data collected from Spotify and TikTok. We found that artists featured in a new HDC achieve a significant increase in followership on Spotify, relative to similar artists not featured in an HDC. Further, we observed that women creators drive this effect, enhancing the daily growth of Spotify followers by approximately 3% more for women artists, underscoring the value of gender concordance. Our findings shed light on the role of short videos, especially through the vehicle of HDCs, in advancing women artists, while also promoting inclusivity within the digital music industry.</content>

    <title>The global sourcing of green products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have seen a rise in global trade of “green products”—those designed to minimize environmental harm compared to traditional alternatives. In this study, we examine the relevance of pollution haven effects—i.e., shifts of production toward countries with less stringent environmental standards—in firms’ global sourcing strategies for green products. Given the importance of credible and sustainable manufacturing practices in firms’ global value chains for green products, we expect that country environmental standards shape global sourcing decisions for green versus non-green products differently. Our findings using data on global imports and exports for more than 5000 distinct products over the 2002–2019 period show that green products are more likely to be sourced from countries with higher environmental stringency, whereas non-green product sourcing patterns align with prior research, which emphasizes the appeal of lower environmental standards and cost-efficiency. This green sourcing effect is stronger for consumer-facing products and for sourcing into countries where consumer engagement in environmentalism is higher and non-governmental organizations are more active. Unlike prior research that implies that higher environmental standards hurt exporters, our results suggest that such standards can benefit green product exporters.</content>

    <title>Sustainability Cues Can Delay Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rise of environmental concerns in recent decades, many companies have joined the initiative to advertise and promote sustainable consumption. The current research examines how providing sustainability cues to consumers might have unintended consequences of which practitioners and policymakers may not be fully aware. One pilot study and ten main studies, including two real-choice studies, show that a sustainability cue may delay consumption. That is, in an intertemporal choice, a sustainability cue can increase preference for a larger-later option over a smaller-sooner option. This effect occurs because a sustainability cue shifts a consumer’s temporal focus toward the future, leading to a shorter perceived wait time for the larger-later option. The findings further show that the delay does not emerge among those with strong green consumption values and can be circumvented if firms communicate the immediate need or instant payoff of sustainable actions. By investigating how sustainability cues shift consumer preferences between two options separated in time, the current research contributes to the literature on both sustainable consumption and intertemporal choice. The findings offer practitioners and policymakers guidelines to nudge consumers’ sustainable consumption more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model populism as the dissemination of a false “alternative reality,” according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism. (JEL D72, D82, D83)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that predictable uninformed cash flows forecast aggregate market stock returns. Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9. These results suggest price pressure is a widespread result of flows, not an anomaly. (JEL G12, G14, G35)</content>

    <title>Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This “offset” policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A nested bundling strategy creates menus in which more expensive bundles include all the goods of less expensive ones. We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles. (JEL D11, D21, D42, D82, M31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-term effect of public R&amp;D on growth in manufacturing by analyzing new data from the Cold War–era space race. We develop a novel empirical strategy that leverages US-Soviet rivalry in space technology to isolate windfall R&amp;D spending. Our results demonstrate that public R&amp;D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors. While migration responses were important, they were not sufficient to generate a wedge between local and national effects. The iconic moonshot R&amp;D program had only modest economic effects for both the local and national space-related sectors. (JEL E22, H54, L60, N12, N42, N62, O47)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Supplemental Security Income program uses a birth weight cutoff at 1,200 grams to determine eligibility. Using birth certificates linked to administrative records, we find low-income families of infants born just below the cutoff receive higher monthly cash benefits (equal to 27 percent of family income) at ages 0–2 with smaller benefits continuing through age 10. Yet we detect no improvements in health care use and mortality in infancy, nor in health and human capital outcomes as observed through young adulthood for these infants. We also find no improvements for their older siblings. (JEL I12, I13, I18, I38, J13, J14, J31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment to quantify the impact of the lifting of the Saudi women's driving ban on women's employment by randomizing rationed spaces in driver's training. Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women. The results underscore the importance of intrahousehold responses that can counteract legal gains in women's freedoms. (JEL C93, D13, J16, J22, K38, O15, O17)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many US colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that “society” dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its “disagreement cost.” We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2. (JEL D31, H24, H31, J22, J31, J62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our paper examines analyst reports and online stock opinion articles that recommend buying stocks which, based on the literature, trade at high prices and earn low future returns (“short-leg securities”). Using a textual analysis, we test whether the justifications primarily (1) emphasize safe-haven qualities, (2) indicate exuberance, or (3) highlight lottery-like features. Our results strongly point to (3). We subsequently validate our text-based inferences through a survey of institutional and retail investors with long positions in short-leg securities. Overall, perceived upside potential appears to play a material role in driving investor demand for stocks in the short legs of anomalies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Binsbergen, Han, and Lopez-Lira (2023) predict analysts’ forecast errors using a random forest model. A strategy that trades against this model’s predictions earns a monthly alpha of 1.54% (t-value = 5.84). This estimate represents a large improvement over studies using classical statistical methods. We attribute the difference to a look-ahead bias. Removing the bias erases the alpha. Linear models yield as accurate forecasts and superior trading profits. Neither alternative machine learning models nor combinations thereof resurrect the predictability. We discuss the state of research into the term structure of analysts’ forecasts and its causal relationship with returns. (JEL G12, G31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study depositor behavior and capital flight using data from the Freedman’s Savings Bank, a bank established after the U.S. Civil War to support formerly enslaved individuals. White depositors, who generally had better access to financial information, begin providing significant funding as interest terms are enhanced. They respond faster to postpanic stabilization efforts and negative bank-specific information, and are twice as likely to close accounts before failure, passing expected losses to Black depositors, who were the bank’s primary philanthropic target. Our results show how demand deposit funding of bank-like institutions can create systemic disadvantages for less experienced borrowers. (JEL G530, N20, O160)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an equilibrium corporate bond pricing model that accommodates the heterogeneity in institutional investors’ preferences and mandates in an empirically tractable way. Our model, estimated on rich holdings data, quantifies investors’ preferences and demand elasticities, with inelastic insurers focusing on the investment-grade segment, and elastic mutual funds substituting across ratings groups. The model offers a novel quantitative perspective of the effect of recent trends in institutional ownership on equilibrium credit spreads and the funding costs of corporations. Overall, our model emphasizes the composition of institutional demand as an important state variable for corporate bond pricing. (JEL G11, G12, G21, G22, G23, G24)</content>

    <title>Cost-Saving Synergy: Energy Stacking in Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the great potential benefits of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to electrical grids, most standalone uses of BESS are not economical due to batteries’ high upfront costs and limited lifespans. Energy stacking, a strategy of providing two or more services with a single BESS, has been of great interest to improve profitability. However, some key questions, for example, the underlying mechanism by which stacking works or why and how much it may improve profitability, remain unanswered in the literature. Using two popular battery services, we analytically show that there often exists cost-saving synergy—the cost of performing both services at the same time (simultaneous stacking) is smaller than the sum of individual costs if we had performed each service alone—which allows for bigger profits. Furthermore, we perform comparative statics on the optimal mix of the services to systemically characterize grid/market conditions that maximize/minimize this synergy. We also derive a theoretical upper bound on simultaneous stacking’s benefits, showing that it can approximately double the profit of the best standalone service. Several generalizations of the base model not only show that the main lessons continue to hold but also that stacking’s benefits may become even stronger.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03477 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of information technologies has intensified concerns about individual privacy and highlighted the importance of consumer privacy rights. At the same time, these technologies enable significant personalization of communications and offerings. We develop a theory of the effects of privacy based on the concavity of an individual’s derived payoff function with respect to market beliefs: When this function is concave, privacy is valuable. We identify market conditions that lead to concavity or convexity in the derived payoff function. The framework is applied to contexts such as product choice, price discrimination, data breaches, and health insurance.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the social capital embedded in employees’ networks contributes to firm performance. Using novel, individual-level network data, we measure a firm’s social capital derived from employees’ connections with external stakeholders. Our directed network data allow for differentiating those connections that know the employee and those that the employee knows. Results show that firms with more employee social capital perform better; the positive effect stems primarily from employees being known by others. We provide causal evidence exploiting the enactment of a government regulation that imparted a negative shock to networking with specific sectors and provide evidence on the mechanisms.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: D.

    <title>Vestigial Tails? Floor Brokers at the Close in Modern Electronic Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The closing auction is an increasingly important trade mechanism due to the rise of passive funds that require closing price execution. We study differences in auction mechanism design on NYSE and Nasdaq that may affect closing price efficiency. Unlike Nasdaq, NYSE allows late auction orders through its floor brokers, providing traders with more flexibility to mitigate or create large last-minute auction imbalances. Price changes in the closing auction are more likely to reverse on NYSE compared with Nasdaq, suggesting greater price inefficiency in NYSE closing auctions. Larger last-minute abnormal imbalances on NYSE, particularly in stocks where auction competition may be inhibited by relatively high floor broker auction fees, explain these stronger reversals. Evidence from the NYSE floor closure during the COVID-19 pandemic supports a causal interpretation. Our results highlight an important tradeoff between auction flexibility and price efficiency.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00884 .</content>

We use decision trees to endogenously group similar stocks together by selecting optimal portfolio splits to span the stochastic discount factor, projected on individual stocks. Our portfolios are interpretable and well diversified, reflecting many characteristics and their interactions. Compared to combinations of dozens (even hundreds) of single/double sorts, as well as machine‐learning prediction‐based portfolios, our cross‐sections are low‐dimensional yet have up to three times higher out‐of‐sample Sharpe ratios and alphas.</content>

    <title>Surviving as a Vegan in a World of Omnivores: Relational Fractures in Shared Practices</title>
    <updated>2025-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research documents the role of the misalignment of practice elements in practice habituation and change. We extend this literature by demonstrating the understudied role of practice relationality. Locating our empirical work in veganism, a context that encompasses a bundle of interrelated practices, we show how people who adopt veganism manage the relationality of their food-related practices (e.g., eating, cooking, and shopping for food) during shared moments. Building on interview, secondary, and netnographic data on people who pursue veganism, we demonstrate that changes in shared practice performances cause relational fractures. We pinpoint relational fractures that hinder practitioners from smoothly performing shared practices in three contexts: co-performance, co-learning, and the marketplace. To repair practice relationality, vegan consumers enact four relational competences, which we identify as decoding, decoupling, divesting, and chameleoning. These competences can repair some relational fractures while aggravating others. When vegan consumers fail to acquire any competence, however, they end up reverting to their old omnivorous performances. Our paper contributes to practice theory by conceptualizing the role of practice relationality in practices, introducing the concept of relational competence as a necessary element for performance (re)rehabituation, and demonstrating the role of practice intelligibility in the co-performance of shared practices.</content>

    <title>Concealing Prices: How Delayed Price Disclosure Influences Consumer Purchase Decisions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article presents the first systematic empirical investigation into a longstanding question in retail: Is it better to display prices upfront or reveal them later in the purchase process? Two large-scale field studies demonstrate that delayed price disclosure can either increase or decrease sales. Supporting lab studies reveal that one plausible explanation is that a price delay allows price beliefs to shift consumers’ internal reference prices upward or downward, creating either positive or negative price expectation disconfirmations when prices are revealed. When consumers anticipate prices should be expensive (e.g., from premium brands or upscale stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations upward, making purchases more likely when prices are revealed. Conversely, when consumers anticipate prices should be inexpensive (e.g., sales events or discount stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations downward, making purchases less likely when prices are revealed. Our findings offer retailers actionable insights on when to reveal prices to customers. In doing so, the authors contribute to the literature on price obfuscation and challenge the conventional wisdom that shopping experiences should always minimize friction. (184 words)</content>

    <title>Is Prevention Better Than Cure? Effects of Cyber Risk Disclosures on Shareholder Response to Breaches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As digitalization increases firms’ exposure to cyber risks, corporate disclosures about how these risks are managed are becoming more common and influential. This study examines 1,912 breach incidents affecting public companies to understand how shareholder reactions differ depending on the type of cyber risk strategies disclosed. We find that, although breaches generally lead to stock price declines, firms that previously disclosed preventive strategies, such as efforts to avoid breaches, experience significantly smaller losses in market value. Conversely, disclosing mitigative strategies, focused on damage control after a breach, amplifies the negative impact. These effects arise from shareholders’ loss aversion: They respond more favorably to firms perceived as trying to prevent harm rather than simply reacting to it. These findings suggest that managers should focus cyber risk disclosures on credible, prevention-oriented strategies to build investor confidence and minimize financial fallout after a breach. Additionally, our findings advise against using cyber risk disclosures as tools for impression management. Managers should ensure these disclosures accurately reflect the firm’s cyber risk management practices, as failing to do so can undermine the economic benefits of emphasizing preventive strategies.</content>
