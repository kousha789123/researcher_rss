    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Measured as yield spreads against Treasury securities and AAA corporate bonds, the convenience premium of newly issued agency MBS averages more than half of the long-term Treasury convenience premium. The agency MBS convenience premium and issuance amount vary negatively with mortgage rate, consistent with a prepayment-driven channel. Placing agencies into conservatorship in 2008 and introducing liquidity regulations in 2013 significantly affected MBS convenience premium, consistent with government guarantee and regulatory treatment channels. Analyses of dispersion of dealers’ prepayment forecasts, seasoned MBS, and investors’ MBS holdings deliver further economic implications for agency MBS as safe assets.

    <title>News-based investor disagreement and stock returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate investors’ disagreement regarding firm news and assess its ability to predict stock returns. Specifically, we quantify firm-level investor disagreement through the volume-volatility elasticity surrounding firm news; higher elasticity is associated with less investor disagreement. Intuitively, disagreement introduces additional trading motives that are not driven by price changes, weakening the connection between volume and volatility. Our findings indicate that investor disagreement on news negatively predicts cross-sectional returns. We also present empirical evidence aligned with the theoretical predictions of a recently developed model by Atmaz and Basak (Journal of Finance 73 (3): 1225–1279 2018) that the negative disagreement-stock relation strengthens when the optimism effect dominates the uncertainty effect. Importantly, this predictive relationship remains robust after controlling for news heterogeneity, other volume- and volatility-based measures, and alternative channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how global changes in information acquisition costs through disclosure technologies affect price informativeness. To explore this issue, we examine worldwide adoptions of centralized electronic disclosure systems, which significantly reduce the cost of and broaden access to financial disclosures. Consistent with theory, we show a significant reduction in private information acquisition around earnings announcements as a result of these adoptions. These effects are most pronounced in countries with the most substantial reductions in information acquisition costs and where we find more significant decreases in informed trade. Overall, we highlight an important, unintended cost of broadening access to financial disclosures through technology adoptions.</content>

    <title>Distributional Growth Accounting: Education and the Reduction of Global Poverty, 1980-2019</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the role played by education in the reduction of global poverty. I propose tools for identifying the contribution of schooling to economic growth by income group, integrating imperfect substitution between skill groups into macroeconomic growth decomposition. I bring this “distributional growth accounting” framework to the data by exploiting a new microdatabase representative of nearly all of the world’s population, new estimates of the private returns to schooling, and historical income distribution statistics. Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education. Because they ignore the distributional effects of schooling, standard growth accounting methods substantially underestimate economic benefits of education for the global poor.</content>

    <title>Architectural Learning in the Professional 3D Printing Ecosystem: Proxies and the Complementarity Space</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To realize complementary value in ecosystems, organizations engage in architectural learning, which involves searching for interdependencies and specifying interactions with external complements. In this article, we explore how this process differs when potential complements are not yet fully interoperable and complementarity is emergent. We report on a longitudinal case study of a 3D printer company that shifted from producing inexpensive personal desktop 3D printers to the professional 3D printing ecosystem. The company intensively used proxies (stand-in components) to support learning about interdependencies with potential external complements. This process informed internal component adaptations and the design of boundary resources that enabled third-party complementors to make their components fully complementary. From this case, we theorize this process in terms of shaping a complementarity space: a problem space in which organizations iteratively draw on proxies to provide resources such as interfaces and tools to transfer complementary capabilities to other organizations. We discuss theoretical implications for research on architectural learning and ecosystems.</content>

    <title>Multilocation, Dynamic Staff Planning for a Healthcare System: Methodology and Application</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multilocation, Dynamic Staff Planning for a Healthcare System: Methodology and ApplicationThis study develops and implements a robust optimization model for dynamically assigning anesthesiologists across multiple hospitals in a large health system. The model addresses uncertainty in surgical demand by incorporating a three-stage decision process: presurgical location assignments, midhorizon on-call deployment, and day-of realization of overtime or idleness. The authors formulate the problem as a multistage robust mixed-integer program and solve it efficiently using a novel nested column and constraint generation algorithm. The approach accounts for location-specific constraints and fairness in on-call duties using historical data to estimate demand uncertainty with a calibrated trade-off between optimality and robustness. Implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the model reduced annual staffing costs by 12% or roughly $800,000 compared to existing practice. The framework is generalizable to other staffing problems in healthcare and provides operational insights on the value of forecast accuracy, location flexibility, and equitable workload distribution.</content>

    <title>Eliciting Advice Instead of Feedback Improves Developmental Input</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most organizations encourage employees to provide feedback to one another to support learning, personal growth, and career advancement. However, employee feedback often fails to improve performance because it lacks concrete, specific guidance. We provide a temporal explanation for why workplace input processes routinely fail to produce valuable and concrete developmental insights: they are insufficiently focused on the future. In this paper, we theorize and demonstrate that encouraging input providers to think about the future leads them to produce more concrete developmental input. Across a large scale, preregistered field experiment (n = 27,432 comments) and two laboratory studies (n = 806), people provide more concrete and actionable developmental input when they are prompted to provide future-looking “advice” rather than “feedback,” a common method of soliciting input in organizations. The effect of soliciting advice on input concreteness was mediated by providers’ future focus. Moreover, in a follow-up study, such concrete input was assessed by independent raters as more useful. These findings highlight the role of temporal orientation in driving the content of developmental input. In doing so, our data suggest that individuals and organizations have the potential to promote higher-quality developmental input by attending to the temporal orientation that their input systems encourage.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: Funding for the laboratory experiments was provided by Harvard Business School.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03207 .</content>

    <title>Reducing Racial Disparities in Consumer Credit: Evidence from Anonymous Loan Applications</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a unique experiment of anonymizing online loan applications to test whether race-blind screening procedures reduce racial disparities in consumer credit. With names on applications, minority applicants are 10% less likely to receive online loan offers and receive worse offer terms than otherwise identical majority applicants. Anonymizing applications reduces such disparities substantially. High-income minority applicants benefit more than low-income minorities. We show that the racial disparities are not driven by differences in credit demand. Overall, anonymous loan applications reduce racial disparities in access to credit by increasing lender reliance on objective credit risk measures.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This research is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its Social Science Research Thematic Grant [Grant MOE2019-SSRTG-024].

    <title>How to Motivate Fundamental Innovation: Optimal Interactions Between Entrepreneurs, Venture Capitalists, and the Government</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the roles of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists (VCs), and the government in financing fundamental innovations, defined as those with a positive social value net of development costs but often with negative net present values to innovating firms, for example, a vaccine against COVID-19. We first analyze the case where the entrepreneur, with or without VC financing, develops innovations. We then analyze government support of innovation and the government’s choice between subsidies and innovation prizes. We further analyze the optimal interactions between government and VC financing, showing that the government may optimally channel subsidies partially through VCs, thus rationalizing government-funded VCs. Overall, our paper provides a framework for the optimal choice of sectors and technologies to receive government support (e.g., subsidies included in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022) and how any government support should be structured to best motivate innovation.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a second-price auction with a flexible reserve price, where the reserve price for the top bidder is not fixed but rather determined as a function of all losing bids. We show that when bidders are ex ante heterogeneous, a second-price auction with an optimally chosen flexible reserve price not only generates strictly higher expected revenue than that of a second-price auction with any fixed reserve price but is also revenue-maximizing among all mechanisms that implement discrimination-free social choice functions. We also provide an axiomatic characterization of all second-price auctions with a flexible reserve price. Finally, we discuss real-life implementation.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Oesterreichische Nationalbank [Grant 19021] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72203148].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04584 .</content>

    <title>Too Good To Go: Combating Food Waste with Surprise Clearance</title>
    <updated>2025-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies surprise clearance as an innovative business model to increase store profit and reduce food waste. A store holding surprise clearance sells “surprise bags” composed of surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. At the time of ordering, consumers are uncertain about the quantity of food items included in a surprise bag. We model surprise clearance and compare it with both no clearance and transparent clearance, which sets a transparent unit clearance price based on the amount of surplus food after regular sales. We find that surprise clearance achieves the highest store profit and induces the most store production among the three selling schemes. Although both clearance schemes have the ability to eliminate store waste, the store effectively does so under surprise clearance but deliberately does not under transparent clearance. In fact, transparent clearance may generate even more store waste than no clearance. Further, both clearance schemes exacerbate the problem of consumer waste compared with no clearance, and despite zero store waste, surprise clearance generates the most consumer waste among the three schemes. If clearance sales target a consumer segment with a sufficiently low valuation of consumption, both clearance schemes reduce total waste, and surprise clearance is a win-win-win solution that maximizes store profit and social welfare and minimizes total waste among the three schemes. However, there are circumstances under which both clearance schemes fail to reduce total waste, and surprise clearance may generate the most total waste.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: L.

    <title>Setting the Stage: Line Managers' &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Orientation as an Antecedent to Perceived &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The field of strategic human resource (HR) management has shown an increasing focus on how employees perceive and react to their organization's HR practices. In this perspective, employees are not passive recipients of HR policies or mere observers of their managers' HR implementation strategies. Rather, their perceptions play a critical role in shaping organizational culture and fostering high‐performing workplaces. However, important questions remain regarding how line management roles shape not only employees' assessments of their work environment but also their perceptions of HR effectiveness. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, we argue that line managers' compliance‐ versus commitment‐focused orientations influence employee appraisals of threats and challenges in their jobs. These appraisals, in turn, shape how employees evaluate the effectiveness of their organization's HR practices (i.e., perceived HR effectiveness). Using qualitative data from focus groups and a multilevel quantitative research design, we find evidence supporting our hypotheses, showing that line managers' HR orientations significantly influence employees' cognitive appraisals and subsequent perceptions of HR effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical contributions and offering practical recommendations for improving the implementation of HR practices.</content>

    <title>Does Tax-Benefit Linkage Matter for the Incidence of Payroll Taxes?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyse earnings responses to six large payroll tax and income tax reforms in France. Our findings indicate full pass-through to workers when there is a strong and transparent link between contributions and expected benefits. In contrast, employer payroll taxes with no tax-benefit linkage exhibit limited pass-through to workers, while income tax nominally borne by employees show nearly full pass-through. Together with a meta-analysis of the literature, we interpret these results as empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that tax-benefit linkage matters for the incidence of payroll taxes. In the absence of such linkage, our findings suggest that the individual-level incidence of payroll taxes aligns with their statutory incidence.</content>

    <title>Virtually Even: Status Equalizing in Distributed Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In distributed organizations, perceived status differences between workers are ubiquitous and harmful. Yet research suggests that once they are formed, status beliefs in organizations become entrenched in hierarchies and are hard to dismantle. In an inductive qualitative study, we observed how established status differences between remote and in-person workers in distributed organizations dissolved during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone began working remotely. We use these data to theorize a novel status-equalizing process through which remote workers came to see themselves on an “equal playing field” with their in-person peers. We theorize how this status equalizing occurred through workers’ changing their “in-person default” use of technology—that is, their new behavior challenged embedded cultural practices that had treated the in-person workplace experience as the standard, normal, and valued perspective, implicitly guiding how employees used technology. Workers adopted new and more inclusive technology practices—including the use of asynchronous communication, greater codification of work, and virtual socializing—which resulted in remote workers perceiving new and more equal communication standards, access to information, and opportunity for social connection. As a result, these workers reported feeling less negatively stereotyped and treated more fairly in their virtual interactions with colleagues, fostering feelings of inclusion and deepening relationships across the previously established status divide. At a time when many organizations are grappling with the challenges of distributed, remote, and hybrid work, our research illuminates how inclusive technology practices can help nullify entrenched status imbalances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bayesian Learning for Data-Driven Stochastic Optimal ControlStochastic optimal control (SOC) provides a principled approach to dynamic decision making under uncertainty. It models the transition of the system state with a dynamic equation driven by randomness, with the assumption that the distribution of randomness is known. However, in practical problems, modeling randomness frequently depends on data or observations, which introduces uncertainty regarding the distribution of randomness. To address the data-driven SOC problem, in “Episodic Bayesian Optimal Control with Unknown Randomness Distributions,” Shapiro, Zhou, Lin, and Wang propose a new approach that incorporates Bayesian learning with optimal control in an episodic manner. They show the convergence and convergence rate results for their approach. They also develop an efficient computational method for a class of problems that have convex cost functions and linear state dynamics.</content>

    <title>Closer to Home: A Structural Estimate-Then-Optimize Approach to Improve Access to Healthcare Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geographic inequalities in healthcare access extend beyond rural–urban divides to include socioeconomic, racial, and other disparities. Proximity to hospitals, clinics, healthcare providers, and pharmacies varies widely, posing a challenge in deciding where to strategically locate such facilities. Demand for each service depends on local population health, individual preferences, provider capacity, and other factors. This study introduces a novel structural estimate-then-optimize (SETO) framework, combining structural demand estimation using a modified Berry–Levinsohn–Pakes approach that accounts for provider capacity with a choice-based optimal facility location model to maximize health service utilization. Our methodology is illustrated with a case study on the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program in California, a public–private partnership that administered millions of COVID-19 vaccinations. Demand estimates indicate that residents of socioeconomically vulnerable communities are more sensitive to travel distances to pharmacy-based vaccination sites. Strategically adding 500 retail stores serving lower-income communities increases predicted vaccinations by 2.9% overall (770,000 additional vaccinations statewide) and by 5.3% in the least healthy neighborhoods. Our integrative SETO approach outperforms heuristics that allocate resources based on current vaccination rates, existing service gaps, population density, or predicted demand. The case study demonstrates the importance of (1) accounting for heterogeneity in estimating demand and (2) selecting partnerships to complement existing networks with spatially heterogeneous supply and efficiently fill service gaps. Our study provides a systematic approach to optimize healthcare delivery networks, using publicly available aggregate data while accounting for individuals’ preferences, highlighting the value of combining a structural demand model with prescriptive analytics.This paper was accepted by Stefan Sholtes, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06274 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how Indigenous Zapatista‐influenced activists enact temporal sovereignty to resist corporate water extraction, challenging dominant Western organizational temporalities. Through qualitative in‐person research of the 2021 occupation of a water bottling plant in Mexico, I explore how activists transformed the site into a non‐capitalist communal space, creating alternative temporal rhythms rooted in Zapatista principles such as ‘walking at the pace of the slowest’ and collective autonomy. The findings reveal how activists rejected efficiency‐driven deadlines, prioritized ecological cycles over productivity metrics, and fostered relational well‐being through inclusive decision‐making. These practices culminated in what I conceptualize as ‘time‐less organizing’ – a framework for non‐capitalist horizontal organizing that operates outside conventional time logics. The study contributes to the management and organizing literature by theorizing temporal sovereignty as resistance to imposed temporalities, extending critiques of stakeholder theory by exposing how corporate temporal constraints perpetuate marginalization, and demonstrating how communities reclaim autonomy through alternative temporal practices. The findings challenge assumptions of time as a resource to be managed for efficiency gains, offering future avenues of research for addressing grand challenges through decelerated and relational approaches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We note that while the institutional environment determines the actions and structures of constituent organizations, there are still limited insights available in the literature on the nature and process of interactions between key stakeholders in ambulance services, especially as they respond during a significant crisis. This study specifically examines how a positive social exchange between senior leadership, managers, and frontline staff, accompanied by changes to the leadership style and HR practices, resulted in significant service transformation. An in‐depth qualitative case study design was used to interview 52 frontline staff and leaders from the UK National Health Service's (NHS) Ambulance Service over a prolonged period of 8 months (October 2020 to May 2021). Interviews and secondary data were abductively analyzed, showing how changes to HRM and leadership practices shaped service transformation's content, process, and logic. The findings suggest that an iterative social exchange between the key social actors in the Ambulance Trust led to adaptations to the nature of HRM and leadership practices, which positively impacted the changes to service delivery, leading to service transformation and improved health and well‐being of paramedics. Our conceptual framework contributes to the literature by integrating how the use of agency, new HRM, and leadership practices in the context of institutionalized structures can result in service transformation. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational socialization and the practice of onboarding new hires are central human resources functions. However, traditional socialization theory and practice were built on assumptions that are increasingly misaligned with today's work context. We identified four current, emerging, and future work trends that characterize the evolving landscape surrounding organizational socialization: technological advancement, the expansion of remote work arrangements, rising societal loneliness and mental health challenges, and aging workforce demographics. Collectively, these trends have contributed to dramatic shifts in the context and performance of work, as well as the expectations that employees and organizations hold for one another. Accordingly, we argue that these shifts require a renewed examination of the organizational socialization process that reflects contemporary realities such as the move away from stable, physically co‐located, psychologically anchored work toward boundaryless, tech‐mediated, and transient work arrangements. Our review presents a future‐forward look at organizational socialization through the lens of these societal and workplace shifts. We identify newcomer adaptability and connection as emergent critical factors for the future of onboarding. Through this lens, we offer practical implications for human resource practice and invite future research that advances our understanding of organizational socialization in today's context.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unemployment differentials are greater between countries in the euro area than between U.S. states. In both regions, net migration responds to unemployment differentials, though the response is smaller in the euro area compared to the United States. We use a multi-country DSGE model with cross-border migration to quantify Mundell’s hypothesis that labor mobility could substitute for independent monetary policy in a currency union. While not as effective as independent monetary policy, increased labor mobility reduces business cycle fluctuations for most countries in the euro area. However, Mundell’s conjecture does not hold uniformly. For countries that primarily face demand shocks, labor mobility stabilizes inflation and unemployment and improves welfare. If supply shocks are dominant however, labor mobility increases the cost of being in a currency union by magnifying inflation volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate executives often use metaphors, particularly those derived from war imagery, when communicating their strategic intentions. This study examines the influence of metaphorical framing in corporate communication, particularly its effect on analyst reactions to firms’ acquisition announcements. We theorize and analyze the impact of metaphor families that either emphasize or downplay competition while considering the diverse source domains from which these metaphors originate. We propose a theoretical framework that integrates conceptual metaphor theory with the risk-as-feelings perspective, suggesting that certain metaphors can evoke visceral perceptions of danger. Our findings reveal that using metaphors in acquisition announcements generally elicits negative reactions. Notably, metaphors from the competition family, especially war-related ones signifying competitive aggression, evoke stronger adverse reactions. The detrimental impact of war language substantially diminishes in contexts where aggressive competition is expected. We contribute to strategic communication research by highlighting the contingent influence of metaphorical framing on audience reactions, emphasizing the importance of metaphor families, source domains, and contextual factors.Funding: J.

    <title>Fat Tails in Human Judgment: Empirical Evidence and Implications for the Aggregation of Estimates and Forecasts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How frequent are large disagreements in human judgment? The substantial literature relating to expert assessments of real-valued quantities and their aggregation almost universally assumes that judgment errors follow a jointly normal distribution. We investigate this question empirically using 73 data sets from four different sources that include over 169,000 estimates and forecasts. We find incontrovertible evidence for excess kurtosis: that is, of fat tails. Despite the diversity of the analyzed data, varying in how much uncertainty there is in the quantity being assessed and varying in the level of expertise and of sophistication of those making the assessments, we find surprising consistency in the frequency with which an individual judgment is in large disagreement with the consensus. Fitting a generalized normal distribution to the data, we find most estimates for the shape parameter to be between 0.9 and 1.6 (where 1 is the double-exponential distribution and 2 is the normal distribution). This has important implications, in particular for the aggregation of expert estimates and forecasts and for the construction of confidence intervals. We describe optimal Bayesian aggregation with fat tails and propose a simple average-median average heuristic that performs well for the range of empirically observed distributions.This paper was accepted by Manuel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04006 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The perils of legitimacy threats for CBAs are widely acknowledged in the literature. However, prior research has focused on legitimacy threats stemming from factors not in the direct control of MNEs. In this study, we explore if and how acquirers’ CSI salience, a legitimacy threat stemming directly from the past actions and behaviors of the focal firm, influences a critical international expansion decision—the level of ownership obtained in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs). Drawing on neo-institutional theory, we argue that CSI salience reduces the level of ownership obtained in CBAs as it captures more stakeholder attention and is factored into their legitimacy evaluations. In addition, we examine how characteristics of the host country’s legitimating environment may attenuate or accentuate the legitimacy threat from CSI as they reflect how host country stakeholders notice, assess, and respond to CSI and the capacity of host institutions to monitor and enforce compliance. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 16,650 CBAs by 10,738 unique acquirers, and offer valuable insights into the interplay of CSI salience, legitimacy, and CBA ownership to research and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bonuses are notoriously used to motivate workers. How effective are they at doing so, and might there be unintended consequences? We investigated the effectiveness of bonuses based on game profitability on the motivation of video game developers by examining specific bonus characteristics that align with advice derived from expectancy theory. We also investigated if bonuses encouraged or discouraged moral engagement and corner‐cutting behavior through their effects on work motivation as conceptualized through self‐determination theory. Company data on bonus characteristics coupled with surveys from 1024 game developers in a video game company indicated that the size of the last received bonus did not influence current work motivation. Uncertain probability of getting the next bonus installment was related to a lack of motivation, while more certain probability was related to higher intrinsic motivation. The probable size of the next bonus was related to lower external regulation and to higher intrinsic motivation, contrary to predictions from most motivation theories. Both probability certainty and bonus size probability were indirectly negatively associated with moral disengagement and corner‐cutting behaviors via decreasing amotivation and external regulation. Overall, results show that the bonus system in this company had limited effects on motivation and on discouraging deviant behaviors and point to how such systems can be improved using advice from theory.</content>

    <title>The Dual Effects of Algorithmic Management on Platform Workers: An Attribution Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research often highlights the negative consequences of algorithmic management (AM) for platform workers. By contrast, less is known about what, how, and when AM may produce both positive and negative outcomes. Drawing on attribution theory, this study examines the dual effects of core AM dimensions (i.e., algorithmic recommending, restricting, evaluating, and rewarding) on platform workers' perceptions of work overload and customer‐oriented service behavior. A two‐wave survey of 213 online platform workers in China reveals that algorithmic recommending and rewarding improve customer‐oriented service behavior and reduce work overload through AM commitment attributions. However, AM control attributions link algorithmic restricting, recommending, and evaluating (the latter two at low algorithmic transparency) to increased work overload. Algorithmic transparency moderates these effects, reducing the negative impacts of AM through AM control attributions. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the dual effects of core AM dimensions and provide practical insights for platforms seeking to enhance service quality while supporting worker well‐being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain comprising a downstream retailer and multiple complementary suppliers. Suppliers can form coalitions to jointly invest in sustainable production technologies and enhance the product’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) level. Coalition members benefit from efficiency gains through shared knowledge and information about green production. The retailer sources from these coalitions and sells the product to heterogeneous consumers. We develop a game-theoretical model and use the notion of Nash stability to characterize equilibrium coalition structures and firms’ optimal decisions under three profit allocation rules. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Forming supplier coalitions can benefit all stakeholders (including the retailer, suppliers, and society) but achieving such a win–win–win outcome hinges on two factors: the market’s consciousness rate (i.e., the proportion of socially conscious consumers) and the efficiency gains from coalition formation. (2) The grand coalition that maximizes the retailer’s profit and CSR level is not always stable due to free-riding behaviors. In particular, less efficient suppliers may defect to avoid the cost of sustainable innovation while still benefiting from the high innovation efforts of others (i.e., cross-coalition free-riding). (3) On the supply side, adopting the Shapley value allocation rule exacerbates within-coalition free-riding by assigning greater profit shares to less efficient suppliers. However, it also reduces their incentive to defect, thus enhancing coalition stability. Moreover, greater total efficiency and a smaller efficiency gap among suppliers further improve the stability of the grand coalition. (4) On the demand side, the impact of increasing the market’s consciousness rate is non-monotonic. Improperly influencing consumer awareness may destabilize coalitions and produce unintended consequences, suggesting that the retailer must proceed with caution.</content>

    <title>A Deep Demand Response Program for Local Electricity Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The decarbonization of power systems facilitates the  electrification of appliances, many of which can be operated in a flexible way. Demand response (DR) programs can exploit this flexibility with retail price adjustment, thereby addressing several operational challenges. In this paper, we address the welfare optimization problem of local utilities that procure electricity for their customers at the wholesale market. We demonstrate how DR programs can be designed for local electricity systems where electricity demand and its response to temporary price changes is unknown. For this purpose, we address a novel and complex pricing problem—pricing under unknown, time-interdependent, and discontinuous demand—leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning. Using a numerical case study calibrated on Californian electricity market data, we show that such a “Deep DR program” helps to identify effective prices that improve social welfare. The performance of the program is consistently positive across a variety of system conditions. We further demonstrate that our approach beats Time-of-Use tariff-based benchmarks already after five and a parametric benchmark after 19 simulation days, on average. Second, we provide novel insights regarding an important but frequently overlooked aspect of DR program design: The length of the notification interval, that is the timespan for which future prices must be set in advance. We find that the timing of price information is important and that longer notification intervals can improve social welfare. Finally, we provide insights into DR price setting and find that DR prices co-move with wholesale market prices but are lower for longer notification intervals and shorter event sequences. The presented Deep DR program provides an example of how advances in machine learning-based algorithms can help to meet the complex operational requirements of future local electricity systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Managing Quality Risk in a Decentralized Supply Chain: Contractual Incentives and Product Recall Insurance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a two-echelon decentralized supply chain where the probability of selling nondefective products depends on the supplier’s quality improvement and the buyer’s inspection efforts. Products assembled from defective components cause a recall that leads to external failure costs for the buyer. Both players’ efforts are not contractible and it is a challenge to align inspection and quality-improvement efforts in a decentralized supply chain. We find that a procurement contract can provide preventive incentives that induce high inspection efforts and enhancing incentives that enable the supplier to credibly commit to high-quality components. However, these contractual incentives only align two players’ efforts under certain conditions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that introducing a product recall (PR) insurance requirement into a standard procurement contract provided by the buyer can complement enhancing incentives and lead to quality improvement in components. More importantly, as PR insurance can improve the flexibility of risk-sharing arrangements between the supplier and the buyer, we show that it can also serve as a coordinating role in improving the performance of a decentralized supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Warehouse Assortment Selection: Minimizing Order Splitting in E-commerce Logistics</title>
    <updated>2025-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Order splitting is one of the key issues in the e-commerce order fulfillment process. It increases operational costs, elevates carbon emissions, and compromises customer satisfaction. This paper focuses on determining the product assortments to store within the multi-warehouse logistics network to minimize the total number of split orders subject to cardinality constraints. We show that this minimizing split orders (MSO) problem is NP-hard and demonstrate that even finding an optimal order fulfillment strategy with a given assortment selection is NP-hard. To further analyze the MSO problem, we introduce a concept termedthe second-order dominant indexing rule. This indexing rule corresponds to a group of demand distributions, under which we are able to characterize the structure of the optimal assortment selection for various scenarios. In particular, when assortment overlapping is prohibited, the optimal selection can be explicitly derived. When the demand exhibits a total nested structure, an optimal selection is non-overlapping with more popular products allocated to larger warehouses. We also bridge the two-warehouse order splitting minimization problem with the single-warehouse assortment selection problem in the literature. Building upon this connection, we propose an Extended Marginal Choice Indexing (MCI) policy, which is proven to achieve optimality when the demand has a second-order dominant MCI. In addition, we propose an Iterative Improvement Heuristic that refines any existing assortment selection. The efficiency of the proposed heuristics is validated by extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating that the extended MCI policy performs near-optimally even when customer demand is not ideal, and both heuristics outperform the best benchmark in existing literature. Additional experiments on real-world data further confirm their effectiveness and scalability. Finally, we extend our findings to a two-tier multi-warehouse scenario with a back-end warehouse.</content>

    <title>Profit Implications of Judgmental Adjustments to Forecast Inputs: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we report the results from a large-scale field experiment at a spare parts retail chain that considers whether allowing merchants to override forecast inputs to an inventory algorithm improves profits. Although the judgmental forecasting literature has studied extensively whether judgmental adjustments improve forecast performance, causal empirical evidence is missing in regard to whether judgmental adjustments improve bottom-line profits. Our results show that judgmental adjustments to the forecast input increase profitability by 4.92% on average compared with relying on automation without human intervention. We find that the well-established motivation-opportunity-ability framework provides clear insight into when judgmental adjustments improve profits, by examining heterogeneity in our data regarding stock-keeping unit margin, lifecycle, and size of supplier. Our data set also allows for examining both forecast accuracy and profits. We empirically support the wisdom from the judgmental forecasting literature that forecast performance need not translate to profit performance, calling attention to the need to consider operational performance beyond forecast accuracy as an end in itself.This paper has been accepted by Felipe Caro for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06321 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends the canonical harm reduction approach to a wider set of applications, including conservation. We develop an economic model to illustrate the trade-offs inherent to harm reduction, weighing the benefits of reducing harm against the risk of drawing those previously abstaining into consumption, and identify contexts where it is not applicable. Using sequential campaigns with embedded experimentation that enables measurement, we market a harm reduction solution in the context of water conservation. We show that a smart irrigation controller that efficiently maintains stigmatized ornamental landscapes appeals to the heaviest irrigators and generates large and long-lasting individual and social benefits: cost recovery in six months and water savings covering another household’s basic needs. We find no evidence it cannibalizes abstinence (lawn removal) or increases irrigation by conservation-prone individuals. Our conceptual and measurement framework provides a foundation for implementing and evaluating harm reduction well beyond the typical drug and public health contexts.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Quality in Context: Experience-Relevant Consumption Context Influences Product Ratings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Experience with a product is shaped by two things: (i) aspects of the product itself and (ii) aspects of the environment in which the product is consumed. This paper documents evidence that when translating their experiences into ratings for products, consumers overly attribute their experience to products, and under-attribute experience to context—the environment in which the product is consumed. First, 218,918 ratings collected from REI.com demonstrate that ratings for cold-weather gear (products designed to keep people warm) are positively correlated with temperature: These products get lower ratings when the weather is cold and higher ratings when the weather is warm, controlling for climate and season. Ratings for other products (e.g., bicycles, tents, skis) are not affected by temperature. This effect generalizes to other products and contexts both in the REI data (e.g., rain jackets and rain) and in a laboratory experiment. The paper also identifies attenuating conditions for this effect. Specifically, the effect seems to be smaller when reviewers explicitly consider context, and when context information is made more accessible, while rating. These findings inform several possible interventions for platforms, which are assessed and validated.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Growth Department: The Emerging Role and Impact of Chief Growth Officers and their Cross-Functional Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates “growth departments,” an increasingly popular governance structure in modern organizations. Using a multimethod approach across five studies, the authors examine the purpose, responsibilities, and effectiveness of these departments. In Studies 1A and 1B the authors analyze job ads to understand the growth department. Study 2 expands this understanding via interviews with Chief Growth Officers. Findings show that the growth department is a cross-functional unit distinct from marketing and sales departments, designed to unify and orchestrate growth throughout the organization. Studies 3 and 4 assess their impact on firm outcomes, drawing from boundary spanning and organizational ambidexterity theories. In startups, hiring a growth leader results in better advancement through funding rounds, a key proxy of startup growth, than hiring a marketing or sales leader (Study 3). In public firms, a powerful growth department improves performance metrics including Tobin’s Q, cash flow, and ROA (Study 4). The paper also identifies contingency factors influencing the growth department’s effectiveness, including the growth leader’s past sales or marketing experience and the firm’s strategic emphasis on exploration versus exploitation. Together, the findings advance theory and practice by clarifying what growth departments are, how they operate, and under what conditions they enhance firm performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Breaking Up to Move Forward: The Value Gains of Alliance Terminations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior alliance research in marketing has largely focused on factors enhancing alliance stability. Yet also alliance terminations can be valuable. They are intricately linked with firms’ strategies to (re)allocate resources to create financial value. The basic premise of this study is that an alliance termination increases firm value when investors interpret it as the firm’s intention to reallocate resources towards more promising market opportunities. The key question is how investors arrive at that interpretation. The prior literature suggests that the diversity of a firm’s alliance portfolio informs investors about its resource (re)allocation strategy. This argument relies on three assumptions: (1) firms face uncertainty, (2) resources invested in the terminated alliance are redeployable, and (3) the diverse alliance portfolio offers resource reallocation opportunities. These assumptions form the basis for the development of a contingency framework. Moderators are identified to capture (1) firms’ competitive environment and exposure to macroeconomic risk, (2) the fungible nature versus alliance-specificity of resources invested in the terminated alliance, and (3) efficiency and overlap with the other alliances in the portfolio. An event study of 427 firm-alliance termination announcements during 1985-2020 supports the predictions. The combined findings shed new light on alliance terminations, contributing to marketing theory and practice.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Too Painful to Donate: Why Don’t People Donate to Critical Illness Campaigns?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charitable donations are increasingly shifting to online fundraising platforms, where numerous campaigns are displayed simultaneously. This research examines the role of campaign titles in attracting online traffic in this competitive environment, focusing specifically on a major category of medical fundraising. While fundraisers commonly include the names of critical illnesses in campaign titles (critical illness titles), our findings suggest that this emotion-laden driver can negatively impact donation performance. A series of seven studies—combining secondary data, field and controlled experiments—provides robust evidence for this undesirable critical illness title effect. Moreover, three studies offer mediation and moderation evidence showing that anticipated distress drives this effect. Donors tend to avoid critical illness title campaigns, opting instead for alternatives that still allow them to express empathy. However, this effect diminishes when there is a non-distress cue or when the alternatives are non-justifiable. This research contributes to the literature on charitable crowdfunding, prosocial behavior, and title effect, offering important practical implications for fundraisers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: More Ads, More Viewers? Analyzing Behavioral Shifts from Advertising Permissions to Live Streaming Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There has been little exploration on how audience content consumption may change in response to advertising permissions on live streaming platforms. Ads are utilized by brands to generate revenue through ad exposure, but is this benefit thwarted by the reduction of audience consumption of content? Using a dataset containing over 12 million observations in the live streaming space and a difference-in-differences estimation approach, we study the effects of a policy intervention by a live streaming platform which provided (some) streamers the ability to display mid-roll advertisements (MRAs). Although the ad avoidance literature infers that ad-supported content should be viewed unfavorably by audiences, our results indicate that providing the mere ability to introduce MRAs has a notable positive effect on live streaming content consumption (average viewership and total hours watched). We discover that a viable explanation for this response is through increases in broadcasting airtime, stream frequency (somewhat) and quality by streamers after the intervention, as these adjustments are drastically easier to implement in a live streaming setting when compared to more “traditional” forms of media. We further explore heterogeneity in these effects in relation to initial success, streaming tenure, content activity, culture (of the streamer), and impact across time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We compare execution quality of six brokerage accounts across five brokers by generating a sample of 85,000 simultaneous market orders. Commission levels and payment for order flow (PFOF) differ across our accounts. We find that execution prices vary significantly across brokers: the mean account‐level round‐trip cost ranges from 0.07% to 0.46%, excluding any commissions. The dispersion is due to off‐exchange wholesalers systematically giving different execution prices for the same trades to different brokers. Across brokers, variation in PFOF does not explain the large variation in price execution. We provide several suggestions for more informative disclosures on execution quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the dynamics of internal forecasting in multi‐location firms and the relations between forecast characteristics and investment. Using U.S. Census microdata on plant‐level growth expectations, we find that plants within multi‐location firms make forecasts that are both more certain and less accurate than those of standalone plants. We provide evidence suggesting that headquarters infers uncertainty from inter‐plant forecast disagreement, and that headquarters is able to facilitate the use of relevant information held by one plant but applicable to another. Differences between peer and focal plants' forecasts predict forecast errors and relate to investment decisions at the focal plant, suggesting that information from multiple sources is integrated into capital allocation decisions. Headquarters' heavier use of peer plant forecast information when focal plants are more uncertain likely weakens focal plant managers' incentives to consider extreme scenarios when forecasting.</content>

    <title>Voice Flow to Managers or Voice Flow Around Managers: Voice From the Shopfloor in Iran</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The extant voice literature is largely Anglo‐American and often assumes formal, management‐designed or union voice channels, which may not always be accessible to employees in non‐Western, autocratic developing countries where silence is often forced upon employees. Given this unfavorable context for voice, how do employees navigate managerial constraints to assert their agency? Drawing on ethnographic research in a multi‐site manufacturer of auto parts in Iran, we show how formal voice channels are set up by employers, how voice flows through these management mechanisms, the employee experience of the process, and how employees respond by developing their own informal channels. The findings highlight the importance of viewing voice through a dynamic, context‐bound lens, and how, if voice does not flow to managers, it can flow around them. We show how management's espoused effort to promote voice resulted not only in less voicing but also counterproductive work behavior. These findings advance a contextualist perspective of employee voice, highlighting how local contexts shape worker agency in articulating their voices, and offering key insights for HRM practices, especially in designing strategies that account for cultural and organizational dynamics.</content>

    <title>Bunch of jerks: How brands can benefit by reappropriating insults</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands are increasingly finding themselves on the receiving end of negative labels from a variety of sources. While sometimes warranted, many of these negative labels feel like unwarranted or uncivil insults. Brands generally respond to such undeserved degradation by ignoring the insult, denying the insult, or perhaps apologizing to the insulter. This research explores another potential strategy: reappropriating the insult. We reveal that reappropriation—an intentional act of verbatim self‐labeling with an externally imposed negative label—can garner unexpected benefits for brands, including greater advertisement click‐through rate, interest, and more positive attitudes. The advantage of reappropriation is driven by perceptions of the brand's confidence and humor and is specific to situations in which the reappropriated insult is perceived to be unjustified and ultimately benign in nature. This work contributes to our understanding of how brands can recover from negative events and how reappropriation operates uniquely in an unexplored marketplace context. We also provide a novel recovery tactic for brand managers facing certain types of hostility.</content>

    <title>From Workplace‐Based to Work‐Related Violence: Reframing &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Research and Practice in the Era of Growing Tensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Violence at work has traditionally been conceptualized in human resource management (HRM) as workplace‐based violence—an episodic, interpersonal issue occurring within bounded organizational settings. This perspective article adopts the term work‐related violence as a more expansive and timely framing, encompassing physical, psychological, and symbolic harm related to work but occurring across dispersed geographies, identities, relationships, and organizational arrangements. It contends that prevailing HRM frameworks remain ill‐equipped to address these fragmented and often unacknowledged harms, particularly as work becomes increasingly hybrid, precarious, and digitally mediated. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, we advance a multilevel and multistakeholder analytical framework that theorizes violence as relational and spatially unbounded, embedded across micro (identity and employees' lived experience, and psychological factors), meso (organizational culture, HRM systems and silencing mechanisms), and macro (regulatory, ideological, and institutional) levels. The framework further identifies underexplored domains of violence within HRM, including employee‐perpetrated violence, ideologically motivated aggression, and the critical role of community‐based interventions in mitigating harm. In doing so, the article contributes to HRM theory by problematizing the spatial and behavioral assumptions underpinning conventional approaches to workplace violence. We argue for a broadened research and practice agenda that expands the field's analytical and operational capacity, calling for the development of HRM models that are structurally, institutionally, and ideologically attuned to violence emerging from inequality, institutional complicity, and the broader political economies of contemporary work.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The implementation of servitization as a business strategy remains a significant challenge for firms seeking to offer integrated product‐service bundles. Despite the growing body of research in the servitization literature, an integrative framework for explaining the recurring failures in servitization efforts has yet to emerge. Through a qualitative meta‐analysis of empirical evidence documented in existing case studies, we develop a process theory that examines the tensions between product and service businesses during the service business development process. Our study identifies three common servitization failure modes, highlights the contributing factors across various stages of servitization, and establishes causal links between structural elements and behavioral outcomes to explain the heterogeneity in service business performance. By adopting a process perspective, we provide a more nuanced understanding of servitization dynamics, offering new insights that complement and extend established theories on firm growth and capability development. We conclude by discussing managerial implications for firms pursuing a servitization strategy and outlining future research steps to test and further refine the proposed theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many regulations aim to promote coordination among creditors in bankruptcy by ex post restricting their ability to exit distressed firms. However, such restrictions may harm creditors’ ex ante incentives to stay invested, thereby worsening coordination outcomes. We build a dynamic coordination model to show how this force shapes creditor runs, bankruptcy filings, and regulation designs. Intriguingly, filing for bankruptcy early, thereby preserving more assets for latecomers, can prolong firm life. Furthermore, regulators’ clawbacks on prebankruptcy repayments can be superior to firms’ commitment to early bankruptcy filing. Our analysis generates implications for automatic stay, avoidable preference, bank failures, and seniority structure. (JEL D83, G33, G38)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey a large, representative sample of retail investors in China to elicit their memories of stock market investments and their return expectations. We merge these survey data with administrative transaction data to test a model in which investors selectively recall past experiences to form their beliefs. Our analysis uncovers new facts about investor memory and highlights similarity-based recall as a key mechanism of belief formation in financial markets. A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns. Recalled experiences can explain cross-investor variation in return expectations and, in our setting, dominate actual experiences in their explanatory power. In the transaction data, we confirm that recalled experiences are reflected in investors’ trading decisions through a belief channel.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study shows that competition drives corporate innovation under intense environmental regulatory pressure. Using the nonattainment status of U.S. counties as an exogenous variation in regulation, we find that competition spurs green innovation as firms respond to stricter policies. Firms are particularly motivated to innovate in clean technology when operating in pollution-intensive industries, facing high relocation costs, and possessing a strong history of innovation. Regulation-driven green innovation allows firms to differentiate their products, enhance their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reputation, and attract more corporate customers, leading to higher sales growth, increased market share, and improved profitability, although not necessarily higher valuation. Stricter regulations in competitive environments not only curb pollution but also serve as a catalyst for sustainable long-term innovation. These findings emphasize the vital role of environmental regulations in promoting sustainable practices and operational benefits, underscoring the importance of well-designed policies to drive long-term economic and environmental progress.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00600 .</content>

    <title>Can Lower(ed) Expert Opinions Lead to Better Consumer Ratings?: The Case of Michelin Stars</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Expert opinion exerts tremendous influence on the purchase journey, but its effect on overall consumer experience is ambiguous because it can give rise to both “expectation” and “reputation” effects. This paper explores the effect of expert opinions on consumer experience via the lens of consumer reviews in the restaurant industry, where the expert opinions are conveyed by Michelin stars. The paper uses a unique data set based on the Michelin Guide for Great Britain &amp; Ireland from 2010 to 2020. The data include consumer reviews on TripAdvisor for all restaurants that were awarded Michelin stars during this period and a large pool of potential control restaurants. We apply two synthetic control–based methods to estimate the effect of Michelin star changes on the sentiment and content of consumer reviews. We find that decreases in Michelin stars improve consumer review ratings. We examine three potential explanations for this finding. First, the positive expectation effect of lowered expert opinions outweighs the negative reputation effect. Second, there could be a change in the customer mix. Third, there may be a changes on the supply side, for example, in service levels. We find support for the first explanation, rule out the second, but cannot entirely rule out the third. The analysis of review content further shows that a loss in Michelin stars leads consumers to become less focused on value and become less demanding regarding service. We discuss the implications of our findings for restaurant managers, the Michelin Guide, and other businesses that provide experience goods.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04302 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the consequences of monetizing a marketplace for product promotion within a digital platform, specifically the Giveaways program on Goodreads.com. Using a natural experiment and fine-grained platform data from 2016 to 2020, we examine how introducing a fixed entry cost for content creators affected both supply and demand in this two-sided market. Our findings reveal significant shifts in marketplace dynamics after monetization: (1) a substantial decrease in overall program participation, particularly among indie publishers and self-published authors, leading to increased market concentration; (2) reduced genre diversity, with popular genres becoming more dominant at the expense of niche categories; and (3) intensified promotional effects, characterized by higher review volume but lower average ratings for participating books. Analysis of review text suggests an increase in consumer-book mismatches as a potential mechanism driving this outcome. Our study advances platform economics by demonstrating how entry costs reshape marketplace composition and affect value creation in two-sided markets. These findings inform platform design and policy, particularly for markets with horizontally differentiated products and heterogeneous consumer preferences.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the Dutch national e-infrastructure [Grants 2024/ENW/01764012, EINF-1825, EINF-7628, and EINF-7946] and the European Union [Next Generation EU funds Component M4.C2, Investment 1.1—CUP J53D2300462] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The web appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01390 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-oriented AbstractGamification systems such as badge rewards are widely used to encourage user engagement, yet their effectiveness depends heavily on design. This study investigates how badge volume, variety, and valence—the 3Vs—influence knowledge sharing on platforms such as Stack Overflow. Using a structural hidden Markov model with a copula correction for endogeneity, we uncover that badge volume and valence significantly increase both the quantity and quality of user contributions, particularly among inactive and experienced users. However, excessive variety in badge types reduces long-term engagement, suggesting that diversification may dilute motivational focus. Counterfactual simulations reveal that reducing the difficulty of earning answer badges (“volumizing”) enhances contributions, whereas altering the rarity of high-valence badges (e.g., gold) often backfires. These insights highlight the importance of aligning gamification mechanics with user psychology and engagement trajectories. Practically, platforms can personalize badge offerings, offering easy wins for newcomers and prestige rewards for experienced users. Aligning badge incentives with content goals (e.g., Python questions) and visually showcasing rare badge collections can further deepen engagement. Our findings offer actionable guidance for platform designers to refine gamification systems that balance challenge, recognition, and motivation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using signal detection theory, we meta‐analyzed existing research testing the classification performance of supervised machine learning (ML) models applied in human resource (HR) contexts. Our meta‐analysis contained 6605 effect sizes cross‐nested by study (N1= 249) and unique dataset (N2= 152). We conducted separate cross‐classified multilevel modeling analyses predicting six different classification performance indices. We tested hypotheses regarding the effects of algorithm type, sample size, number of predictors used, the number of outcome classes, and outcome class imbalance on model classification performance. Boosting and random forest algorithms performed best across classification performance indices. However, both come at relatively great computational expense, and solutions can be difficult to explain. Decision trees were the best‐performing algorithms with relatively lower computational expense and easily interpretable solutions. We found limited evidence for the effect of sample size on classification performance. We found stronger support suggesting that using more predictors to train machine learning models results in better classification performance, but only when those predictors have substantive value. Finally, we found strong evidence that outcome class imbalance influences classification performance indices differently. More imbalanced outcome classes are associated with higher accuracy scores, which can be misleading, and lower precision and F1 scores, which may be better estimates of true classification performance. Our findings provide valuable insights into developing ML tools better suited to support HR functions.</content>

    <title>&lt;scp&gt;HPWP&lt;/scp&gt; Climate, Collective Well‐Being, and Firm Performance in &lt;scp&gt;SMEs&lt;/scp&gt;: An Exchange Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on High‐Performance Work Practices (HPWP) typically examines employees' aggregated HPWP perceptions and their impact on organizational outcomes. We argue that variability in these perceptions also matters due to its impact on collective exchange relationships. We integrate the aggregated (mean) level HPWP perceptions and variability regarding HPWP perceptions to identify four HPWP climate types: a strong HPWP climate (high mean, low variability) and three weak HPWP climates—unshared high (high variability, high mean), shared low (low variability, low mean), and unshared low (high variability, low mean). Using data from 695 employees in 72 Belgian SMEs, we find that a strong HPWP climate is optimal as it relates to the highest collective social and lowest economic exchange levels, which are—in turn—associated with high collective affective organizational commitment (CAOC) and subjective firm performance. However, it is also linked to high collective exhaustion, showing that aligning organizational and workforce interests is not always possible. As regards the weak climates, they are suboptimal, with shared low climates being particularly detrimental. Even though these climates can be fruitful for firm performance, they are linked to lower levels of CAOC, which can be harmful for SMEs that rely heavily on the effort and engagement of their employees. These findings show that investing in HPWP is fruitful for SMEs, even though they have limited financial means, and that SMEs also need to handle the inherent tensions present in HRM.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Sourcing Procurement Management: A Closed-Form Mean-Variance Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the post-pandemic era, multi-sourcing is rapidly becoming the preferred approach for companies to drive optimized cost, quality and turnaround times. However, multi-sourcing systems present a myriad of challenges in designing an effective planning model. In this paper, we propose a robust capacity planning model with multiple supply sources, and demonstrate how the capacity plan can be efficiently solved via a parsimonious mean-variance approach. We apply the max-min criterion to design a distributionally robust multi-source capacity plan. We use a new approach to deriving a set of optimality conditions on the robust capacity plan. These conditions enable us to derive the worst distribution, the optimal robust capacity vector, and the worst-case expected profit in closed form. The new approach bypasses numerous tedious intermediate procedures in the traditional distributionally robust optimization literature and allows us to derive the optimal solution based on exogenous cost parameters. This closed-form solution appears to be hitherto unknown and has important ramifications for the multi-sourcing capacity planning problem. Our findings reveal that, despite the complexity of multi-sourcing, the worst-case demand scenario can be reduced to justn+ 1 distinct outcomes, structured by two key sequences derived from supplier characteristics. The optimal capacity plan has a clear structure–allocations align with the midpoints between these demand scenarios. Surprisingly, we also find that most of the robustness benefits of a full supplier portfolio can be achieved by engaging just the two best-matched sources. This provides a practical and cost-effective road map for robust capacity planning in multi-sourcing environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of memory on economic choices can be essential, but empirical evidence of the link between them remains scarce. This study examines whether the retrieval of memories related to economic recessions affects the changes in the bias in management forecasts. Using the 2008 financial crisis as a memory trigger and focusing on annual management earnings forecasts issued for fiscal years ending between 2002 and 2018, we find that chief executive officers (CEOs) with more long-term memories of leading through past recessions and those with more intense recent memories of the financial crisis embed greater pessimism in their forecasts after the financial crisis. These findings support the retrieved-context theory in human memory as well as the availability heuristic and the recency effect in psychology. Further analyses show that it takes about three years for the increased pessimism in management forecasts to return to the pre-crisis level, mainly for CEOs with more memories of past recessions. These findings suggest that memory retrieval may delay managers’ learning after the financial crisis. Our study offers new insights into the role that memory plays in managers’ decision making.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04053 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rent‐to‐own (RTO) firms rent products for a periodic fee and allow a renter to buy the rented product at specified buyout prices during the rental. Accurately capturing the renters' decision process, as well as their ownership and rental utilities, is required for determining their willingness to pay buyout prices in different periods. We develop a modular framework that cleanly separates solving a renter's decision problem from estimating utility. We consider renters with varying degrees of sophistication and alertness to buyout offers. Using washer, dryer, and mattress data from a prominent RTO firm, for each decision model, we estimate utilities and the probabilities of abandoning the rental, neglecting the buyout offer, and considering the buyout offer. We find that renters have short decision horizons and frequently neglect buyout offers. Also, their utilities remain stable throughout the rentals. Moreover, renters who opt for rental agreements with higher rental fees or longer terms tend to have higher ownership utilities. Based on our counterfactual analyses, for washer or dryer renters, we suggest initiating efforts to remind renters of buyout offers. In contrast, for mattresses, whose renters more frequently consider buyout offers, we find that profits would be increased by setting prices higher.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Executive compensation is a key topic in management research, focusing on how firms use incentives to align CEOs’ decisions with shareholders’ interests. Yet, we know little about the influence of stock-option compensation—a major component of CEO pay—on CEO decisions facing adverse events involving multiple stakeholders. Analyzing U.S. medical device recalls between 2004 and 2017, we examine how stock options induce CEOs to protect their existing wealth while pursuing potential gains. We find that CEOs with greater current option wealth are more likely to adopt short-term impression management (IM) tactics, such as strategically timing recalls and maintaining silence in press releases, which can harm shareholders and stakeholders. In contrast, CEOs with higher prospective option wealth are less inclined to employ these tactics. Moreover, negative media scrutiny discourages CEOs with substantial current option wealth from using IM tactics, and encourages those with greater prospective option wealth to further avoid them. These findings highlight the powerful role of executive compensation, particularly stock options, in shaping CEO decisions facing adverse events.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on an exemplary case of strategic HRM in a nonprofit social care provider responding to a recruitment and retention crisis, this article offers evidence for a multi‐actor, recursive model of HRM implementation. We examine how multi‐actor engagement with strategic HRM reinforces or modifies intended HRM, and how this engagement is shaped by external and internal contextual pressures in nonprofit social care organizations. Through an in‐depth qualitative study, we shed light on the internal process dynamics that not only engender a shared understanding of intended HRM strategy and practice among key organizational actors (convergence) but also allow for local deviation (divergence) that forges a more adequate response to workforce challenges. Our study contributes to theory on the social dynamics of HRM implementation within wider institutional contexts while highlighting the limits of a business‐oriented HRM system for delivering a sustainable workforce within social care.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal and Self Selection of Service Type in a Queueing System where Long Service Postpones the Need for the Next Service</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a make-to-order system with a finite set of customers. Production is stochastic with a nonlinear dependence between the ordered quantity and the production rate. Customers may have to queue until their turn arrives, and therefore their order decisions interact. Specifically, while being served, customers are aware of the queue length and choose one of two order quantities (or service types). The time to the next replenishment (their activity time) is stochastic and depends on the order quantities. A customer is inactive during service and while waiting in the queue. We refer to the type of service with a greater ratio of expected activity to service time as “more efficient”. In the centralized case, the system is interested in maximizing the steady-state average number of active customers, which is referred to as the efficiency of the system. We show that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal, but the optimal strategy can be approximated well by selecting one of three threshold strategies which depend on the number of inactive customers. In the decentralized case, each customer acts to maximize the fraction of time she is active. We observe that individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: When the queue is long, individuals tend to choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short service in this case. This makes the system difficult to regulate. However, we show that simply removing the less efficient service significantly increases efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of a replenishment recommendation system on inventory management in convenience stores. We collaborate with a convenience store chain to implement the system in some locations while leaving others unchanged. We find that the introduction of the system increases reorder points and reduces order size, leading to a 2.9% improvement in service levels without requiring additional inventory and without negatively affecting sales or revenue. Additionally, it reduces managers’ daily ordering time by 36.5%, thus enhancing overall store efficiency. Our study also highlights the important role of managerial discretion in complementing the system. For popular items, managers often adjust recommendations by placing orders ahead of any recommendations or increasing the recommended quantity. Interview with managers suggests that they override in anticipation of demand increases that the system has yet to detect. For non-popular items, given their slow-moving nature, managers are more likely to postpone recommendations due to concerns over excess inventory. Our study demonstrates that, for small retailers without the resources to invest in advanced algorithms, even a basic moving average algorithm can be effective by allowing managerial discretion to complement the algorithm in responding to demand fluctuations. This also underscores the need to enhance recommendation accuracy for both top-selling items, given their significant contribution to sales, and the typically overlooked less-popular items due to their slow-moving nature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice ModelingChoice modeling is an important topic that underlies a wide range of applications involving human decision making, and it traces its roots to the 1920s. Matrix balancing has an equally long history and wide applicability (e.g., in transportation and mobility networks). Recently, its celebrated Sinkhorn’s algorithm has been instrumental in the efficient approximation of optimal transport distances. However, the two topics have largely developed independently. In “On Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Choice Modeling,” Qu, Galichon, Gao, and Ugander establish extensive connections between a class of Luce choice models and a common matrix-balancing problem. They leverage these connections to resolve open problems on the convergence of Sinkhorn’s algorithm for nonnegative matrices, characterizing its global linear convergence rate in terms of the algebraic connectivity and deriving the sharp asymptotic rate. The connections established in this paper between two seemingly unrelated topics help the transmission of ideas and lead to further interesting results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines whether and how politicians’ ideologies influence corporate taxation. Our tests exploit the implementation of the 1978 Reform and Opening-up policy in China that significantly weakens the communist ideology. Using textual analyses of city secretaries’ speeches, we first establish that secretaries who joined the communist party after 1978 have a weaker communist ideology. We next show that, in the postreform period, firms in cities whose secretaries joined the communist party after 1978 have significantly lower effective tax rates than those of firms with secretaries joining the communist party beforehand. Further analyses reveal that tax benefit provisions and tax enforcement are the mechanisms through which secretaries’ ideologies influence corporate taxation.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [General Research Fund 17502219].

    <title>When Rivalry Backfires: How Individual Skill and Risk of Status Loss Moderate the Effects of Rivalry on Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing rivalry research finds that people try harder and perform better when competing against their rivals. However, are there conditions under which rivalry can harm performance? We integrate rivalry theory with regulatory fit theory to propose two moderators of rivalry: individual skill and situational risk for status change. We test our predictions using data from software programming contests involving more than 4.6 million competitive encounters across 16,846 software developers (“coders”) to examine the causal effects of rivalry and the conditions under which it may backfire. We find that, on average, coders who are randomly assigned to compete against a field of competitors with whom they share a rivalrous history exhibit higher performance, above and beyond other established drivers of performance in competition. Importantly, however, this positive effect of rivalry is moderated by (1) coders’ skill level, such that rivalry is more beneficial for more skilled coders and is harmful for less skilled coders, and (2) coders’ risk of experiencing a status change, such that coders who face a possible status loss exhibit decreased performance when competing against rivals. Thus, we extend research on rivalry by revealing the conditions under which it can harm performance, which is vital to understanding its role in organizations.This paper was accepted by Sameer Srivastava, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00344 .</content>

    <title>Does Speculation in Futures Markets Improve Commodity Hedging Decisions?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of traditional versus selective hedging strategies in commodity futures markets. Traditional hedging aims solely to reduce spot price risk, whereas selective hedging also seeks to enhance returns by predicting movements in commodity futures prices. We construct selective hedges using a range of forecasting techniques, from simple historical averages to advanced machine learning models, and evaluate their performance based on the expected mean-variance utility of hedge portfolio returns. Out-of-sample results for 24 commodities do not favor selective hedging over traditional hedging as the former increases risk without delivering additional returns. These findings are robust across various hedge reformulations, expanding estimation windows, and rebalancing frequencies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This research was supported by grants from Audencia Business School and Auckland University of Technology, awarded during A.

    <title>Too Much, Too Soon, for Too Long: The Dynamics of Competitive Executive Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine executive compensation in a general equilibrium model with dynamic moral hazard, where executives' outside options are endogenously determined by equilibrium market compensation. Firms provide incentives through compensation packages featuring deferred payments as “carrots” and termination as “sticks.” Crucially, the effectiveness of termination as an incentive device is undermined by the outside options available to executives. As individual firms fail to internalize the effect of their compensation design on these endogenous outside options, the equilibrium is generally inefficient. Compared to shareholder‐value‐maximizing compensation packages, executives are paid too much, too soon, and keep their jobs for too long.</content>

    <title>Near-Histories and Strategy Emergence: A Microhistorical Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even when anticipated strategic decisions or actions do not materialize, they can still set in motion emergent dynamics with collateral consequences that lead to profound strategic consequences. Adopting a microhistorical lens, we elucidate the dynamics of these processes by focusing on two largely dismissed near-history episodes in the relatively recent history of the Nokia Corporation. We develop a process model that elaborates on how anticipatory reactions, mobilization of networks, revision of expectations, and the emergence of a new strategic direction can eventually have significant strategic consequences. By focusing on this poorly understood but important form of strategy emergence, we contribute to a fuller understanding of strategy emergence and the role of strategic agency therein. Furthermore, we extend the conversation on near-histories from focusing on what could have happened to examining their concrete consequences. Our findings show that near-history episodes are not merely precursors or impediments to actualized events but productive forces shaping organizational trajectories in ways that realized events alone cannot explain. In so doing, our microhistorical analysis has major methodological implications for historically oriented strategy research and for our understanding of causal complexity in strategy emergence.</content>

    <title>Estimating Welfare Effects in a Nonparametric Choice Model: The Case of School Vouchers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop new robust discrete choice tools to learn about the average willingness to pay for a price subsidy and its effects on demand given exogenous, discrete variation in prices. Our starting point is a nonparametric, nonseparable model of choice. We exploit the insight that our welfare parameters in this model can be expressed as functions of demand for the different alternatives. However, while the variation in the data reveals the value of demand at the observed prices, the parameters generally depend on its values beyond these prices. We show how to sharply characterize what we can learn when demand is specified to be entirely nonparametric or to be parameterized in a flexible manner, both of which imply that the parameters are not necessarily point identified. We use our tools to analyze the welfare effects of price subsidies provided by school vouchers in the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. We find that the provision of the status quo voucher and a wide range of counterfactual vouchers of different amounts can have positive and potentially large benefits net of costs. The positive effect can be explained by the popularity of low-tuition schools in the program; removing them from the program can result in a negative net benefit. We also find that various standard logit specifications, in comparison, limit attention to demand functions with low demand for the voucher, which do not capture the large magnitudes of benefits credibly consistent with the data.</content>

    <title>Reallocative Auctions and Core Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When selling goods like wireless spectrum or electricity contracts, designers often opt for core-selecting mechanisms—i.e., those that induce outcomes in the core—in order to balance revenue and efficiency goals. But increasingly, auctions—such as the FCC's Incentive Auction and those explored for natural resources—seek to reallocate goods, not just sell them. We show that when bidders can both buy and sell, substitutability among goods is no longer sufficient or necessary for core selection. In particular, in these environments, core selection can fail even with a single good and positive revenue, and can succeed even when some or all bidders view goods as complements. Instead, we show that the key feature that determines core selection is heterogeneity among the bidders. With too much heterogeneity, reallocation mostly realizes pre-existing gains from trade among the bidders, and core selection fails. With limited heterogeneity, most gains from trade among the bidders are created by the quantity auctioned, and a core-selecting mechanism is possible.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Hidden Fees to Open Books: An Empirical Examination of the Impact of Hospital Price Transparency Rule on Costs and Quality of Medical Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, the lack of competition within the healthcare market is notably influenced by the opacity of service pricing, leading to unchecked price increases without improvements in service quality. The hospital price transparency rule, implemented on January 1, 2021, seeks to address this by requiring the disclosure of prices, aiming to stimulate competition and lower costs. Yet, the policy’s effect on hospital charges and consumer behavior remains largely unexplored. This study employs a difference-in-differences analysis of inpatient data from Florida hospitals to assess the impact of the Federal price transparency rule on hospital charges and patient decision-making, leveraging the phased compliance of hospitals with the rule.Our analysis reveals that while the price transparency rule does not broadly reduce hospital charges, it leads to lower charges for self-pay patients opting for elective procedures who are sensitive to price and can shop for better deals. This reduction is driven by both lower unit prices and decreased care complexity as hospitals compete to attract cost-conscious patients. Furthermore, our findings indicate that after the implementation of the policy, patients choose hospitals that not only comply with the rule but also charge below the market average, particularly benefiting those seeking elective services. This suggests that price transparency primarily aids cost-aware patients with the flexibility to choose more affordable providers. Our research underscores the nuanced impact of price transparency on healthcare costs and patient welfare, offering valuable insights for future healthcare policy development.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: On Matching Efficiency in Online Labor Markets for IT Services: The Role of Project Description</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many online labor markets face challenges in matching service providers with employers because of the high uncertainty in online environments compared to traditional ones. While prior studies have mostly focused on the uncertainty that employers face with service providers, our study explores the uncertainty service providers face when selecting projects on which to bid. Specifically, our study examines the role of project description in the Call for Bids (CFB) that describes the services requested by employers, in shaping service providers’ bidding behavior and the matching between service providers and employers. Drawing upon transaction cost economics, we examine three key dimensions of project descriptions: (a)codifiability(provisions of detailed procedures), (b)flexibility(provisions of renegotiation opportunities), and (c) provisions ofoutcome standards. We first use machine learning to quantify the three key dimensions based on unstructured textual information. Second, we use Bayesian mediation analysis and a randomized experiment to examine the role of these three key dimensions in matching efficiency and to explore the mediating role of three key bid attributes (i.e., number of bids, average price of bids, average quality of bids). Findings reveal:First, codifiability is positively associated with matching efficiency by reducing the number of bids received by employers.Second, flexibility is negatively associated with matching efficiency by raising the average price of bids.Third, outcome standards are positively linked to matching efficiency by reducing the number, albeit improving the average quality, of bids. By focusing on the project description and analyzing the textual content of CFB, our study contributes to the literature by enhancing the matching efficiency of online labor markets and facilitating the contracting of IT services in online labor markets.</content>

    <title>A Ridesharing Platform with an Oversupply of Drivers: Different Assigning Rates or Commission Rates for Drivers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a ridesharing platform's choice among two quality-dependent compensation schemes for drivers when the market is oversupplied, that is, there are more drivers than riders at a given time. We examine an information asymmetric context in which drivers (high and low cost) have different costs to improve service quality, which is private information. The platform designs a menu of contracts for drivers to reveal their type. In the assigning-differentiation compensation scheme, the platform offers contract options with different assigning rates, that is, the probability of receiving an order assignment, different service-quality levels, but the same commission rate. In the commission-differentiation compensation scheme, the platform offers contract options with different commission rates, different service-quality levels, but the same assigning rate. We find that the oversupply degree, measured as the ratio of the number of drivers to the number of riders, plays a critical role in the platform's choice of scheme. The platform's expected profit is higher under the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when the oversupply degree is high (low). We also determine the effect of the driver-type distribution on the platform's choice of scheme. When the difference in the drivers’ costs is small, the platform is more likely to choose the commission-differentiation scheme when there are more high-cost drivers. When the cost difference is large, first, the platform is more (less) likely to choose the commission-differentiation (assigning-differentiation) scheme, but then, it is more (less) likely to choose the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when there are more high-cost drivers. Further, high-cost drivers are indifferent to either compensation scheme, whereas low-cost drivers are better off under the assigning-differentiation (commission-differentiation) scheme when the oversupply degree is low (high). In addition, we find that both the platform and (low-cost) drivers prefer the assigning-differentiation scheme, a win-win outcome under certain conditions. Finally, we show that the platform can provide a subsidy to mitigate potential misalignment with the drivers.</content>

    <title>Not Good Enough, but Try Again! The Impact of Improved Rejection Communications on Contributor Retention and Performance in Open Knowledge Collaboration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Producing high-quality content through open knowledge collaboration presents a dilemma. Successful quality control requires rejecting contributions that do not align with the aims of an open knowledge collaboration system, yet rejections demotivate new contributors from attempting further contributions. Building on research on the regulation of behavior in online communities and on organizational selection, we theorize how the way rejections are communicated affect new contributors. We leverage a change to the rejection notices used by the Stack Overflow community question-answering service to study the issue empirically. First, we use a regression discontinuity in time design to construct a natural experiment to estimate the average treatment effect of more informative rejection notices on the retention of initially rejected contributors. The results show that notices that better explain the reason for rejecting a contributor’s initial question—and therefore reduce uncertainty about the outcome if the contributor tries again—increase retention by approximately 21.7 percentage points. Second, we use a mediation model to study mechanisms by which more informative rejection notices affect contributor performance. We find that more informative notices affect contributor performance through selection rather than performance improvement. Additional contributors, who are retained because of the more informative rejection notices, ask more questions, on average, whereas we find no evidence of individual contributors improving their performance in terms of the quality or quantity of their contributions. Overall, the results suggest that rejection communications offer low-cost interventions to mitigate the trade-off between new contributor retention and the quality of contributions in open knowledge collaboration.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the Fox School of Business, Temple University (Young Scholar Interdisciplinary Forum) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02720 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Different Effects of Mass-Media Marketing and Personal Sales Budgets across the Life Cycle of B2B High-Tech Start-ups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In their early life-cycle stages, business-to-business (B2B) high-tech start-ups face severe challenges in establishing their first customer relationships. To generate business growth, they must convey the value of unfamiliar, innovative, complex offerings to customers, using the limited resources at their disposal. Prior research has not examined the different roles of mass-media marketing and personal sales communications in this challenging endeavor, despite principal differences between these activities in start-up contexts. To help B2B high-tech start-ups allocate financial resources to mass-media marketing and personal sales communications across early and later stages of their organizational life cycle, this article presents a longitudinal survey study involving founders of B2B high-tech start-ups. The findings indicate that start-ups spending a larger share of their budget on personal sales (i.e., higher personal sales expense ratio) exhibit stronger performance in earlier stages of their life cycle but weaker performance in later stages; however, still in later stages, these expenditures enhance certain performance metrics. Conversely, start-ups spending a larger share of their budget on mass-media marketing (i.e., higher mass-media marketing expense ratio) show stronger performance in later stages but weaker performance in earlier stages. High-tech start-ups can leverage these findings to improve their budget allocation and ensure persistent growth.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Customer Data Privacy Stewardship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To address rising customer concerns about data privacy, some firms adopt strong privacy practices. However, such investments are costly, both financially and in terms of limiting the ability to leverage customer data, leading many firms to treat privacy primarily as a risk to be managed. The current research proposes a different perspective, in which data privacy is a strategic opportunity. Specifically, this article introduces the concept ofcustomer data privacy stewardship: a customer-facing, strategic approach to responsible data privacy management. With three multimethod studies, the authors establish a positive relationship of privacy stewardship with performance at firm, brand, and customer levels. Critically, the strength of this beneficial relationship depends on customers’ perceptions of firms’ motives, such that data dependence weakens the relationship, but brand affinity strengthens it. The relationship also varies with perceptions of data risk; a history of data breaches strengthens the relationship, and strong industry-level protections weaken it. Customers’ perceptions of privacy benevolence and privacy concerns mediate the positive relationship between privacy stewardship and performance too. By moving beyond risk mitigation to emphasize strategic value creation, this conceptualization advances privacy research and offers actionable guidance for aligning privacy stewardship with public perceptions of firm motives and data risk.</content>

    <title>A Review of Market Categorization Research: An Evolutionary Framework Across Perspectives and Stages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market categorization—the process of grouping organizations perceived as sharing core attributes and serving similar demand profiles—has become a central topic in management research, offering a theoretically rich and interdisciplinary domain of study. Scholars have examined how market categories form, develop, and decline, drawing from structural, strategic, and constructionist perspectives to explore their role in shaping firms, industries, and institutions. Despite substantial advancements, research on market categorization remains fragmented, leading to inconsistent conceptualizations, theoretical isolation, and a lack of cross-stage integration. Studies often focus on individual stages while neglecting their interconnections or apply discipline-specific lenses that limit theoretical synthesis and hinder the accumulation of knowledge. To address these gaps, we conducted a systematic review of 195 articles published between 1999 and 2024, synthesizing insights across stages and perspectives to develop an evolutionary framework of market categorization. Our analysis identifies three cross-perspective mechanisms—categories as constraints, enablers, and actor-shaped entities—that underpin categorization processes and explain their underlying dynamics. In addition, by conceptualizing transitions between categorization stages, we provide a unified foundation for future research. This evolutionary perspective clarifies the role of market categorization in shaping economic and organizational landscapes while bridging theoretical divides and guiding future empirical inquiry.</content>

    <title>Leader Anthropomorphizing Behavior Toward Robots: Conceptualization, Measurement, and Implications for Perceived Objectification and Workplace Deviance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As robots become more integrated into the workplace, leaders are increasingly engaging in behaviors that anthropomorphize robots. Given that this form of leader behavior remains undertheorized, we conceptualize it as leader anthropomorphizing behavior toward robots (LABR)—an observable behavior through which leaders endow robots with human-like characteristics. Although practical wisdom and previous studies have highlighted a prevailing optimism about adopting LABR to manage human–robot teams, such optimism may be premature. Drawing on objectification theory, we develop a model that uncovers the detrimental effects of LABR on employees who observe such behavior. To test our model, we developed and validated a LABR scale (Study 1) and conducted five subsequent studies (Studies 2a–5) using vignette-based experiments and field surveys. The results showed that employees who observed LABR were more likely to perceive themselves as being objectified by their leaders, which in turn increased their likelihood of engaging in workplace deviance. By theorizing LABR and revealing its potential dark sides, we contribute to the literature on leader behavior, robot anthropomorphism, human–robot teams, and objectification.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing the performance of intralogistics operations, that is logistics operations within facilities such as manufacturing plants, order fulfillment warehouses, ports and terminals, and retail stores, is critical in fulfilling customer expectations. Traditional decision-making for intralogistics operations is based on historical data, typically collected over long-range intervals with significant processing delays. However, nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) applications are used to gather detailed real-time data to make dynamic decisions. These new data sources provide challenges and opportunities for operations management. We provide an overview of prominent IoT technologies in four domains: Manufacturing, warehousing, ports and terminals, retail, and other emerging areas. We discuss four prominent research questions (cutting across multiple application domains) that can be addressed using new data sources, along with the methodological approach and managerial insights that may result. In particular, IoT can improve the tracking and tracing of objects, equipment, and humans and provide rapid alerts, allowing managers to make real-time decisions and improve asset use, uptime, and profitability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents aim to restrict corporate illegality, yet its prevalence highlights inconsistencies in enforcement mechanisms. To explore this issue, we examine how newspapers reduce corporate illegality by imposing ethical norms on firms. Analysing data from firms in 29 countries, we find that higher newspaper reach is only moderately associated with lower levels of corporate illegality due to key boundary conditions. Specifically, we leverage institutional anomie theory as a framework to identify and test three ways in which economic institutions constrain newspapers' ethical norm‐setting role. The negative association between newspaper reach and corporate illegality is weakened in countries with strong cultural pressure to succeed or pervasive economic penetration into newspapers. However, firm‐level shareholder orientation does not moderate this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized analyses of media landscapes and the role of economic institutions in undermining social control processes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study analyzes 6 million civil judgments in China from 2014 to 2018, documenting gender disparities that disfavor female litigants. We investigate the impact of an open justice reform that mandated courts to broadcast legal proceedings live on a centralized online platform. By exploiting variations in its implementation across courts and over time and employing both difference-in-differences and Bartik IV approaches, we find that gender disparities in chances of winning decrease as broadcast intensity increases. Analysis of the textual content of judicial decisions provides further evidence that these changes in judicial outcomes stem from altered judge behaviors (i.e., attention and effort) under enhanced judicial transparency. Our results demonstrate how information technology shapes judges’ conduct, underscoring its broader potential to improve accountability in public institutions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers introducing asymmetric privacy in the design of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and digital currencies more generally to preserve the privacy of money spent while keeping the benefits of digital records for money received. It is shown that this feature would help minimize real distortions between consumers, firms, and financiers while enabling tax optimization and better access to external financing. Protecting the privacy of consumers is desirable from a welfare and efficiency standpoint as long as there exist noticeable privacy concerns. Implementing asymmetric privacy is technologically feasible, using, for instance, zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy tools.This paper has been accepted by Lin William Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06830 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Passive bond funds provide predictable demand for newly issued corporate bonds included in popular indices. By issuing index-eligible bonds, firms can take advantage of this passive demand and improve bond characteristics unrelated to index eligibility. To this end, firms issue a disproportionate number of bonds with face value just sufficient to be included in major bond indices. Higher passive demand is associated with larger bonds. Following an increase in the index size threshold, some firms withdraw from the bond market while others respond by issuing larger bonds at the new threshold.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01999 .</content>

    <title>Third-Party Software Development Kit Utilization and Mobile App Market Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the highly competitive mobile market, third-party vendors located outside the purview of hosting mobile platforms are becoming major suppliers of functional tool kits for mobile app development and innovation. However, app developers face challenges in navigating the use of third-party software development kits (SDKs) to enhance app performance. Drawing on the platform ecosystem literature, this study examines the roles of third-party SDKs, platform owners, and mobile app developers from a boundary-spanning perspective, emphasizing their respective contributions to shaping the functional value of third-party SDKs as boundary objects. By analyzing a longitudinal data set of 335,958 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play, we find that integrating more third-party SDKs can significantly boost daily active users, especially when tool-type SDKs are utilized. However, this positive effect diminishes following platform updates that redefine platform boundaries and as developers gain more platform-specific experience. This study highlights the importance of balanced governance in platform ecosystems to sustain market growth, offering actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and industry leaders in shaping the future of mobile app markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School districts historically approached conflict resolution from the perspective that suspending disruptive students was necessary to protect their classmates, even if this caused harm to perceived offenders. Restorative practices (RP)—focusing on reparation, accountability, and shared ownership of disciplinary justice—are designed to address undesirable behavior without harming students. We study Chicago Public Schools’ adoption of RP and find that suspensions and arrests decreased, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test score value added, ruling out meaningful average declines. We estimate a 15 percent decrease in out-of-school arrests, consistent with RP substantively changing student behavior. (JEL D63, D74, D91, I21, I28, J15, J16)</content>

    <title>Monopsony and Employer Misoptimization Explain Why Wages Bunch at Round Numbers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that administrative hourly wage data exhibit considerable bunching at round numbers. We run two experiments randomizing wages around $0.10 and $1.00 to experimentally measure left-digit bias for identical tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk; we fail to find any evidence of discontinuity in the labor supply function at round numbers despite estimating a considerable degree of monopsony. We replicate these results in administrative worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon. We can rule out inattention estimates found in the behavioral product market literature. We provide evidence that firms “misoptimize” wage setting. More monopsony requires less employer misoptimization to explain bunching. (JEL D22, J22, J31, J42)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the employer's role in unemployment insurance (UI) take-up. Employer effects on claiming and appeals are substantial, and those effects are negatively correlated, consistent with appeals deterring claims. Low-wage workers are less likely to claim and more likely to have their claims appealed than median-wage workers. Employer effects help explain these income gradients, so equalizing employer effects on claiming would increase the progressivity of UI. Finally, the main source of targeting error in UI is that eligible workers do not claim. (JEL J22, J31, J63, J64, J65)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists routinely make functional form assumptions on demand curves to derive welfare conclusions. How sensitive are these conclusions to such assumptions? In this paper, we develop robustness measures that quantify the extent to which the true demand curve must deviate from common functional form assumptions in order to overturn a welfare conclusion. We parametrize this variability in terms of the gradient and curvature of the demand curve. By leveraging tools from information design, we show that our measures are easy to compute. Our measures are also flexible and easy to use, as we illustrate through empirical applications. (JEL D01, D60, F13, H55, Q48)</content>

    <title>Direct and Indirect Effects of Investment Tax Incentives</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the direct effects and indirect spillover effects of investment tax credits on firms. Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm's investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects. (JEL D22, H25, H32, J23, L25, L60, R11)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a randomized trial among 14,545 households in rural Burkina Faso to test the oft-cited hypothesis that limited access to contraception is an important driver of high fertility rates in West Africa. We do not find support for this hypothesis. Women who were given free access to modern contraception for three years did not have lower birth rates; we can reject even modest effects. We cross-randomized additional interventions to address inefficiencies that might depress demand for free contraception, specifically misperceptions about the child mortality rate and social norms. Free contraception did not significantly influence fertility even in combination with these interventions. (JEL D12, J13, J16, J18, O12)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Common values auction models, where bidder decisions depend on noisy signals of common values, provide predictions about Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes. In settings where these common values can be estimated, these predictions can be tested. We propose a series of tests, robust to assumptions about the signal structure, to determine whether the observed data could have been generated by a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In the setting of oil and gas lease auctions in New Mexico, we find evidence that participation decisions are correlated and that participants systematically underbid in light of ex post outcomes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study changes in political discourse during campaigns, using a novel dataset of candidate websites for US House elections, 2002–2016, and manifestos for French parliamentary and local elections, 1958–2022. We find that candidates move to the center in ideology and rhetorical complexity between the first round (or primary) and the second round (or general election). This convergence reflects candidates’ strategic adjustment to their opponents, as predicted by Downsian competition: Using an RDD we show that candidates converge to the platform of opponents who narrowly qualified for the last round as opposed to those who narrowly failed to qualify.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Accelerated investment in electricity transmission could reduce total costs and enhance renewable integration. I document static allocative inefficiencies induced by incomplete market integration in 2 major US markets; these have risen over time and totaled $2 billion in 2022. I also argue that estimating firm-level impacts is important, as incumbents may have the power to block new lines and other reforms. I show that 4 firms would have experienced a collective $1.3 billion drop in net revenues in 2022 had the market been integrated, and there are reports of some of these firms blocking transmission projects.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Galí (2014) showed that a monetary policy rule that raises rates when bubbles exceed some steady-state benchmark can paradoxically lead to larger deviations from steady state. Nevertheless, this comment shows that a central bank can always dampen a bubble by setting a higher-than-expected rate, although it may have to raise the rate aggressively. This is a different point from the Miao, Shen, and Wang (2019) comment on Galí (2014). They showed that when the central bank targets a different steady state than Galí considered, raising rates when bubbles exceed this alternative benchmark leads to smaller deviations from steady state.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a framework to extend the strategic form analysis of cursed equilibrium (CE) developed by Eyster and Rabin (2005) to multistage games. The approach uses behavioral strategies rather than normal form mixed strategies and imposes sequential rationality. We define and characterize properties of cursed sequential equilibrium (CSE) and apply it to four canonical economic applications: signaling games, reputation building, durable goods monopoly, and the dirty faces game. These applications illustrate various implications of CSE, show how and why it differs from sequential equilibrium and CE, and provide evidence from laboratory experiments that support the empirical relevance of CSE.

    <title>Decoupling Firm Growth From Carbon Emissions: A Supply Network Role Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To achieve meaningful progress in carbon neutrality, absolute carbon emissions must be reduced. One possible approach is to decouple firms' growth trajectories from their emissions. Adopting a supply network perspective, this study examines how firms in different network roles decouple their growth from carbon emissions across all scopes. Focusing on the aerospace and defense industry's supply network, we apply an ego‐temporal exponential random graph model (ego‐TERGM) to empirically infer four previously conceptualized firm roles—negotiator, orchestrator, executor, and compromiser—based on structural and nodal characteristics. The findings of our exploratory analysis reveal significant differences in decoupling performance: the firms in roles characterized by denser ego networks decouple more effectively, while those in roles characterized by central and monopolistic positions tend to perform worse. These differences reflect the influence of power dynamics and network dependencies on firms' decoupling abilities. Central firms must navigate complex demands, while those in denser network roles experience stronger normative pressures to conform to sustainable practices. Beyond these network effects, decoupling can be further supported by setting more ambitious emissions targets, adopting moderate growth strategies, and prioritizing environmental innovation.</content>

    <title>Developing Generative AI for Value Co‐Creation: An Intervention‐Based Randomized Field Experiment in a Healthcare Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Owing to limited healthcare resources, there has been increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) interventions to treat mental health problems of chronic disease patients in developing countries. However, it is challenging to overcome the AI trust crisis in the healthcare context and develop AI that improves the patient's personalized experience and the quality of care. Elaborating on the value co‐creation theory using an actor–network theory (ANT) approach, this study examines how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can improve post‐discharge care for patients with cardiovascular disease in resource‐limited settings. Using an intervention‐based research approach in collaboration with a major hospital in China, researchers co‐designed a GenAI intervention with potential users and various stakeholders. Through a randomized controlled trial, we further evaluated the impact of a co‐created GenAI intervention on the post‐discharge self‐confidence and quality of care of 114 patients. Compared with the standard post‐discharge care process, chronically ill patients who received the GenAI intervention experienced a 6.049‐point (out of a total of 80 points) decrease in state anxiety and an 87.8% decrease in the 30‐day readmission risk. The insights gained from the intervention process, as interpreted using the ANT approach, expand the generic framework of value co‐creation to include a more GenAI‐mediated network of human and non‐human objects. Results reveal GenAI's boundary‐spanning and integrating roles as a critical node in the emerging, dynamic, value‐creating actor network. The inclusion of “a nonparticipant observe” allows us to offer cognitive explanations for why GenAI works. Overall, this study contributes to healthcare operations management by designing a process for developing and implementing GenAI to improve healthcare operations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using property rights theory to examine the characteristics that enable family firms to exclude rivals from their competitive space, we explain why the family form of governance is often selected instead of the nonfamily form of governance and what determines the scale and scope of family firms. Family-centered nonpecuniary goals allow family firms to capture rights to common property opportunities that nonfamily firms find unattractive. Furthermore, the development and deployment of non-tradeable, immobile, inimitable, and indivisible human and nonhuman resources enable family firms to protect their property rights from competitors. Finally, because family members act as owners and managers, family firm governance can reduce the cost of monitoring as well as the possibility of opportunistic behavior and underinvestment of family resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the establishment of public audit oversight bodies (POBs) worldwide. We present descriptive evidence on POBs’ characteristics and factors influencing the timing of their establishment, finding that countries with stronger institutions, civil law traditions, and higher media attention to audit quality adopt POBs faster. While countries may choose similar POB design features, these choices do not align with the factors driving adoption speed. We also explore whether the finding of a positive impact on audit quality of the U.S. PCAOB generalizes to other countries. A difference‐in‐differences analysis over 20 years provides some evidence that POB establishment and their characteristics improve audit quality. However, the results appear sensitive to audit quality measures and research design. Our study offers the first broad‐based investigation of POB adoption and provides important nuance on the relation between POBs and audit quality.</content>

    <title>Roadblock on the Highway to Heaven? The Effect of Religion on Cluster Development in Controversial Industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial clusters are an important driver of economic growth, but regions with comparable resource profiles do not necessarily produce similar clusters. We propose that religion may play an important role in the spatial arrangement of industries and can explain why regions with similar resources do not produce similar clusters. We advance a theory predicting a suppressive effect of religion on the development of industrial clusters in morally controversial industries. We argue that in such industries, regions dominated by denominations that treat controversial industries as immoral will experience lower firm entry rates, compared to regions with a lower presence of such denominations. We theorize about three underlying processes. First, in regions dominated by religious groups opposing a controversial industry, negative attitudes of religious actors generate social environments unfavorable to businesses in this industry. Second, there could be an ecological effect of religion wherein the suppressive impact of a focal region’s oppositional religiosity is mitigated when neighboring regions have higher oppositional religiosity than that of the focal region. Finally, in regions with high oppositional religiosity, religious social movements are likely to emerge to target a controversial industry and its participants, which should further repel potential entrants. Our event-count analyses of biotherapeutics firm entry rates in U.S. metropolitan statistical areas from the industry’s beginning in 1976 through 2004 support our predictions.</content>

    <title>Insurance Versus Moral Hazard in Income-Contingent Student Loan Repayment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Student loans with income-contingent repayment insure borrowers against income risk but can reduce their incentives to earn more. Using a change in Australia’s income-contingent repayment schedule, I show that borrowers reduce their labor supply to lower their repayments. These responses are larger among borrowers with more hourly flexibility, a lower probability of repayment, and tighter liquidity constraints. I use these responses to estimate a dynamic model of labor supply with frictions that generate imperfect adjustment. My estimates imply that the labor supply responses to income-contingent repayment limit the optimal amount of insurance in government-provided student loans. However, these responses are too small to justify fixed repayment contracts: restructuring existing student loans from fixed repayment to a constrained-optimal income-contingent loan—while keeping the tax and transfer system unchanged—increases borrower welfare by the equivalent of a 0.8% increase in lifetime consumption at no additional fiscal cost.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a novel contextual bandit algorithm for personalized pricing under utility fairness constraints in scenarios with uncertain demand, achieving an optimal regret upper bound. Our approach, which incorporates dynamic pricing and demand learning, addresses the critical challenge of fairness in pricing strategies. We first delve into the static full-information setting to formulate an optimal pricing policy as a constrained optimization problem. Here, we propose an approximation algorithm for efficiently and approximately computing the ideal policy. We also use mathematical analysis and computational studies to characterize the structures of optimal contextual pricing policies subject to fairness constraints, deriving simplified policies that lay the foundations of more in-depth research and extensions. Further, we extend our study to dynamic pricing problems with demand learning, establishing a nonstandard regret lower bound that highlights the complexity added by fairness constraints. Our research offers a comprehensive analysis of the cost of fairness and its impact on the balance between utility and revenue maximization. This work represents a step toward integrating ethical considerations into algorithmic efficiency in data-driven dynamic pricing.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Effects of the 2021 Expanded Child Tax Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the impact of the 2021 Child Tax Credit (CTC) expansion using detailed transaction data from nearly two million individuals and difference-in-difference analyses around monthly CTC payments. We find that recipients significantly increase their consumption in the week following the payment versus the prior week, with more pronounced effects for lower-income recipients and those with more children. We also find a significant reduction in liquidity constraints for lower-income recipients, with reductions in overdrafts, use of high-interest payday loans, and use of gig work for supplemental income. Building on these initial findings, our analysis further delves into more nuanced, policy-targeted aspects: We observe a greater alleviation of liquidity constraints from monthly CTC payments compared with annual tax refunds. In addition, monthly payments decrease consumption volatility and increase stability in consumption levels. These results inform considerations for payment frequency. Furthermore, we provide insights into the income thresholds for the policy’s phase-in and phase-out ranges by identifying the most pronounced consumption effects among the lowest-income recipients—who benefit from full refundability under the plan—and noting an absence of significant consumption changes among higher-income recipients. Our results present the first large-scale, transaction-based, empirical archival evidence of the effects stemming from the 2021 CTC amendments and provide insights for policy-related discussions.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: We acknowledge funding from the Think Forward Initiative and the University of California, Irvine, and the U See I Write initiative at the University of California, Irvine, for focused writing retreats which facilitated the writing of this manuscript.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02254 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use arbitrage activity in equity, fixed income, and foreign exchange markets to characterize the frictions and constraints facing intermediaries. The average pairwise correlation between the 32 arbitrage spreads that we study is 22%. These low correlations are inconsistent with canonical intermediary asset pricing models. We show that at least two types of segmentation drive arbitrage dynamics. First, funding is segmented—certain trades rely on specific funding sources, making their arbitrage spreads sensitive to localized funding shocks. Second, balance sheets are segmented—intermediaries specialize in certain trades, so arbitrage spreads are sensitive to idiosyncratic balance‐sheet shocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sell‐side analysts commonly transition to buy‐side money managers. I examine whether and how these career transitions shape sell‐side analysts' behavior, relying on the granular career information of 6,310 analysts in the United States. I identify analysts who transition from the sell‐side to the buy‐side and find that these analysts issue inflated recommendations on stocks of interest to their future buy‐side employers. This favoritism is (1) present only during the year preceding their transition, (2) more pronounced among stocks where a single analyst is more influential in moving the stock price; and (3) present only among transitions likely to be strategically planned. Importantly, stocks receiving inflated recommendations experience a significant price decline following the departure of transitioning analysts from the sell‐side. Overall, these findings suggest that analyst career transitions are an important source of conflicts of interest.</content>

    <title>Stick together or break apart? Stigmatizing adverse events, media vilification, and unplanned alliance dissolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article advances the understanding of alliance instability by integrating organizational stigma and signaling theories to explain unplanned alliance dissolution after potentially stigmatizing adverse events. We highlight the media as a key intermediary influencing whether partners stick together or break apart. We also argue that firm status and external corporate governance serve as signals that key stakeholders interpret differently, that is, amplifying media vilification but mitigating the event's impact on partners' decision to dissolve the alliance. Using a sample of US passenger airlines from 1985 to 2016, our findings support the view that it takes more than a stigmatizing event to disrupt an alliance. By establishing boundaries for stigmatization effects and contextualizing firm‐specific signals, we offer a nuanced explanation of the mechanisms driving alliance instability.Managerial SummaryFirms inevitably face adverse events, from uncontrollable accidents to errors, resulting in severe consequences such as diminished valuation and damaged reputation. In such situations, executives of the firm affected by an adverse event must decide whether to rely on their alliance partners to stick with their firm or prepare for the eventuality that partners will run away. To address this question, we conducted a 31‐year study of 40 publicly traded US airline companies. Our findings underscore the impact of negative media coverage on unplanned alliance dissolution, surpassing the influence of event characteristics; they draw the attention of affected firms’ executives to the dual implications of their firms’ status and external corporate governance – a double‐edged sword that requires careful consideration.</content>

    <title>Self‐regulation, corruption, and competitiveness in extractive industries: Making transparency pay</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self‐regulation is often proposed as a substitute for government regulation. We examine a setting in which a subset of firms voluntarily committed to transparency standards despite immediate competitive disadvantages, not merely to preempt regulation but to succeed under future mandatory rules they helped enact through lobbying. Focusing on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an anti‐corruption multi‐stakeholder initiative, we show that firms initially incurred competitive costs in corrupt markets after endorsing EITI. These firms subsequently lobbied for mandatory disclosure regulations. Once mandatory rules took effect, previously disadvantaged transparent firms gained substantial competitive advantages. Our study highlights how firms can integrate voluntary commitment with political advocacy to resolve collective action problems, reshaping both competitive dynamics and the regulatory landscape.Managerial SummaryFirms frequently sign onto voluntary pro‐social or pro‐environmental initiatives to placate activists, avoid tougher regulation, or burnish reputations. We examine global oil and mining companies that backed the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), even though transparency commitments initially hurt their ability to win licenses in highly corrupt countries. Rather than stopping at voluntary disclosure, these firms aggressively campaigned for mandatory payment‐reporting laws that would level the competitive playing field. When governments eventually imposed those rules, early EITI supporters gained significant, sustained advantages. The study shows that combining voluntary transparency with targeted political advocacy lets companies steer regulation, convert short‐term costs into long‐term strategic gains, and address corruption.</content>

    <title>When mimicry leads to divergence: Interdependence asymmetries and selective imitation among competitors</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate why firms imitating the same competitor's strategy in the same environment often replicate different components of that strategy. We argue that such divergence can arise because firms vary in the internal interdependencies that underlie their strategies. When a firm significantly differs from a competitor in how one component of its strategy interacts with other components, the consequences of replicating the competitor's choices about that component are harder to anticipate, making imitation less likely. We discuss how imitators' internal coordination mechanisms may help mitigate barriers to imitation arising from interdependence asymmetries and test our resulting hypotheses in the context of esports, where small teams of professional video‐game players compete in high‐stakes tournaments.Managerial SummaryWe investigate why firms observing the same competitor often imitate different aspects of that competitor’s strategy. We argue that this variation stems from each firm’s unique internal connections between activities. When a competitor’s practice is closely linked to other parts of their strategy, imitation becomes riskier if similar links do not exist in the focal firm—making imitation less likely. Using data from esports teams, where both strategic choices and coordination are observable, we show that these differences can act as barriers to imitation. However, strong communication or shared experience among decision‐makers helps overcome such barriers. Our results may caution managers against indiscriminately copying “best practices”: the highly competitive teams we studied considered not only what competitors did, but also whether those practices fit their own processes and structures.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Assortment Optimization in the Presence of Focal Effect: Operational Insights and Efficient Algorithms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The assortment provided by the seller can influence customers’ evaluation of item utility. A possible consequence is that certain items in an assortment become “focal items” to customers, and customers over-evaluate their utilities. We refer to this phenomenon as thefocal effect. Kovach and Tserenjigmid (2022) recently propose a focal Luce model (FLM) to describe customers’ choices in the presence of the focal effect. The merit of the FLM lies in its flexibility to model different consumer psychology, which leads to varying choice behaviors. In this paper, we use the FLM to capture several scenarios where the focal effect occurs and consider the associated assortment optimization problems. In the first scenario, the focal effect arises from item ranking, and customers prefer items that appear at certain positions in the ranking. This scenario captures the case where customers have a preference for the cheapest items in the assortment, as well as the compromise effect. The second scenario describes the case where the focal effect exists on some predetermined items. An example of this scenario is choice overload, where customers are more likely to choose the no-purchase option when the assortment size is larger. We characterize the optimal assortment structure under each scenario and give the underlying operational insights. We find that the assortment optimization problems under these two scenarios can be solved in polynomial time with some practical assumptions. The polynomial-solvability extends even to the more challenging joint assortment and pricing optimization problems. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the FLM’s performance using both synthetic and real datasets. The results show that the FLM performs well in predicting customer choice behavior and the corresponding optimal assortment generates higher profit than benchmark assortments when the focal effect exists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Maximizing customer retention in multi-session training service: Model and algorithm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Training is an important business in the service sector. Usually, a training program involves multiple sessions and each session contains multiple activities. Although it is essential for customers to participate in all training sessions and activities, many customers fail to complete the program because the training experience is too stressful. Given the importance of customer retention in the training programs, we investigate the modeling and optimization of the retention-oriented training program design problem (RTDP), which maximizes overall service retention across all training sessions through activity scheduling. Customers make their participation decisions about their next training session based on the remembered holistic utility of past training activities. By our analysis, RTDP is a 0-1 constrained exponential sum problem (0-1 CESP), which we prove to be NP-hard. To resolve RTDP, we introduce a geometric branch and bound (GB&amp;B) algorithm that efficiently searches for the optimal solution by resolving a series of subproblems. From a numerical study, we find that higher reward, difficulty, and value lead to more U-shaped, inverted U-shaped, and increasing subsequences in each session, respectively. The reason is that higher reward favors sequences with a pleasant start and a sharp positive gradient toward the end, higher difficulty requires warm-up and cool-down, and higher value makes customers emphasize the end experience. Finally, we extend our research by investigating RTDP with session breaks and discussing the joint retention-performance optimization. When there are breaks between sessions, we find that as the break duration increases, the optimal value first increases and then decreases. For the joint retention-performance optimization, the optimal sequence is more pulsed if the service designer cares more about customer performance and flatter if the service designer cares more about customer retention.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dyadic Interactions and Patient Service Evaluation in Online Healthcare Consultations: The Role of Communication Alignment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of doctor–patient interactions on patients’ service evaluations in online medical consultations (OMCs) has received considerable attention. However, prior research has mainly focused on the individual-level and statistical features of these interactions, with limited exploration of dyad-level dynamics in doctor–patient bidirectional communication. To address this gap, this study examines both individual-level and dyad-level features of online doctor–patient interactions to understand their effects on patients’ service evaluations. We characterize doctors’ individual-level communication behaviors using the quantity and informativeness of doctors’ information acquisition and provision, and capture dyad-level features by quantifying communication alignment in doctor–patient dialogues using spectral analysis. We utilize patient gratitude as an indicator of patients’ service evaluation. Drawing on expectancy violations theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the direct and interaction effects of doctors’ communication behaviors and doctor–patient communication alignment on patient gratitude in OMCs. The model is empirically tested using a large dataset collected from a leading OMC platform in China. The analysis reveals three key findings. First, the informativeness of doctors’ information acquisition negatively affects patient gratitude, while neither the informativeness nor the quantity of information provision has a significant effect. Second, communication alignment positively influences patient gratitude. Third, communication alignment positively moderates the effects of the informativeness of both information acquisition and provision on patient gratitude. This study contributes to the literature on patients’ service evaluations, doctor–patient interactions, and communication alignment in online healthcare, and offers practical guidelines for enhancing the overall quality of online healthcare services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine traders’ order submission strategies during the Euronext preopen, which uses price-time priorities to arrange opening trades via a call auction. Preopening order submissions follow a J-shape pattern. Sophisticated proprietary traders arrive late, consistent with information leakage concerns. Slow clients arrive early and place aggressive orders to advertise their trading needs and strategically gain time priority. Their early order submissions often occur in stocks with an increase in the tick size and on days with expected liquidity shocks. They also contribute to daily price discovery. Using a preopening outage as a natural experiment, we show that the Euronext preopen improves price discovery on a rival venue. These benefits hold even in the absence of an opening auction taking place.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: Financial support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grants ANR-16-CE26-0008, ANR-17-EURE-0010 (Investissements d’Avenir program)].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03998 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the role of insurers in providing liquidity in the corporate bond market, especially during “rainy days” when the aggregate dealer inventory is positive for a relatively large fraction of the outstanding bonds. We find that, on average, life insurers have positive liquidity supply in the years following the 2007–2009 financial crisis, primarily driven by their buy-side transactions. Insurers’ corporate bond purchases improve the liquidity of transacted bonds and comparable bonds on rainy days. Using unusual weather-related losses realized in the affiliated property and casualty division as an instrumental variable, we show that corporate bonds purchased more by insurers have higher liquidity in subsequent periods.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02994 .</content>

    <title>Blinded versus Unblinded Review: A Field Study on the Equity of Peer-Review Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to inequities in merit-based evaluations. We tested this claim in a high-stakes field experiment comparing single-blind review (reviewer identities withheld) and double-blind review (reviewer and author identities withheld) for 530 academic conference submissions. On reliability, both processes showed moderate reliability, leading to only 40% overlap among top-rated submissions. This low overlap indicates that differences between review systems partly stem from noise in the review system. In terms of fairness, our analysis indicates that single-blind reviews favored more senior coauthors and first authors who were PhD students or research scientists while disfavoring Asian (versus White) first authors. Meanwhile, male first authors received slightly higher ratings in both conditions (especially under double-blind), but the greater the proportion of male coauthors, the lower the review ratings were under double-blind (versus single-blind). On validity, we find that for submissions accepted and presented as a talk, neither review ratings nor author characteristics predicted talk quality, number of questions, or attendance. However, review ratings from both systems similarly predicted judged poster presentation quality (for a subset of submissions) and eventual publication (for all submissions). These findings highlight limitations in both single- and double-blind approaches. Double-blind review is not a cure-all for inequities that might arise via single-blind. Yet, including author identities does not appear to enhance reliability or validity enough to justify the risks this information poses in potentially advantaging a particular individual or group.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and data analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SBE 1824259].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01646 .</content>

    <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for Human-Guided Human-Machine Interaction with Private Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the human-machine interaction such as recommending videos for improving customer engagement, we study human-guided human-machine interaction for decision making with private information. We model this interaction as a two-player turn-based game, where one player (Bob, a human) guides the other player (Alice, a machine) toward a common goal. Specifically, we focus on offline reinforcement learning (RL) in this game, where the goal is to find a policy pair for Alice and Bob that maximizes their expected total rewards based on an offline data set collected a priori. The offline setting presents two challenges: (i) We cannot collect Bob’s private information, leading to a confounding bias when using standard RL methods, and (ii) there is a distributional mismatch between the behavior policy used to collect data and the desired optimal policy we aim to learn. To tackle the confounding bias, we treat Bob’s previous action as an instrumental variable for Alice’s current decision making to adjust for the unmeasured confounding. We establish a novel identification result and propose a new off-policy evaluation (OPE) method for evaluating policy pairs in this two-player turn-based game. To tackle the distributional mismatch, we leverage the idea of pessimism and use our OPE method to develop an off-policy policy learning algorithm for finding a desirable policy pair for both Alice and Bob. Moreover, we prove that under some technical assumptions, the policy pair obtained through our method converges to the optimal one at a satisfactory rate. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: L.

    <title>Income Pools for Superstar Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Superstar” markets, where a small portion of individuals earn disproportionately high incomes, are common in fields like entrepreneurship, sports, and entertainment. Participants in these markets face significant income uncertainty, which can deter entry or prompt early exit. To address this difficulty, we propose income pools: contracts where individuals agree to share a portion of future earnings with pool members if a specific salary milestone is achieved. To date, hundreds of income pool contracts have been signed in practice. This paper develops the first mathematical model to analyze such contracts, focusing on stability (i.e., pools where no agents leave or join). When constrained to creating a single pool, we show that a stable pool always exists with specific structural properties. Generally, stronger agents tend to be more “collaborative” and favor larger pools, whereas weaker agents are more “selfish” and prefer smaller pools. Next, we analyze pools that adhere to a maximum size (mirroring current practice) and show that stability persists. These pools typically require more weaker agents than strong ones and we find an interesting “Pareto dominance” result, whereby all agents in a stable pool prefer a particular unique stable pool. Finally, we study general partition structures, prove that a stable partition always exists under certain conditions, and provide an algorithm to construct such a partition. We conclude with a case study on data from 2,000 professional baseball players to demonstrate a 20%–30% increase in social welfare if players join income pools, under varying contract parameters.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: T.

    <title>The Benefits of Delay to Online Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Real-time decisions are usually irrevocable in many contexts of online decision making. One common practice is delaying real-time decisions so that the decision maker can gather more information to make better decisions. For example, in online retailing, there is typically a time delay between when an online order is received and when it gets picked and assembled for shipping. However, decisions cannot be delayed forever. In this paper, we study this fundamental trade-off and aim to theoretically characterize the benefits of delaying real-time decisions. We provide a theoretical foundation for a broad family of online decision-making problems by proving that the gap between our proposed online algorithm (called “delayed Bayesian prophet”) and the offline optimal hindsight policy decays exponentially fast in the length of delay. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments on the benefits of delay, using both synthetic data and publicly available real data. Both our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate an important managerial insight: a little delay is all we need. Finally, we extend our analysis and results to the setting where the arrival distribution is independent but nonidentical, the setting where the arrival distribution is unknown, and the setting where decisions are made in batches.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The second author was partially funded by a grant from Amazon.com Inc., awarded through collaboration with the Columbia Center of AI Technology.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00549 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The positive role of transformational leadership for productivity and mental well-being has long been established. Transformational leadership behavior may be particularly suited to navigate times of crisis that are characterized by high levels of complexity and uncertainty. We exploit quasi-random assignment of employees to managers and study the role of frontline managers’ leadership styles on employees’ performance, work style, and mental well-being in times of crisis. Using longitudinal administrative data and panel survey data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that the benefits of different leadership styles depend on the environment: Employees of more transactional managers outperform those of more transformational leaders before the onset of the pandemic. During the pandemic, however, more transformational managers lead employees to better performance and mental well-being. We discuss potential explanations and implications.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, BDE.Funding: K. Czura and F.

    <title>Do Option Characteristics Predict the Underlying Stock Returns in the Cross-Section?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of option-implied information for predicting the cross-section of stock returns. Based on large sets of firm and option characteristics and using traditional portfolio sorts and modern high-dimensional methods, we find that option information matters. However, in contrast to existing studies, there are only a few option characteristics that have significant incremental predictive power after controlling for the large set of firm characteristics. Further analysis reveals that the strongest option characteristics are associated with asset mispricing, future tail return realizations, and short-selling costs. Our findings are consistent with models of informed trading and limits to arbitrage.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: R. T.

    <title>The Effect of a System for Sharing Best Practices Within Pre-Existing Peer Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer networks, such as enterprise social networks (ESNs), can facilitate knowledge transfer across employees. However, such systems can also lead to information overload or difficulty in finding useful information. We examine data from a natural field experiment where a retailer introduced a system for sharing best practices (SSBP) in an existing online peer network, a control mechanism that enables easy access to well-organized best practices from high-performing units. The SSBP did not have a significant immediate or average effect on sales, however it significantly increased the sales trends of the stores where it was implemented. Sales improvement was greatest in stores that (a) perceived higher information overload from the online peer network before the intervention, or (b) had lower exposure to offline peers. The SSBP led to an increase, rather than decrease, of voluntary interstore knowledge sharing in the online peer network. These findings shed light on how a formal mechanism for sharing best practices can enhance the decision-facilitating role of relevant information without discouraging spontaneous knowledge sharing within the existing peer networks.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00990 .</content>

    <title>Guaranteed Demand and Corporate R&amp;amp;D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. government incentivizes firms to develop innovative technologies by awarding research and development (R&amp;D) contracts that often carry an implicit promise of “guaranteed demand.” Firms that demonstrate strong technological capabilities are rewarded with noncompetitive production contracts for the resulting products and services. Using newly assembled data on $4.2 trillion in government procurement contracts from all federal agencies, matched to U.S. publicly traded firms, we document a “crowding-in” effect, where government R&amp;D contracts lead to increased investment in corporate scientific research. This effect is concentrated in large, vertically integrated firms and limited to upstream R&amp;D. We argue that these patterns are best explained by a guaranteed demand mechanism: Firms co-invest in upstream research when success offers a credible path to future noncompetitive production contracts. We develop a theoretical framework to explain when it is optimal for the government to bundle R&amp;D and production contracts. Our analysis shows that guaranteed demand can produce higher quality at a lower total cost for upstream R&amp;D projects when the R&amp;D firms have production capabilities. Our empirical results support these predictions. Additionally, we find that the crowding-in effect has weakened over time as the government has increasingly decoupled R&amp;D contracts from production contracts. We discuss the potential implications of this decoupling.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: Financial support from the Alfred P.

    <title>Improving Transparency and Verifiability in School Admissions: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Students participating in centralized admissions procedures do not typically have access to the information used to determine their matched school, such as other students’ preferences or school priorities. This can lead to doubts about whether their matches were computed correctly (the “verifiability problem”) or, at a deeper level, whether the promised admissions procedure was even used (the “transparency problem”). In a model that spans many popular applications, we show how these problems can be addressed by providing appropriate feedback to students without disclosing sensitive information like other students’ preferences or school priorities. In particular, we show that the verifiability problem can be solved by (1) publicly communicating “cutoffs” (the minimum scores required to be eligible for each school) or (2) using “single-school” preference elicitation procedures that convey rich “experiential” information. In our main result, we show that the transparency problem can be solved by using cutoffs and single-school elicitation procedures together. We find strong support for these solutions in a laboratory experiment and show how they can be implemented for popular school admissions applications involving top trading cycles, and deferred and immediate acceptance.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [Project 100018_207722].

    <title>A social influence view of the internationalization of cultural products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A thriving international cultural industry fuels the expansion of the global creative economy. Yet, what drives the international diffusion and performance of cultural products? This study adopts a social influence perspective to examine the international performance of film exports, addressing a critical gap in existing research that often isolates social influences without considering the impact of their (in)congruence. Given the subjective nature of cultural products and their vulnerability to multiple influences across global value chains, we theorize and empirically test the effects of congruence and incongruence between supply-side and demand-side social influences on films’ international performance. Analyzing 1676 U.S. films released between 2009 and 2018, our findings reveal that congruence between supply-side and demand-side social influences significantly enhances a film’s appeal, credibility, and international success. Moreover, this effect is amplified by two key moderators across global value chains, namely, upstream home-country adoption of social media promotion and downstream host-country press freedom. This study contributes to the understanding of the social influence view within global value chains by highlighting the importance of supply-demand congruence and the contextual factors that shape their effectiveness in driving the international performance of cultural products.</content>

    <title>Digital Bricolage and Its Limits: How Microenterprises Undertake Digitalization in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Small enterprises are under pressure to change and digitalize. Many have had to reimagine how they use digital technology to do business. Our research suggests that for microenterprises, digitalization can be an organic form of development, driven by making do with the digital resources at hand rather than a deliberate strategy that prioritizes investment in complex digital technology. Harnessing the potential of this could accelerate the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal to increase access to value chains and markets for small enterprises in developing countries. Our findings offer evidence for policymakers to rethink conventional strategies and develop more context-sensitive support mechanisms that reflect how digitalization actually unfolds in resource-limited settings. For information systems and management education research, the empirical study theorizes digitalization from an alternative perspective that is less emphasized in current literature. It considers the reality of many resource-limited business ventures around the world and their need to “make do.” This contrasts with the prevailing emphasis on cutting-edge technology in existing literature and case studies. By spotlighting the emergent, adaptive, and often improvised nature of small enterprise digitalization, this work invites a rethinking of how we teach, study, and support digital innovation in diverse global contexts.</content>
