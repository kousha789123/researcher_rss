    <title>Nonbank Lending and the Transmission of Monetary Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the role of nonbank lenders in the transmission of monetary policy using data on the universe of unsecured credit to firms and households in Denmark. Nonbanks increase their credit supply after a monetary contraction, both relative to banks and in absolute terms. The increase in nonbank lending is financed through increased long-term debt. A model with segmented debt markets featuring differential investor rate sensitivities rationalizes these findings. Nonbank credit insulates corporate investment and household consumption from monetary contractions, with positive spillovers extending beyond nonbank clients through industry and geographic channels.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of insurance companies in supporting resiliency in the corporate bond market. We show that during the COVID-19 liquidity crisis, insurers increased their corporate bond positions, particularly in bonds facing fire sales by mutual funds. Insurers with more stable funding were more likely to buy, and they bought more from dealers with whom they had prior trading relationships. Dealers improved their bond liquidity provision when they had trading relationships with insurers with more stable funding. Our work demonstrates that insurers can play an important role in supporting bond market resiliency during times of stress. (JEL: G10, G12, G20, G22, G23, G24)</content>

    <title>Taxes Depress Corporate Borrowing: Evidence from Private Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use variation in state corporate income tax rates to re-examine the relation between taxes and corporate leverage. Contrary to prior research, corporate leverage rises after tax cuts for small private firms. An estimated dynamic equilibrium model shows that tax cuts make capital more productive and spur the use of leverage. Tax cuts also produce more distant default thresholds and lower credit spreads. These effects outweigh the lower interest tax deduction and lead to higher optimal leverage choices, especially for firms with flexible investment policies. The presence of the interest tax deduction raises consumer welfare in equilibrium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Novel Fully Online Matching Algorithm in Stochastic EnvironmentsIn many modern applications, such as ride-sharing, participants arrive and depart dynamically, requiring quick decisions about who to match and when. In “Fully Online Matching with General Stochastic Arrivals and Departures,” Li, Wang, and Yan introduce a fully online matching framework that models these real-world dynamics. Each arrival follows a known identical and independent distribution over agent types, whereas the sojourn time is unknown in advance and follows type-specific distributions with known expectations. To address this, they propose a linear programming–based algorithm that guarantees a competitive ratio of at least 0.192 under mild conditions—more than 50% better than the state-of-the-art result of 0.125. They also establish several hardness results to highlight the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. Numerical experiments further confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of their algorithm, offering new insights for decision making in stochastic and dynamic environments.</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Resource Pooling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Resource pooling improves system efficiency drastically in large stochastic systems, but its effective implementation in decentralized systems remains relatively underexplored. This paper studies how to incentivize resource pooling when agents are self-interested, and their states are private information. Our primary motivation is applications in the design of decentralized computing markets, among others. We study a standard multiserver queueing model in which each server is associated with an [Formula: see text] queue and aims to minimize its time-average job holding and processing costs. We design a simple token-based mechanism where servers can earn tokens by offering help and spend tokens to request help from other servers, all in their self-interest. The mechanism induces a complex game among servers. We employ the fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) concept to analyze the system, combining mean-field approximation with fluid relaxation. This framework enables us to derive a closed-form characterization of servers’ FMFE strategies. We show that these FMFE strategies approximate well the servers’ rational behavior. We leverage this framework to optimize the design of the mechanism and present our main results: As the number of servers increases, the proposed mechanism incentivizes complete resource pooling—that is, the system dynamics and performance under our mechanism match those under centralized control. Finally, we show that our mechanism achieves the first-best performance even when helping others incurs higher job processing costs and remains nearly optimal in settings with heterogeneous servers.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model social media as collections of users producing and consuming content. Users value consuming content, but due to scarce attention, they may not value all content from other users. Users also value receiving attention, creating the incentive to attract an audience by producing valuable content but also through attention bartering—users mutually becoming each other’s audience. Attention bartering shapes substantially the patterns of production and consumption on social media, explains key features of social media behavior and platform decision making, and yields sharp predictions that are consistent with data we collect from #EconTwitter. We conduct Twitter and Instagram user surveys that yield additional direct evidence in support of attention bartering, and we discuss the implications of attention bartering for the design of social media platforms.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00060 .</content>

    <title>The Treasury Collateral Spread and Levered Safe-Asset Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks are vital suppliers of money-like safe assets, which they produce by issuing short-term liabilities and pledging collateral. But their ability to create safe assets varies over time as leverage constraints fluctuate. I write a simple model to describe private safe-asset production when intermediaries face leverage constraints. I directly measure leverage constraints using confidential supervisory data on high-frequency changes in the largest banks’ repurchase agreements (repos). The collateral spread—the maturity-matched yield spread between Treasuries used as repo collateral more often and Treasuries used less often—compensates for bank leverage risk and averages about 0.5 basis points, a sizable magnitude roughly equal to 60% of the five-year Treasury cheapest-to-deliver basis.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06104 .</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Precision and Human Decision: A Study of Interactive Optimization for School Schedules</title>
    <updated>2025-11-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In collaboration with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), this paper introduces an interactive optimization framework to tackle complex school scheduling challenges. The choice of school start and end times is an optimization challenge, as schedules influence the district’s transportation system, and limiting the associated costs is a computationally difficult combinatorial problem. However, it is also a policy challenge, as transportation costs are far from the only consequence of school schedule changes. Policymakers need time and knowledge to balance these considerations and reach a consensus carefully; past implementations have failed because of policy issues, despite state-of-the-art optimization approaches. We first motivate our approach with a microfoundation model of the interplay between policymakers and researchers, arguing that limiting their dependency is key. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that includes (1) a fast algorithm capable of solving the school schedule problem that compares favorably to the literature and (2) an interactive optimization approach that leverages this speed to allow policymakers to explore a variety of solutions in a transparent and efficient way, facilitating the policy decision-making process. The framework led to the first optimization-driven school start time changes in the United States, updating the schedule of all 133 schools in SFUSD in 2021, with annual transportation savings exceeding $5 million. A comprehensive survey of approximately 27,000 parents and staff in 2022 provides evidence of the approach’s effectiveness.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05834 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study ethnic investing, using transaction data from Kenya’s stock exchange and CEO/board turnover. We show that a given investor invests more in a given firm when the firm is run by coethnics and earns lower risk-adjusted returns on such investments. We then model and empirically test for the aggregate impact of (i) the implied taste- or psychology-driven investor discrimination and (ii) counteracting demand- and supply-side forces. Our estimates imply that listed Kenyan firms could collectively be worth 38% more—with minority-run firms benefitting the most—if the neutral proportion of active investors increased from 4.6% to 50%.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03660 .</content>

    <title>Heterogeneous Oil Supply Elasticities: Indebtedness and Production Responses to the COVID-19 Shock</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Debt matters for oil supply elasticities. We document the resiliency of oil production to the COVID-19-related collapse in demand due to indebtedness. We use exogenous variation in the timing of debt-related payments to identify financially constrained operators. We show that more financially constrained firms cut production by less than less-constrained firms and were less likely to complete new wells. To explore the mechanisms, we use borrowing-limit cuts and credit-line drawdowns to measure access to credit, and we exploit failed hedging practices. The propagation of oil demand shocks crucially depends on the indebtedness of the oil sector. (JEL G32, D22, Q41)</content>

    <title>Diversification, Market Entry, and the Global Internet Backbone</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many industries, buyers diversify their supplier base to manage supplier disruption risk. We investigate the importance of such diversification as a determinant of demand and supplier entry in the context of the internet backbone, the worldwide network of undersea fibre-optic cables that underpins the internet. We specify a model of international bandwidth demand and cable operators’ dynamic entry and supply choices. The model is estimated using novel data on cross-border data flows, prices, cable characteristics, and disruptions. Counterfactual analysis reveals that supplier diversification accounts for a large share of entry and surplus created between 2005 and 2021. Relative to the socially optimal level of entry, distortions due to suppliers’ inability to capture fully the social benefits of diversity are as large as distortions due to business stealing.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Capacity Configuration and Allocation under Capacity Risk: Trade-Offs between Fill Rates and Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capacity configuration and allocation problems in production networks under demand uncertainty have been extensively studied in the literature. In addition to demand uncertainty, capacity risk is also prevalent in practice. This paper considers a bipartite production system consisting of multiple plants and a set of customers located in different areas. In particular, these plants will use their configured capacities, facing capacity risk, to serve those customers who have differentiated fill-rate requirements with uncertain demands. Our objective is to optimize capacity configuration and allocation decisions by formulating the problem as a two-stage stochastic program that explicitly incorporates capacity risks and budget constraints. First, we develop a novel “randomized edge-weighted max-flow” priority rule that integrates capacity risk, penalty costs of unmet demands, and allocation costs to allocate the realized capacities to satisfy fill-rate targets, with a tunable parameter introduced to balance service levels and costs. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying plants with zero capacities and obtain some practical insights, which can help reduce the potential redundancy of the network system. When partial information and correlation of distributions are known, we implement robust optimization techniques to obtain the ranges of robust capacities under various scenarios. Some practical managerial implications are derived by theoretically discussing the impacts of capacity risk and demand correlations on these ranges. From numerical experiments, we found that the long-chain configuration no longer has the “almost-as-goodas-the-fully-flexible-network” advantage when the capacities are random. In addition, we also investigate the impacts of correlations among realized capacities or demands on the associated flexibility. Finally, some interesting and useful insights for practitioners can be obtained by analyzing the impacts of costs, fill rates, and uncertainty on the total optimal capacity and total configuration cost.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing under Consumer Habituation: The Optimality of a Familiarity-Based Threshold Policy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical evidence indicates that consumers experience a relative loss of excitement over time and miss their habits when refraining from consumption under repeated purchases. Despite the practices of first-time trials and welcome-back offers, how to exploit this habituation behavior through customized dynamic pricing is overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we analyze the long-run optimal customized dynamic pricing strategy in the presence of consumer habituation for time/frequency-based consumption. The consumer’s willingness to pay is determined by past consumption via the habitual level of consumption. We formulate the seller’s continuous-time profit maximization problem over an infinite horizon as an optimal control problem and derive the closed-form value function and optimal pricing strategy. We identify a key condition on the willingness-to-pay function that captures both the magnitude of the habituation effect and the saturated willingness to pay, which plays a central role in determining the seller’s optimal pricing policy. When consumers retain interest even at high levels of habitual consumption, alwayssellingby pricing at their current willingness to pay is optimal. In contrast, if consumers lose interest when saturated, the optimal policy becomes a cutoff strategy, where the seller offers the product only when consumption remains below a critical threshold and prices out consumers beyond it.We further examine the resulting pricing and consumption dynamics and characterize an equilibrium habitual level of consumption at which randomized promotions can be optimal. Furthermore, our key findings qualitatively hold under random consumer valuation, but with richer patterns. Our work provides a tractable, closed-form characterization of the optimal dynamic pricing policy under consumer habituation, offering a more nuanced understanding of the strategic implications of an inverted U-shaped willingness-to-pay.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To increase their competitiveness, firms continue to upgrade their products and to buy technology upgrade components. While firms generally know the value of technology upgrade products (components), they do not know when the upgrade solution can be produced on a massive scale, who can produce it, and what the unit production cost is when they make their purchase decisions. To obtain the upgrade solution information and to reduce their purchase costs, some firms adopt thestrategic supplier with bargainingmechanism, while other firms adopt thereverse auction with incentivemechanism. Recently, some firms (e.g., China National Petroleum Corporation) have adopted an innovative mechanism: they establish strategic partnerships with advanced suppliers and promise a proportion of the order to incentivise them to reveal the information on time. Meanwhile, they also adopt the reverse auction to determine the winning supplier and the purchase price for the remaining order to reduce purchase costs. Motivated by these firms’ practices, we propose a new procurement mechanism for technology upgrade products:the strategic auction mechanism. We analyse the optimal promised proportion of the order, the suppliers’ equilibrium policy, and the buyer’s equilibrium profit under this mechanism. In addition, we compare the performance of these three mechanisms and identify their application conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Algorithms for Online Metric Matching with Stochastic Arrivals or PredictionsHow do we match riders to drivers? Online metric matching offers a clean abstraction of this problem, where arriving riders are instantaneously matched to waiting drivers and the matching cost is measured by the pickup distance. Its challenge lies in making matching decisions without knowing the locations of future riders, for which the simple greedy approach yields suboptimal solutions. In their paper “Online Metric Matching: Beyond the Worst Case,” Yang and Yu propose a novel algorithmic framework of designing algorithms for online metric matching when given access to additional information of riders’ locations in advance. They then apply this framework to derive new algorithms when the riders’ locations are independently sampled or when an untrusted prediction of riders’ locations is provided. In the former model, their algorithms achieve improved competitive ratio and regret guarantees for various settings. In the latter model, they present an algorithm whose performance smoothly depends on the prediction error while preserving the worst-case guarantee.</content>

    <title>Collaborative Learning and Decision Making on Pricing and Recommendation: A Simple Framework for Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formulate a collaborative learning and decision-making problem involving contextual information. In current business practices, pricing and recommendation decisions often are made jointly by multiple teams in sequence. The decision-making processes for different teams can be controlled by either a centralized or decentralized planner. We propose a simple collaboration framework that integrates the learning about decision making in an unknown environment. The main challenge in a decentralized framework is that the decision-making process in other teams is unknown, but the subsequent decisions are mutually dependent. From a practical concern about high exploration costs and implementation complexity, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for centralized planners and a “greedy” + “weighted sampling” (GWS) algorithm for both centralized and decentralized planners to balance the learning and earning. We show that the exploration-free greedy algorithm can achieve the optimal rate when context diversity holds. The GWS algorithm works effectively for either centralized or decentralized planners under a much weaker condition, which we call context variation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the multiproduct pricing and ranking problem and study the model misspecification issue. We validate our results using simulations on synthetic and real data.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine environmental, social, and governance (ESG) misreporting in the context of the UK government requirement to report gender employment ratios and pay gaps. Highlighting misreporting, many employers report a set of disclosures that are together mathematically impossible. Further, a disproportionate number of employers report perfectly balanced gender statistics, consistent with misreporting as a form of ESG-washing. Suggesting that a lack of ethical considerations encourages misreporting, employers involved in ESG controversies and who commit labor violations are more likely to misreport. Suggesting that capital market and media scrutiny discourage misreporting, employers that are the subject of an article about their gender pay gap reports and employers that receive an ESG audit or financial audit from a Big 4 auditor are less likely to misreport. Overall, our results suggest that 12%–15% of employers misreport in 2017 and 8%–11% misreport in subsequent years. Our findings highlight the importance of meaningful oversight within the context of ESG reporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05125 .</content>

    <title>Capitalism Versus Socialism: Can (or Should) Management Scholars Embrace Varieties of Socio‐Economic Systems in a Multipolar World?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an increasingly multipolar world, thisPoint–Counterpointdebate discusses the imperative for Management and Organization Studies (MOS) to embrace different contexts of socio‐economic systems, specifically varieties of socialism, and in doing so move beyond the predominant capitalist model as a central assumption in the literature. In theirPoint, Bruton, Li and Gautam argue that MOS has insufficiently embraced socialism as an empirical reality, despite nearly half of the world’s population living in nations reflecting some variety of socialism, in addition to modes of organization following an ethos closer to socialism than capitalism. This view is challenged by theCounterpointof Foss, Klein, Holmes and Terjesen. While they agree that considering institutional context is vital, they reject thePoint’sposition, question its imputing of a widespread ‘capitalist bias’, and are concerned that its ethos‐based definitions are imprecise and politically charged. Based on their productive disagreement, collectively thisPoint–Counterpointdebate underscores the imperative for greater contextualization in MOS more generally, and in entrepreneurship research more specifically, and that organizational goals beyond pure financial profit maximization warrant deeper scholarly attention. This introduction concludes by sketching future research avenues, including configurational institutional analysis, exploring collective motivation in entrepreneurship, and analysing the mechanisms of state control.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Micromanagement (MM) is a popular topic in management circles, where its negative reputation is palpable, and yet academics have not shared this interest. As a result, our understanding of MM is deficient, marred by disjointed definitions and paradoxical views. Our research aims to clarify the construct and measurement of MM through a series of five studies that (1) define the MM construct, (2) develop a psychometrically reliable and valid measure, and (3) validate a preliminary nomological network. Based on combined deductive and inductive approaches, we establish a comprehensive construct definition of MM. Subsequently, we develop and validate a nine-item Micromanagement Scale (MMS-9). Drawing on data from eight distinct samples encompassing 1,723 individuals employed across diverse industries, we found that (a) MM is a hierarchical construct comprising three related core attributes (i.e., controlling, close monitoring, detail focus) and three key features (i.e., excessive, sustained, unnecessary), (b) the MMS-9 exhibits nomological validity, as evidenced by its significant relationships with theorized antecedents (e.g., low trust and leader-member exchange) and consequences (e.g., high turnover intentions and emotional exhaustion), and (c) the MMS-9 demonstrates discriminant and incremental validity against relevant orbiting leadership constructs (i.e., authoritarian leadership, participative leadership, empowering leadership, initiating structure, directive leadership, and abusive supervision). We discuss the implications of the MMS-9’s availability for advancing the study of micromanagement, with particular focus on potential avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>It’s Different: Examining the Effect of HRM Investments on Employee Downsizing Following Mergers and Acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although some scholars in strategic human resource management (SHRM) research have suggested that HRM investments can be effective in reducing the negative repercussions of employee downsizing, other scholars have argued that such HRM investments could convey contradictory messages to employees, resulting in more negative employee reactions and decreased firm performance. In this research, we addressed this unsettled question by looking into the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) context, where we theorized that the acquiring firm’s HRM investments can positively moderate the negative effect of employee downsizing on firm performance by invoking positive sensemaking processes from remaining acquired firm employees. Moreover, the positive sensemaking effects of HRM investments extend beyond remaining acquired firm employees to influence the overall performance of the merged firm. We examined established HRM investments by acquiring firms prior to the M&amp;A and additional HRM investments made after the M&amp;A. Using a representative sample of 5,467 firm-year observations from 1,214 U.S. publicly traded firms between 2002 and 2018, we found that both pre- and post-acquisition HRM investments by acquiring firms mitigate the negative effect of employee downsizing following M&amp;A on firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for both research and practice.</content>

    <title>More Than Words: A Risk Regulation Model of Supervisor Gratitude Expression, Felt Appreciation, and Subordinate Voice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Feeling appreciated is integral to developing and sustaining high-quality relationships, yet many employees do not feel appreciated at work. Drawing on risk regulation theory for interdependent relationships, we developed a risk regulation model of supervisor gratitude expression, felt appreciation, and subordinate voice. We propose that when a supervisor’s agentic or communal gratitude expression aligns with a subordinate’s preference, the subordinate will experience greater felt appreciation and thus engage more in voice—a relationally risky behavior. First, we followed a five-step scale-development process using four distinct samples to create and validate measures of supervisors’ agentic and communal gratitude expression and subordinates’ corresponding preferences. We then tested our model in a multiwave, multisource field survey with 124 supervisor–subordinate dyads. We found that the congruence (incongruence) between supervisor gratitude expression and subordinate preference was positively (negatively) related to subordinate felt appreciation and subsequent voice, with distinct patterns emerging for supervisor agentic and communal expression. Further, in two supplementary experiments, we demonstrated that felt appreciation promotes voice via perceived regard and perceived reduction of relational risk. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, highlighting the importance of distinguishing the two types of supervisor gratitude expressions and their responsiveness to subordinate preferences while outlining promising avenues for research on gratitude and felt appreciation at work.</content>

    <title>Bottom‐up effects of female strategic leadership: Firm performance effects through employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have found that female representation in strategic leadership is often positively associated with firm performance, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Prior explanations emphasize top‐down effects, considering how female leaders shape strategic decision‐making or influence legitimacy. We propose a complementary, bottom‐up view: female top managers foster employee participation, which is positively associated with firm performance. Using a unique panel dataset from South Korea, we find that female representation in top management is linked to higher employee participation, which mediates its relationship with firm performance. The benefits of employee participation are especially pronounced in firms with innovation‐oriented or labor‐intensive strategies. By integrating micro‐level employee behaviors with macro‐level firm outcomes, our study shows how female strategic leaders contribute to firm performance through a top‐enabled, bottom‐up process.Managerial SummaryWhy do firms with more women in top management perform better? Our study suggests that one important pathway lies in how female executives may foster employee participation. Drawing on a unique panel dataset from South Korea, we find that organizations with more women in top management tend to have higher levels of employee participation in decision‐making, and that such participation is associated with stronger performance outcomes. This effect is especially evident in firms that depend on innovation or human capital, where employee input and commitment are particularly valuable. By highlighting how female strategic leaders help create conditions that elevate employee voice, our findings reveal a bottom‐up process through which strategic leadership diversity may support improved organizational performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Considering human motivation, is it more effective to assign work tasks to shop floor workers or let them choose among a set of open tasks? This paper reports the results of a field experiment conducted with a manufacturer that uses wearable devices to distribute shop floor tasks. Drawing on theory on human motivation, we analyze 66,233 machine status reports and 31,429 work tasks completed in two manufacturing plants in Germany and Italy. We rely on a Difference-in-Differences approach in a 13-week-long field experiment. The results show that allowing workers to choose their next task shows no aggregate productivity difference but reveals heterogeneous behavioral effects. We find that workers respond more slowly to tasks (response time), but once accepted, tasks are completed faster (completion time). We discuss the potentially canceling effects and uncover evidence for behavioral mechanisms such as social loafing. This study has significant consequences for production managers in charge of implementing choice-based digital task assignment systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gaming industry has emerged as a critical force in the digital content economy, yet managing user behavior to drive sustained activity and monetization remains a complex operational challenge. In this study, we propose a two-layer Hidden Markov Model to capture users’ gameplay and payment behaviors by constructing a play-then-pay chain that links user engagement to subsequent purchase intention dynamics. Drawing on a real-world dataset, we uncover three levels of engagement states measuring the degree of stickiness with the focal game, as well as two levels of purchase intention states describing one’s willingness to pay. We find that a higher engagement state is associated with a volatile transition pattern and leads to a higher upward transition tendency in purchase intention, while low and medium engagement states tend to maintain a low purchase intention state. We also examine several factors that affect the transitions of these psychological states. The analysis reveals that user activity in same-type games enhances upward transitions only among users in the medium engagement state, without affecting users in the high engagement state, and exhibits no significant effect on purchase intentions. In contrast, user activity in different types of games has a negative effect on users in both low and high engagement states. Our state-dependent outcomes suggest that the managers’ strategies are more effective when targeted toward users with low engagement and purchase intention states. Further experimental analysis supports the effectiveness of the proposed play-then-pay chain for predicting users’ behaviors. Our policy simulation demonstrates that traffic subsidization effectively redirects user attention to the focal game, with interventions targeting different-type games yielding greater improvements in propensities for both gameplay and payment behavior compared to same-type games. Our work provides managerial implications for platform managers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Channel Encroachment and Supply Chain Performance: The Effects of IoT Data Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has enabled IoT device manufacturers to collect consumer usage data (IoT data) whenever their devices are in use. Our paper examines the following setting: A manufacturer collects IoT data and decides whether to share it with a retailer, while consumers remain concerned about their privacy; the retailer, in turn, can leverage the shared data for cross-selling by investing in data-mining efforts that transform raw data into actionable insights. This aspect of data mining differentiates our study from traditional research on information sharing. Beyond selling through the existing retail channel, the manufacturer also has the option to establish a direct channel, thereby encroaching on the retailer’s market. Our analysis reveals several key insights. First, when the manufacturer both encroaches and shares IoT data, we observe a counterintuitive positive effect of the channel substitution rate: As the substitution rate increases, both the manufacturer and the retailer may see higher profits. Second, while the manufacturer always chooses to encroach when data sharing is absent, its motivation to do so weakens when it shares IoT data. Finally, we find that an increase in the value of IoT data can unexpectedly lead to a decline in the retailer’s profit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper “Foresee the Next Line: Customer Strategies and Information Disclosure in Tandem Queues” examines how queue-length information affects customer behavior in multistage services, such as visiting the Apple Store—where you first wait to check in and then wait for a technician. It focuses on a two-stage tandem queue: an admission queue followed by a treatment queue. In the fully observable model, customers see both queues before entering the system, and the equilibrium joining strategy depends on the exact queue lengths rather than just their sum. In the partially observable model—which is more common in practice—customers initially see only the first queue and find the second queue’s length after completing the first stage. In this case, a threshold equilibrium emerges. Comparing models, the partially observable version generally yields higher throughput but lower social welfare. Results combine exact analysis in special regimes with extensive numerical computations.</content>

    <title>Does Personality Similarity Influence the Formation of Auditor-in-Charge–Client Relationships and Audit Quality? Evidence from Swedish Military Conscription Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of personality similarity in the formation of auditor-in-charge (AIC)–client management dyads and the development of a collaborative relationship in auditing engagements. We apply the principle of homophily from sociology, that is, the attraction of individuals with similar traits to one another, to the formation of supplier–customer dyads in auditing engagements. Our analyses suggest that AIC–management personality similarity increases the likelihood of dyad formation and facilitates client retention. Using an instrumental variable approach, we further find evidence that AIC–chief executive officer (CEO) personality similarity enhances audit quality, and that this effect is stronger for clients with higher misreporting risk and at the beginning of the AIC–client tenure relationship. Among publicly listed clients, where chief financial officer (CFO) data are available, we find that AIC–CFO personality similarity plays a more important role in AIC–client matching and audit outcomes than AIC–CEO personality similarity. Collectively, our results suggest that a personality homophily-based relationship facilitates collaboration in auditing engagements, ultimately enhancing audit quality. Overall, our evidence highlights the benefit of interpersonal relationships in the production of audit services.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Penn State Smeal College of Business, the Handelsbanken Jan Wallanders and Tom Hedelius Foundation [Grants P25-0334 and W21-0009], the Torsten Söderbergs Foundation [Grant ET4/17], and the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets at the Stockholm School of Economics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04195 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees identify with multiple groups at work, each with distinct values and behavioral expectations. Though the identification literature argues that the relative effects of different identification groups vary depending on their subjective importance and situational relevance, identification is still largely conceptualized as stable, independent, and static. This ignores how different identifications might fluctuate in salience throughout the day and how they might influence each other. We extend the identification literature through the development of a theoretical model of dynamic identification—demonstrating that workplace conflict is a primary mechanism through which identification fluctuates, as well as the simultaneous effects of different identifications (i.e., team and organization) on important workplace outcomes. In a multistudy approach including two ESM studies and supplemental experiments, we demonstrate that increased conflict in a focal group reduced focal group identification salience and that this effect was strengthened when nonfocal group conflict was low, such that the nonfocal identification represented a “greener pasture” compared to the focal group.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the emergence of new technologies (e.g., online payment systems) and new service contexts (e.g., app-based services), the use of tip recommendations is becoming increasingly prevalent. Based on one large secondary dataset analysis (176,237 food delivery orders) and nine experiments, this research identifies an effective and easily implementable tip recommendation design—materially referenced tip recommendations (ie, referencing a product that financially equates to the suggested tip amount) to increase tips. The effect of materially referenced tip recommendations is sequentially driven by the vivid mental imagery of how the requested tips could be used by the recipient (ie, the consequences of tipping for the recipient) and the heightened perception that tipping serves as a meaningful expression of gratitude to the recipient. This effect is attenuated when the referenced product is perceived as inappropriate for expressing gratitude to the tip recipient.</content>

    <title>Strategic Drivers of Core Expansion on Software Platforms: Evidence from Apple iOS</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Software platforms rely on a core-periphery structure; platform owners provide foundational code that third-party developers extend with complementary software. This structure creates strong incentives for platform owners to cooperate with third-party developers. Yet, platform firms, like Apple, intermittently expand their core by integrating peripheral functionality—for instance, flashlight or screen-time tracking in iOS. If ecosystems thrive on cooperation, why do platform owners expand into niches at the apparent expense of developers? Using a comprehensive data set of all Apple iOS core expansions from 2012 to 2020, we find that expansions systematically target underperforming niches—those with low user satisfaction, limited innovation activity, and high market concentration. Stand-alone apps tend to occur in niches with low innovation, whereas integrated core features focus on niches with low user satisfaction and high concentration. For policymakers, these insights inform regulatory discussions on platform power and the design of public interventions. For platform owners and third-party developers, the findings highlight characteristics of ecosystem niches that are vulnerable to core expansion, supporting strategic decisions regarding cooperation, competition, and innovation investment. By linking niche characteristics to core expansion strategies, this study provides actionable guidance for regulating and managing evolving platform ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Throughout history, both human-made crises and natural disasters have displaced populations, forcing people to leave their homes. This not only results in lasting scars on those who flee but can also profoundly impact entire societies. Drawing from the fields of organizational studies, migration studies, and psychology, we argue that understanding the long-term effects of refugee migration requires a comprehensive examination of the entire refugee journey. During pre-, mid-, and postmigration phases, organizational actors play a pivotal role in shaping refugees’ individual and collective experiences. At the individual level, refugees may experience posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic growth. At the collective level, transgenerational trauma evolves into a shared memory, profoundly influencing the long-term outcomes of refugee migration, which is intersected by coping skills and spillover-crossover effects from work to family. By highlighting the intricate interplay between these psychological processes and organizations, we shed light on how much contemporary society has been—and will continue to be—shaped by the opportunities extended to, or withheld from, refugees. We underscore the imperative for organizational scholarship to more clearly theorize refugee migration as distinct from broader migration phenomena and outline a path forward for research, policy, and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demand in the Shadows: Proxy-Based Solutions for Smarter PricingUnderstanding how price affects customer demand is a cornerstone of data-driven pricing, but traditional approaches often struggle under endogeneity because of the presence of confounding factors. In the paper “Proxy-Aided Demand Learning with an Application to Various Pricing Problems,” Shen and Cui tackle this challenge by leveraging ideas from proximal causal inference. They introduce a framework that incorporates proxy variables—categorized into treatment and outcome types—to enable reliable identification and estimation of customer demand. Central to their method is the use of a bridge function that allows accurate recovery of potential sales at different price points. Besides theoretical and managerial insights, the paper demonstrates practical applications in both static and contextual pricing, with the proposed algorithms applied to a real-world e-commerce data set. Tellingly, the proposed framework offers a promising new direction for practitioners aiming to optimize pricing with confounded data.</content>

    <title>Combining Forecasts from Multiple Experts for Multiple Variables</title>
    <updated>2025-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new method for combining point forecasts from multiple experts across multiple variables to improve inference about an unknown variable. Traditional aggregation methods combine forecasts for each variable separately (we refer to these methods as separate inference methods). However, in practice, each expert frequently provides a forecast for each variable across multiple variables. Because forecast errors can be correlated across the variables, the decision maker may additionally benefit from pooling forecasts for the other variables (we refer to our proposed method as pooled inference). Our model assumes that the forecast error arises from multiple sources of randomness, including a variable-specific factor, an expert-specific factor, a common factor, and idiosyncratic noise. When the covariance structure of the forecast errors is known, we show that the pooled inference is structurally equivalent to the separate inference but with reduced idiosyncratic noise, thereby allowing for more effective weighting of experts’ forecasts. When the covariance structure is unknown, we derive the optimal form for the consensus forecast under the pooled inference, which can be easily implemented. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the pooled inference can outperform widely used separate inference methods in some forecasting environments. Additionally, even when pooling a large number of variables—necessitating the handling of high-dimensional covariance matrices—the pooled inference remains computationally manageable.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The research of Z.

    <title>CEO Pay Ratio Disclosures and Changes in Employee Pay Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether CEO pay ratio disclosures were informative to employees about their own pay by estimating the impact of the disclosures on employee pay satisfaction. Exploiting the staggered timing of the pay ratio disclosures, we find that employee pay satisfaction increased after their firms’ disclosures as measured by their ratings of their firms’ compensation and benefits on Glassdoor. We show that these findings are not driven by alternative information in proxy statements, general trends in employee satisfaction, ratings manipulation, or concurrent changes in employee pay levels. Instead, we posit that the new information in the disclosures about median worker pay levels caused employees to perceive their own pay levels more favorably. Consistent with this explanation, we find that the increases in pay satisfaction are greatest within firms that had relatively small median worker pay levels and those that had relatively opaque pay information environments before the disclosure. Overall, our findings reveal a positive externality of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s mandate on human capital disclosures, potentially informing future policy making.This paper was accepted by Jan Bouwens, accounting.Funding: The authors thank Boston College, Tsinghua University, Tulane University, the University of Arizona, the Carol Lavin Bernick Faculty Grant Program, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72402110, 72442014] for providing financial support for this project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08151 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a no-arbitrage framework for stochastic discount factors (SDFs) that satisfy convex pricing constraints in markets characterized by a wide range of trading frictions. We demonstrate a duality relationship connecting minimum dispersion SDFs to portfolio optimization problems with penalty functions directly capturing the underlying frictions. Empirically, we examine how mispricing impacts the SDF’s effectiveness in explaining both cross-sectional and time series variation in asset returns. We find that a minimum-variance SDF, constructed by combining the capital asset pricing model SDF with a portfolio that constrains the mispricing of nonmarket risks, achieves a favorable tradeoff between time series and cross-sectional fit.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05750 .</content>

    <title>Innovate or litigate? The dual impacts of multimarket contacts on global competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study, grounded in the multimarket competition, knowledge management, and technological change literature, investigates how multimarket contacts among multinational enterprises—i.e., the extent to which rival multinational enterprises meet simultaneously in multiple countries—shape their innovation and patent litigation decisions in host countries. We propose that the degree of multimarket contacts a multinational enterprise has with its competitors in a host country may restrain it from aggressively launching product and technological innovations in that country due to a fear of cross-country retaliation. However, increased multimarket contacts also facilitate knowledge diffusion, heightening the risk of imitation, and consequently enhance the multinational enterprise’s patent litigation intensity—a means to protect knowledge-based resources—in that country. Moreover, we examine how two features of the host-country technological environment—technological ferment (an era of intense technical variation following a technological discontinuity until a dominant design emerges) and home–host country differences in intellectual property protection—moderate these relationships. We test our hypotheses using a dataset of 85 mobile phone vendors, which includes data on their products and technological innovations and litigation cases in 46 countries between 2003 and 2015. This study sheds light on the interplay among multinational enterprises’ multimarket contacts, innovation, and patent litigation.</content>

    <title>The Creation of Immersive Experiences in Transcultural Entertainment: An Action Design Process Focused on Neural Rendering</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically neural facial reenactment (NFR), can address the limitations of dubbing and subtitling in adapting foreign films. Using action design research and guided by presence theory, we codeveloped and evaluated an NFR process during the English adaptation of the Polish feature film The Champion. Unlike conventional dubbing, which often disrupts immersion through poor lip-sync or script changes, NFR preserves the original actors’ performances, aligning them with new dialogue. Independent broadcast-quality assessments confirmed technical validity, and subsequent commercial distribution on a major streaming platform demonstrated scalability and audience acceptance. From this process, we derived six design principles: avoid forced script changes, respect creative intent, minimize intrusive technology, reduce training data requirements, enable flexible audience access, and codesign with existing creative structures. These principles offer a replicable template for the responsible researching and developing of AI in information systems. For practice, the findings show that NFR can improve cultural accessibility and create new creative and technical roles rather than displacing talent. For policy, the study highlights the importance of codesign, transparency, and preserving artistic integrity when integrating AI into global cultural products.</content>

    <title>How to Tell a (News) Story? Quantifying the Impact of News Format and Storytelling on Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media has transformed how people consume news, making storytelling design as important as headline design. We examine three storytelling design features—narrativity (linear versus summary first), emotional sequence (good to bad versus bad to good), and reading level (simple versus complex)—and show that their effects on engagement depend on both news format and audience motivation.We find that effective engagement requires conditional rather than universal rules. For satirical content, humor enhances engagement mainly among motivated audiences, where higher narrativity and complex language paired with bad-to-good emotional sequences work best. For less motivated audiences, simpler satire is more effective when presented in summary-first form with good-to-bad sequences. For traditional news, prior work suggests that simple language helps; whereas we find this to be generally true, our results show that when complex language is unavoidable, pairing it with linear narrativity and bad-to-good sequences can enhance engagement. These results provide guidance for publishers who must balance clarity, complexity, and audience expectations.Beyond news, our findings generalize to videos, podcasts, and interactive media, where storytelling design similarly shaped engagement. We also demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can generate controlled story variations, enabling creators to scale production and platforms to optimize recommendations in audience-specific ways.</content>

    <title>Contract Selection and Piracy Surveillance for Video Platforms in the Age of Social Media</title>
    <updated>2025-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pirated video clips, a new form of piracy, have spread rapidly in recent years with the vigorous development of short‐video social media platforms such asTikTokandDouyin. This has led to a huge loss of revenue for the film and TV drama industry where the negative economic impact trickles down from legitimate video platforms to content creators. As video platforms fight back against copyright infringement, they need to decide how much effort to invest in detecting and taking down pirated video clips that emerge on social media platforms. In addition, they need to decide whether a lump sum or unit price contract should be used to secure the playing rights for a video from the content creator. A content creator has no incentive to engage in piracy surveillance together with the video platform after signing a lump sum contract but has an incentive to do so after signing a unit price contract because he/she would receive royalties each time someone watches the copyrighted video. Using an analytical model framework, we find that the video platform should use a unit price contract when production of the video is less costly for the same quality (e.g., music‐based, horror, and romance movies) but a lump sum contract when production is costly (e.g., Sci‐fi, animation, and fantasy genres). We show that in equilibrium, the total surveillance effort between the video platform and the content creator is smaller and the video platform charges customers less to watch the copyrighted video under the lump sum contract compared to the unit price contract. As a result, the lump sum contract not only achieves higher consumer surplus compared to the unit price contract but also leads to a higher percentage of customers legally accessing the video program. Finally, the content creator's revenue is the same under both contracts, but the content creator may prefer the lump sum contract because it attracts more (legal or illegal) viewers and the increased visibility could be beneficial in the long run.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Paradoxes in the Sharing Economy: Empirical Evidence from Airbnb</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Challenging conventional epistemological stances, we unravel two paradoxes of communication strategies in the emerging context of sharing economy. Specifically, the conformity–distinctiveness paradox asserts that differing from hotels improves hosts’ economic performance, but such economic benefit diminishes when deviating from the norms in hospitality settings. The economic–social paradox propounds that positioning away from hotels improves social performance but may not result in optimal economic gains. Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of strategic categorization and optimal distinctiveness, we collect and analyze data from a sample of Airbnb listings. Utilizing multiple estimation models and identification strategies, we find that hosts can improve their economic performance by differing from hotels, but such economic gains diminish beyond a certain point. Furthermore, deviating from hotels also increases hosts’ social performance, especially when direct host–guest interactions occur in shared apartments. Our empirical findings provide compelling evidence for the two paradoxes in the context of sharing economy, extend the discourse on strategic categorization, and elucidate the effects of listing narratives conveyed through social technologies. This study also sheds new light on how operations management and service providers can exploit the communicative and linguistic perspectives of user-generated content.</content>

    <title>Understanding of the Dynamics of Mobile Reading: An HMM Model of User Engagement and Content Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding consumers’ engagement and subsequent content consumption behavior in the mobile context is critical to mobile app providers. In this paper, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the dynamics of users’ engagement states and consumption decisions on the number of books/chapters read and the amount of money spent. Our method allows us to simultaneously capture three interdependent usage behaviors using a single integrated model and identify the impact of content loading time and previous reading behavior on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption. We calibrate the model using a tap stream data set of individual users’ reading activities on a mobile app. Our analysis reveals three distinct engagement states, a low state with inactive users, a medium state with users sampling books, and a high state with users reading intensively. Furthermore, we find that content loading time has higher negative impacts on high-state users in state transitioning than medium-state users. In contrast, the days that elapsed since the last visit has a similar negative impact on the users in the high and medium states. The effect of usage frequency on users in state transitioning is always positive. We have also identified the weekend effect and social influence on users’ reading outcomes. Finally, our simulations quantify the shortened content loading time and the days elapsed since the last visit on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption decisions, which generate important managerial implications for app providers.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Signaling Blockchain‐Based Track and Trace on Consumer Purchases: Insights From a Quasi‐Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain‐based track and trace (BCT) is increasingly adopted in the retail supply chain. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence quantifying the effects of BCT on consumer purchases or examining the heterogeneity of these effects with varying product‐related characteristics. Employing transactional data from a leading global e‐retailer that contains 540 stock keeping units (SKUs), we design a quasi‐natural experiment spanning 80 weeks to estimate the signaling effect of BCT (i.e., disclosure of the BCT to consumers) on consumer purchases. Drawing on the signaling theory, we propose that BCT can serve as an effective and reliable signal of the product quality and trustworthiness of the retailer. Our research uncovers significant positive effects of BCT on the average purchase quantity per buyer, the total number of buyers, the number of new buyers, and the number of unique visitors to the traced products. We also find nuanced moderation effects for two product‐related characteristics—namely, consumer review inconsistency and product origins—on the influence of BCT on consumer purchases. Specifically, the signal effectiveness of BCT is stronger for products with more inconsistent customer reviews that indicate greater information asymmetry. The effect of BCT for products sourced globally is magnified because of the high BCT signal reliability attributed to the unique properties of the blockchain. The heterogeneous effects of BCT by varying product‐related characteristics can inform managers in selecting the right products to implement BCT.</content>

    <title>Taxes and Executive Pay: Evidence from Nonqualified Deferred Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the influence of tax deductibility on decisions to defer executive compensation by exploiting a plausibly exogenous tax change that increases the deductibility of the chief financial officer’s (CFO’s) nonperformance-based compensation, with no impact on the nontax determinants of deferrals. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I find that CFO deferred compensation significantly decreases after the tax change, relative to the deferrals of the chief executive officer (CEO) and the highest paid non-CEO and non-CFO executive in the same firm. This finding is more pronounced for firms with higher marginal tax rates and thus greater tax benefits of deferrals. Additional tests show that tax deductibility also influences firms’ decisions on nonperformance-based compensation and that CFO total pay appears to decline in response to decreased deferrals.This paper was accepted by Shivaram Rajgopal, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01483 .</content>

    <title>Spectral Volume Models: Universal High-Frequency Periodicities in Intraday Trading Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop spectral volume models to systematically estimate, explain, and exploit the high-frequency periodicity in intraday trading activities using Fourier analysis. The framework consistently recovers periodicities at specific frequencies in three steps, despite their low signal-to-noise ratios. This reveals persistent and universal high-frequency periodicities in the United States and Chinese stock markets in recent years, and the dominant frequencies explain a significant fraction of the total variance of intraday volumes. We provide evidence that this phenomenon likely reflects the behaviors of trading algorithms with repeated and regular trading instructions. Finally, we demonstrate that uncovering such high-frequency periodicities improves intraday volume predictions and volume weighted average price execution qualities, yields insights for price informativeness of algorithmic trading, and generates excess returns.This paper was accepted by William Lin Cong, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant 2022YFA1007900], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12271013 and 72342004], and the Peking University’s Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06215 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Price distortions created by so-called “pump-and-dump” schemes are well documented, but relatively little is known about the investors in these schemes. By examining 470 pump-and-dump schemes and a large data set of trading records for over 110,000 individual investors from a major German bank, we provide comprehensive evidence on the participation rate, the magnitude of the investments, the losses, and the characteristics of the individuals who invest in such schemes. Participation is quite common, with nearly 8% of active retail investors participating in at least one pump-and-dump losing on average nearly 30%. We identify several distinct types of participating investors, some of which (e.g., speculating day trader) should not be viewed as falling prey to the schemes. We also show that portfolio composition and past trading behavior better explain scheme participation than demographics. Last, we document longer-lasting effects on participating investors beyond their immediate financial losses. Our analysis highlights that an effective regulatory response to pump-and-dump schemes requires understanding who invests in such schemes and why, as, for instance, not all investors are likely to be dissuaded from investing by traditional regulatory disclosures.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Clark Center for Global Markets at the University of Chicago and the Danish Finance Institute.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03181 .</content>

    <title>To Claim or Not To Claim? Hidden Costs of Business Page Claiming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many digital platforms encourage small business owners to “claim” their pages to improve visibility and connect with customers. Yet, despite its apparent benefits and zero financial cost, many pages remain unclaimed. Using a unique data set from Yelp and a staggered difference-in-differences design, this study reveals a hidden downside of business page claiming; average customer ratings drop by 10.3%, driven by more one-star reviews and fewer five-star reviews. Customers also write longer, more negative reviews and address owners more directly about service issues. These findings indicate that claiming a business page signals owner presence and raises customer expectations for responsiveness, which many small businesses may not be equipped to meet. For practitioners, the results highlight that business page claiming, although free, is not costless; it creates reputational risk if service quality or responsiveness falls short of heightened expectations. Owners should claim their pages only when ready to actively monitor feedback or engage in managerial responses. Platforms should also communicate these potential consequences to businesses and design tools that help owners manage customer interactions more effectively.</content>

    <title>How Important Is Pay and What Are the Effects (Positive and Negative) of Pay for Performance?: Evaluating Claims and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compensation plays a pivotal role in shaping employee behavior, motivation, and well‐being. Although extant research has explored various dimensions of compensation, questions about how important pay is to employees and concerns (on the part of employers and/or employees) about the unintended negative (in addition to intended positive) consequences of pay and pay for performance (PFP) decisions remain. For employers, these include claims that PFP can provoke undesirable employee behaviors and undermine employee intrinsic motivation and creativity, and that PFP‐related organizational change is difficult to implement successfully. For employees, concerns include claims that PFP programs negatively affect employee health, well‐being, and financial security. We address and evaluate these concerns in light of theory and evidence and emphasize the need to examine not only the potential negative but also the potential positive consequences of pay and PFP decisions. The strength of PFP effects is greater to the degree that pay is important to employees. Further, in the global context, where much of the world has lower income and higher poverty rates than in the higher productivity economies (e.g., the United States, Europe), we often study pay's importance and thus PFP's impact may be greater.</content>

    <title>Microstructure of “Both/And”: SMART Strategies for Simultaneously Engaging Paradoxical Opposites</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on organizational paradoxes emphasizes the importance of both/and thinking and action. Yet, while often treated as a unitary concept, both/and has been interpreted and operationalized in diverse ways—such as ambidexterity, transcendence, Yin-Yang balancing, and Zhong-Yong middle way. To enhance conceptual clarity and coherence, this paper decomposes the notion of both/and and identifies generic strategies for simultaneously engaging paradoxical opposites. I begin by reviewing individual responses and prior classifications of responses to paradoxical tensions, which reveals five distinct responses beyond either/or logics. Building on these, I develop a typology that specifies and relates five variants of both/and thinking. These are organized into five ideal types—superficial Either-And, multiversal Both-Or, ambivalent Both-And, reconciliatory Both-Nor, and transcendent Neither-And—collectively forming the acronym SMART. I illustrate the application of the SMART framework by analyzing how organizations navigate the profitability versus responsibility tension, a paradox central to modern business practice. I conclude the paper by identifying the limitations of the present study and avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>When Local Learning Scales: Entrepreneurs’ Initial Users and Market Expansion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entering new markets is crucial for technology startups to scale, yet these ventures often face high uncertainty about demand in these markets. This study examines how the composition of initial users shapes startups’ new market growth amid such uncertainty. It theorizes that startups face a learning tradeoff when targeting a foreign market: Local initial users, who are more familiar to the startups, provide clearer signals due to shared language and norms; however, more representative foreign users provide more transferable insights about the target market. Using variation in feature timing on a product platform, this study finds that startups with a higher share of local initial users prior to platform launch experience greater growth in foreign users afterward. This effect is stronger when startups are based in more linguistically homogeneous countries and operate in globally standardized digital product categories, settings where the clarity benefits of local signals outweigh their transferability costs. In contrast to prior work suggesting that startups should begin with target users, this study reveals contexts when more familiar initial users can better foster new market growth and prevent premature scaling.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17983 .</content>

    <title>Behavioral Simulation of Blockchain-Enabled Market for Supplier Capacity Trading Among Retailers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain distribution system and investigate experimentally operations of markets where retailers can trade digital claims (tokens) on the supplier’s capacity. Subjects play the role of retailers, have heterogeneous valuations of goods, face random demands, and buy tokens on the supplier’s capacity. Following demand realization, retailers trade tokens with each other in markets implemented as double-sided, single-price, blind, batch auctions. We compare six behavioral treatments, featuring two wholesale prices and three market sizes. As expected, markets reduce leftovers and shortages. Interestingly, market-clearing prices are anchored to wholesale prices and do not signal the value of goods in large markets. Players deploy novel ordering and trading strategies that differ from the transshipment literature. We identify strategies by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In one strategy, players buy a few claims and, after demand realization, use the market to satisfy it. Other players buy more claims than the maximum demand and, once demand is known, sell their excess on the market. Both strategies reduce costs from demand uncertainty but expose players to liquidity and mistakes risks. A third strategy, in which players order from the supplier initially as if expecting the market to be cleared cooperatively, is more profitable. This strategy diversifies demand and market risks. The introduction of markets causes the “pull-to-the-mean” effect and increases order variability. Thus, markets can cause the Bullwhip Effect. Retailers’ and the supply chain’s average profits are higher with markets, but suppliers with low wholesale prices suffer from lower revenues because of the pull-to-the-mean effect.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03771 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Direct experience of a peer’s punishment might have a sobering effect above and beyond deterrence (information about punishments). We test this mechanism in China, studying the reactions to listed state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) punishments for fraudulent loan guarantees by firms in the same location (peers) and nonpeer firms across SOEs and non-SOEs. After experiencing SOEs’ punishments, peer SOEs cut their loan guarantees by more than nonpeer SOEs and peer non-SOEs even if information and local economic shocks are common to all firms. The reaction is stronger for peer SOEs whose CEOs have higher career concerns and/or face lower costs of reducing loan guarantees.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03309 .</content>

    <title>Representing Random Utility Choice Models with Neural Networks</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the successes of deep learning, we propose a class of neural network–based discrete choice models, called RUMnets, inspired by the random utility maximization (RUM) framework. This model formulates the agents’ random utility function using a sample average approximation. We show that RUMnets sharply approximate the class of RUM discrete choice models: Any model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a RUMnet. Reciprocally, any RUMnet is consistent with the RUM principle. Our approach is closely related to ranking-based models and mixtures of multinomial logits proposed in previous literature in a more general contextual setting. We derive an upper bound on the generalization error of RUMnets fitted on choice data and provide theoretical insights on their ability to predict choices on new unseen data depending on critical parameters of the data set and architecture. The models are estimated by leveraging open-source libraries for training neural networks. We find that RUMnets are competitive against several choice modeling and machine learning methods in terms of predictive accuracy on two real-world data sets. We also conduct synthetic experiments that isolate the effects of each architecture component.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: A.

    <title>Whence LASSO? A Rational Interpretation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an economic setting to rationalize the use of the “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator” (LASSO) in estimating asset returns. In this setting, multiple traders engage in trading based on information extracted from historical asset prices. Facing model uncertainty in forecasting asset returns, these traders adopt robust-trading strategies. Within this context, the use of LASSO for estimating asset returns emerges endogenously as an equilibrium outcome. We further extend our analysis to rationalize the application of elastic-net estimation. Although LASSO-type strategies enhance traders’ profits by mitigating competition among them, they also introduce biases in trading decisions, which can adversely affect profitability. This dual effect highlights the nuanced tradeoffs associated with employing such estimation techniques in financial markets.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on AI for Finance and Business Decisions.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2021-0040] and the Bank of Canada [Fellowship].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06127 .</content>

    <title>Breaking Barriers: Scaffolding Social‐Symbolic Work for Women’s Economic Empowerment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances the understanding of Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) in non‐Western contexts by theorizing how social‐symbolic work facilitates empowerment despite entrenched institutional and cultural constraints. Drawing on a qualitative study into the establishment of Kuwait’s first women’s business incubator, we explore how female intrapreneurs engaged in three interrelated forms of social‐symbolic work – on selves, organizations, and institutions – to foster women’s entrepreneurship. These scaffolded efforts culminated in the creation of a new social‐symbolic object: the Al Salam business incubator. This incubator functioned not only as a physical space for women to launch and grow businesses, but also as a potent symbol of institutional transformation within a culturally traditional environment. We propose a process model of scaffolding social‐symbolic work, demonstrating how catalytic partnerships and dynamic interdependencies across multiple levels of social life can collectively dismantle systemic barriers to female entrepreneurship. By conceptualizing scaffolding as a temporal and integrative process, this study contributes to WEE scholarship and deepens theoretical insights into social‐symbolic work by revealing how diverse forms of work interlock to shape new identities, practices, and institutional arrangements.</content>

    <title>How Institutional Context Affects Narcissistic CEOs’ CSR Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narcissistic CEOs have been found to invest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) in prior research, but the empirical results are not straightforward. To address this, we bring in the institutional context as a moderator. We build on neo-institutional theory to argue that the institutional context shapes what audiences value and find legitimate in terms of CSR behaviors: Corporate philanthropy, a form of tactical CSR, is appreciated in liberal market economies (LMEs) but less so in coordinated market economies (CMEs), whereas strategic CSR, which requires a long-term horizon and substantial resource investments, is considered legitimate in CMEs but less so in LMEs. We theorize that narcissistic CEOs will try to pursue excellence (among their peers) in CSR activities that align with the norms and expectations in their institutional context in order to gain praise and avoid disapproval from their audiences and to bolster their moral superiority. Hence, we expect that the institutional context will moderate the relationship between CEO narcissism and CSR behavior such that in LMEs narcissistic CEOs will engage more in philanthropy than their peers but not in strategic CSR, whereas in CMEs they will invest more in strategic CSR but not in philanthropy. We test our predictions using panel data (2002-2023) from 148 large firms and 493 CEOs operating in 18 countries. Our pattern of findings supports our theory. By developing and testing a theoretical mechanism that connects macro-level institutional context with micro-level firm and CEO behavior, we contribute to both strategic leadership and CSR literature.</content>

    <title>Compromise Leadership: Competing Board Subgroups and the Appointment of a Newcomer Chair</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research suggests that firm-specific human capital is important in enabling board chairs to effectively lead their boards in their oversight duties. Despite this, some boards appoint newcomer directors to the chair position. This paper seeks to explain why. Building on power circulation and faultline theories, we posit that boards characterized by strongly divided subgroups with none dominant over the board may have difficulty in agreeing on promoting a director from among their ranks to the chair position, and instead select a board newcomer as a compromise solution. We further argue that this will be moderated by factors that affect either the power dynamics or the degree of contestation on the board. Analyses on a sample of 2,199 board chair appointments at S&amp;P 1500 firms between the years 2001 and 2017 support our hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Gender wage discrimination and the attractiveness of foreign MNC subsidiaries as employers for women</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender wage discrimination is a grand challenge that constrains economic growth worldwide and denies women fair opportunities. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how women’s own experiences of wage discrimination steer their career decisions. We adopt the perspective of job-seeking women and argue that prior exposure to wage discrimination reshapes their employer preferences. Specifically, it can flip the liability of foreignness typically faced by foreign MNCs into a perceived employer advantage because foreign MNCs can deviate from the host country’s gender-biased norms. We study this mechanism for 165,624 female professionals and managers who changed jobs in Denmark between 2002 and 2015, using a pay transparency law from 2006 for identifying the underlying mechanism. We find that women who have suffered larger wage discrimination in domestic employment are more likely to start working for foreign MNC subsidiaries. This effect is weaker in labor markets in which high-performing domestic employers can offer other benefits, such as reputation or job security. The effect is stronger when foreign MNC subsidiaries signal gender fairness through a higher share of women in management. Overall, our findings show how wage discrimination redirects female career paths, transforming a grand challenge into a strategic advantage for foreign MNCs.</content>

    <title>Third-country MNEs, trade wars, and competitive opportunities: a real-options perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While geopolitical conflicts, including trade wars, have garnered substantial scholarly attention in recent years, the impact on the outsider firms not directly involved in such conflicts remains underexplored. Engaging in real-options informed analysis, we examine how MNEs from third countries may respond to trade wars by capitalizing on the potential for competitive opportunities: where trade wars prompt the scaling up of third-country subsidiary operations in the involved countries. We further explore how the strategic responses of third-country MNEs to the opportunities presented by a trade war can be enhanced by the strategic flexibility manifest in parent-MNE multinationality, the resources and networks embedded in local partners, and the presence of bilateral economic agreements. Employing the 2018 US–China trade war as an empirical context, our panel data encompass 3601 Chinese subsidiary operations for outsider MNEs hailing from 51 countries, which yields 14,404 annual subsidiary-level observations to conduct difference-in-differences analysis. The empirical results indicate that third-country MNEs disproportionately expanded their Chinese operations in response to the US–China tariff conflict, and that these strategic responses were pronounced for subsidiaries with highly multinational parents, local partnerships in the involved country, and a home–host country bilateral agreement.</content>

    <title>Can Crowdchecking Curb Misinformation? Evidence from Community Notes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, whereas traditional countermeasures struggle to balance effectiveness, scalability, and free expression. Many platforms are now experimenting with crowdsourced fact-checking—systems that rely on users’ collective judgment to identify and annotate misleading content. This paper investigates the efficacy of such systems in curbing misinformation in the context of Community Notes, a pioneering crowdsourced fact-checking system from Twitter/X. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that publicly displaying community notes significantly increases and accelerates the voluntary retraction of misleading tweets, demonstrating the viability of crowd-based fact-checking as an alternative to professional fact-checking and forcible content removal. The effect is primarily driven by authors’ reputational concerns and social pressure when corrections are visible to the public. Our findings carry meaningful implications for practice and policy. Individuals can play an active role by contributing to crowdchecking, strengthening collective information integrity. Platforms should adopt transparent, community-based systems, like Community Notes, as scalable, less controversial alternatives to forcible content removal. Policymakers can support these initiatives through regulatory guidance that promotes transparency and accountability.</content>

    <title>The role of identity in corporate governance: evidence from gender differences in the audit committee chair-chief financial officer dyad</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of identity in corporate governance, focusing on an important dyad: audit committee chair and chief financial officer. Drawing on identity theory, which argues that people have lower trust in those they perceive to be different from themselves, we posit that the audit committee chair’s trust in the chief financial officer is lower when the two are different genders. We find that a gender difference between the two is associated with greater monitoring by the chair, consistent with lower trust. This effect is attenuated when a firm has value-based controls that promote diversity tolerance or when a chief financial officer seems more trustworthy. We find no evidence that the increased monitoring improves financial reporting. However, we find evidence that the increased monitoring generates negative externalities by distracting the chief financial officer, as proxied by lower operational performance. Our findings underscore the importance of identity in corporate governance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies’ strategic alternatives announcements lead to negative future stock returns. First, we investigate whether this anomaly exists. We demonstrate that it is significant and pervasive across years, industries, firm size, and information environments and that it is not driven by confounding variables nor risk. We then investigate why the market misprices the announcements and find that investors appear overly optimistic about a potential merger or acquisition and do not fully incorporate the negative fundamental news conveyed by the announcement. Meanwhile, short sellers exploit the mispricing. We also evaluate market frictions as limits to arbitrage. This study’s contributions are (i) evaluating behavioral and risk explanations for an event that causes extreme stock returns, (ii) challenging investors’ widely held belief that such announcements reflect good news, and (iii) warning investors and analysts about a behavioral bias they might unknowingly adopt.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Process Flexibility Analysis for Production Systems with Differentiated Margins under Supply Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To mitigate supply and demand uncertainties, firms often design highly flexible production networks. This study investigates process flexibility in production systems subject to supply disruptions and stochastic demands with differentiated profit margins. In particular, we model supply disruptions as failures of arcs in the network, with node-based disruptions treated as a special case in which all arcs connected to a node simultaneously fail. To address the cost implications of such disruptions, we investigate the design of process flexibility under a robust optimization framework. We first develop a greedy algorithm under deterministic demand to efficiently evaluate the worst-case disruption scenario, and demonstrate the significant advantage of the alternate long-chain design under such disruptions. Subsequently, under stochastic demand, by introducing themarginal profit group index under disruption(MPGID), we characterize the worst-case total profit as a function of both the flexibility design and demand uncertainty, modeled through a partwise independently symmetric perturbation set. This representation enables direct performance comparisons across different flexibility configurations under disruption risk. For the case involving two products with distinct profit margins under supply disruption risk, we demonstrate that the alternate long-chain design outperforms all other long-chain configurations in terms of worst-case profitability. In addition, in certain cases, arc-based disruptions can be just as devastating as plant-node disruptions, particularly when they lead to the loss of high-margin demand. However, our fragility analysis reveals that this design becomes increasingly vulnerable as disruption risks intensify. To address this issue, we propose an MPGID-based heuristic that systematically generates flexible designs to mitigate both supply and demand uncertainties.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;SOAR ing to Optimality: Smarter Matching Algorithms for On-Demand PlatformsIn “Feature-Based Dynamic Matching,” Y. Chen, Y. Kanoria, A. Kumar, and W. Zhang study dynamic two-sided matching where both customers and service providers are characterized by high-dimensional feature vectors, motivated by platforms like on-demand home services. A key finding is that myopic greedy policies—which match each customer to the best available provider—can be highly suboptimal. The authors introduce SOAR (simulate-optimize-assign-repeat), a forward-looking algorithm that balances immediate match quality against preserving valuable supply for future arrivals. Through a novel analytical framework connecting dynamic matching to empirical optimal transport, they prove SOAR achieves near-optimal regret scaling under various distributional assumptions, establishing fundamental performance limits for feature-based matching problems and as a by-product resolve an open problem from prior work on dynamic spatial matching.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study household finance in the age of FinTech, where digital payments are integrated with various financial services through all-in-one super apps. We hypothesize that increased FinTech adoption via digital payments can lower the nonmonetary costs (e.g., psychological barriers) associated with financial market participation. We find that higher FinTech adoption leads to greater participation and increased risk taking in mutual fund investments. Using distance from Ant as an instrument for FinTech penetration, as well as the exogenous penetration of QRPay in Shenzhen, we further provide causal evidence from digital payment to risky fund investment. Moreover, the effect of FinTech is stronger among individuals who are otherwise more constrained, those with higher risk tolerance, or those living in under-banked counties.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a conditional model of asset returns that allows for good and bad states of the world, depending on bear market risk. Specifically, we generalize existing latent factor models in three ways: we show how to estimate the threshold that identifies the “disappointment” event triggering the bad state of the world, we permit different factor structures for asset returns in good and bad states, and we show how to estimate consistently the conditional risk premia of observable factors from the estimated latent factors. The usefulness of the conditional model is illustrated with an empirical application to a broad cross-section of stock portfolio excess returns.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04276 .</content>

    <title>Tweeting for Money: Social Media and Mutual Fund Flows</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We unveil asset managers’ social media communications as a distinct new channel for attracting flows of money to mutual funds. Combining a database of more than 1.6 million posts on X/Twitter by U.S. mutual fund families with textual analysis, we find that flows of money to mutual funds respond positively to both the number and tone of the posts. Whereas the link between social media communications and flows of money is not explained by conventional marketing efforts, our findings suggest that the social media channel is not independent from asset management companies’ broader marketing strategies. A high-frequency analysis that exploits intraday ETF trade data allows us to isolate the effect of tweets on investor decisions from potential confounders. We then consider and test four different economic mechanisms. The results of these tests do not support the hypothesis that asset managers’ social media communications reduce search costs for potential investors. The results do not support, either, that asset management companies’ Twitter activity increases investor attention or alleviates information asymmetries by communicating performance-relevant information to investors. In contrast, our evidence suggests that asset managers use social media as an effective persuasion tool.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: Both authors acknowledge financial support from the FinTech &amp; Digital Finance Chair at Paris Dauphine - PSL.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the additivity of expectations over different time intervals. For example, when asked about 10-year stock price growth, survey respondents report an expected change that is not equal to, but closer to zero than, the sum of their expectations over two shorter time intervals that cover the same 10 years. Such subadditivity, which we also find in expectations for other economic variables, is irrational, as it cannot stem from aggregating short-term expectations. Model estimates show that the pattern is consistent with a time perception where shorter time intervals have a proportionally larger weight. We also find that the respondents’ degree of additivity is correlated with making larger financial investments.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Science Foundation) via CRC TRR 190 [Grant 280092119].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01558 .</content>

    <title>Government Deleveraging and the Reverse Crowding-In Effect: Evidence from Subnational Debt and Government Contractors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document a novel trade-credit channel through which government deleveraging affects the private economy. Our empirical analysis exploits China’s 2017 deleveraging campaign that reduced local governments’ net financing capacity and a purpose-built data set of listed firms matched with government procurement contracts. Compared with noncontractors, private contractors experience larger increases in accounts receivable and deterioration in financial conditions, leading to fewer investments, worse operating performance, and higher probabilities of ownership changes. The effects are muted among state-owned enterprises, which demonstrate lower productivity. Our findings thus reveal a reverse crowding-in effect whereby government deleveraging adversely affects private firms and reduces allocative efficiency.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05679 .</content>

    <title>From Food Deserts to Fresh Food: The Role of Digital Accessibility in Nutrition Assistance Programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in 10 U.S. households experience food insecurity, with millions of low-income families lacking access to fresh food. In response, federal and state governments recently launched the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Online Purchasing Pilot (SNAP Online), enabling SNAP benefits to cover online food purchases. Although prior research suggests that the SNAP Online program may increase overall food consumption, its impact on fresh food consumption remains unclear. This research leverages NielsenIQ consumer panel data and employs a Difference-in-Differences approach to address this question. Our findings reveal that the SNAP Online program increases fresh food consumption among low-income households by 7.1%. However, the effect is minimal in areas with limited access to online grocery delivery and among households with poor prior fresh food consumption habits. These results underscore the potential of supply-side policies, such as expanding online purchasing options, to improve fresh food consumption. They also highlight the importance of addressing demand-side barriers and enhancing digital accessibility to maximize the effectiveness of nutrition assistance programs.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>EXPRESS: Out of Control: The Interplay of Subjective Poverty and Income on Spending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ spending decisions are shaped not only by their objective financial resources but also by their subjective perceptions of wealth. This research investigates the interplay between subjective poverty (e.g., feeling financially constrained) and income in driving spending. Across five studies including real-world spending data from a U.K. financial management app, longitudinal surveys from Kenya and the United States, and controlled experiments, the authors reveal that subjective poverty increases spending among higher-income consumers but decreases spending among lower-income consumers. That is, wealthy consumers who feel financially poor tend to spend more, whereas poorer consumers who feel financially constrained tend to reduce their spending. Drawing on compensatory control theory, the authors demonstrate that subjective poverty threatens individuals’ sense of personal control over life, but people cope with this diminished sense of control differently based on their available resources. Higher-income individuals engage in compensatory consumption to restore control, while lower-income individuals adopt different strategies, including reduced spending. This research advances the understanding of how psychological and material dimensions of wealth interact to shape consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The unique characteristics of the health care industry have given rise to an intriguing and pervasive form of joint venture between hospitals and physicians known as Physician–Hospital Organization (PHO). With transaction cost analysis as the overarching theory, the authors draw on practitioner insights and literature to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of PHOs and identify the boundary conditions under which PHOs are more likely to enhance patient satisfaction. They test the proposed model using multiyear panel data from 19,134 observations in the U.S. health care industry. The results underscore PHOs’ capability to enhance patient satisfaction with hospital services. The significant main effect grows stronger when the market is characterized by intense competition among hospitals, high mortality rates, urban settings, and high unemployment rates. The post hoc analysis reveals that PHOs can additionally improve patient recommendation of a hospital indirectly through patient satisfaction. This study contributes to research on governance structure and customer satisfaction by establishing a connection between PHO and patient satisfaction and identifying its boundary conditions. The findings highlight several fertile avenues for research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the relation between audit competition, audit quality, and auditor labor hours. Using proprietary data on auditor realization rates, we construct new measures of competition based on theory predicting that abnormal profits will quickly disappear when competition is high but persist over multiple periods when competition is low. We find consistent evidence of persistent abnormal profits among U.S. Big 4 engagements and that individual offices earn persistent abnormal returns, suggesting that the market is not perfectly competitive. Examining the consequences of lower competition, we find that profit persistence is negatively related to audit hours and positively related to audit quality. Although we are cautious about inferring causality, our findings suggest that lower competition is associated with more efficient and effective audits.</content>

    <title>Agent-Based Data Curation Practices: Customer Responses to Human versus Algorithmic Data Requesters in Established Business-to-Business Relationships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increasing value generated through data curation and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) agents that act as human agents, vendor companies in established business-to-business relationships increasingly delegate data curation tasks to algorithmic data requesters (ADRs) instead of human data requesters (HDRs). Using a randomized field experiment with a European pharmaceutical company and a follow-up online experiment, we show how customers respond to ADRs versus HDRs across two tasks: data enrichment (i.e., adding new information) and data reconciliation (i.e., updating existing records). For data enrichment, customers are more likely to agree and complete requests sent by ADRs because they expect lower effort. For data reconciliation requests, customers lean toward HDRs, reflecting stronger accuracy concerns. Interestingly, we observe only a marginal advantage in completion rates for HDRs. These findings advise vendors to match agents to data curation tasks; they should deploy ADRs for data enrichment to reduce customer burden, and they should use HDRs for data reconciliation to address error concerns. Relatedly, vendors should craft emails that match the messaging context; they should frame data enrichment messages around convenience and benefits, and they should frame data reconciliation messages around accuracy, auditability, and risk reduction.</content>

    <title>The coevolution of board interlock networks and corporate strategic actions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies on board interlock networks are divided into two streams, one examining their dynamics; the other, their consequences. We propose that both phenomena—board interlock dynamics and consequences—are interdependent. Applying structuration theory, we explain and empirically demonstrate how firms' corporate strategic actions (specifically, acquisitions and divestitures) influence the creation and dissolution of different types of board interlock network ties and how these interlock ties, in turn, influence firms' corporate strategic actions. Integrating the two research streams, we complement corporate governance literature by demonstrating how corporate strategic actions and certain types of board interlocks coevolve. We contribute to theory on strategic networks by explaining coevolution through a structuration theoretical lens. Lastly, we illustrate methodological advances by using multiplex stochastic actor‐oriented models to analyze coevolution processes.Managerial SummaryThe dynamics of board interlock networks—networks resulting from executive and non‐executive directors serving on multiple boards—and the consequences of such networks have been treated as disjunct topics in prior research. We argue and show empirically that certain types of a firm's board interlocks and its corporate strategic actions (specifically, acquisitions and divestitures) are mutually dependent. Applying network analysis to a longitudinal sample of large German firms, we find that firms adapt their actions to the actions of those firms they have directed interlocks with. Vice versa, corporate strategic actions influence the creation and dissolution of board interlocks. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of board interlock networks play a more prominent role in firms' corporate strategic decisions than commonly assumed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the valuation of state-issued tax-exempt municipal bonds and find that there are significant convenience premia in their prices. These premia parallel those identified in Treasury markets. We find evidence that these premia are tax related. Specifically, the premia are related to measures of tax and fiscal uncertainty, forecast flows into state municipal bond funds, and are directly linked to outmigration from high-tax to low-tax states and to other measures of tax aversion such as IRA and retirement plan contributions. These results suggest that investors are willing to pay a substantial premium to avoid taxes. (JEL G12, G28)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;User-generated content platforms use recommendation systems (RSs) to deliver content from a vast number of creators to a diverse audience based on content quality and its match to consumers’ tastes. Existing research has primarily examined their impact on demand-side factors, such as the quality and variety of content consumption. In contrast, less attention has been paid to their influence on supply-side factors, including creators’ entry and quality decisions and their interaction with users’ content diets. The literature has also largely overlooked the hit-driven nature of content production—where a few “trendy” items attract outsized interest in unpredictable ways. We address these omissions by explicitly modeling creators’ entry and quality decisions. We reveal a tradeoff between the equilibrium content quality and variety produced on a platform. Although increasing the recommended content’s fit to users’ preferences benefits consumers and the platform, emphasizing higher quality may reduce content variety and the emergence of trendy items, potentially lowering overall consumer valuation of the platform. We show that whether emphasizing the quality dimension is detrimental depends on consumers’ valuations for content match and trendiness, the heterogeneity level of their valuations, creators’ capabilities of flexibly choosing their content types, and their barrier to enter the platform. Additionally, consumption variety is a U-shaped function of the emphasis the recommendation system puts on content quality.This paper was accepted by Greg Shaffer, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.00300 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that migration induced by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicts changes in municipal bond yields. Negative migration shocks have made debt more expensive, especially in the areas and bonds most exposed to the work-from-home (WFH) transition. Over the full sample, a one-standard-deviation increase in COVID period out-migration predicts an approximate 4.5-basis-point rise in municipal bond yields, after controlling for a range of local economic factors including state- or core-based statistical area (CBSA)-year fixed effects. This effect is 40% larger for areas in the top decile of WFH exposure and approximately twice as large for transportation-backed bonds. Moreover, areas containing the most exposed bonds (i.e., those with out-migration and high WFH exposure) also experience relatively large post-COVID declines in municipal revenue. Overall, our results suggest that investors have changed their estimates of the level or uncertainty of municipalities’ future cash flows, especially for areas and bonds most exposed to the transition toward remote work.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02674 .</content>

    <title>Firms’ Stock Prices, Stock Returns, and Remaining Lifetime Earnings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document the disconnect between earnings expectations as captured in stock prices and the ultimate realization of earnings over long periods. To do so, we compare firms’ stock prices on the first trading day and the beginning of each year to the realized earnings over their remaining lifetime (RLTEP ratio). We document that the RLTEP ratio, averaged over long periods and over 15,000 U.S. domestic public firms, approximates one, suggesting that expectations match actuals in the aggregate. However, most firms fail to deliver an RLTEP ratio greater than one. Acquisition prices are the largest contributors to the RLTEP ratio, with many surviving firms failing to generate enough earnings even after operating for between 15 and 45 years. The RLTEP ratio for survivors is positively associated with the future RLTEP ratio, future lifetime wealth creation, and future lifetime stock returns. Significant returns-based wealth creation by firms in the short term does not persist in the long term unless it is supported by fundamental wealth creation (high past RLTEP ratio).This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Financial support from SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Columbia Business School, Columbia University, Binghamton University School of Management, and Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03251 .</content>

    <title>Why Do Product Prices Affect Review Ratings? Evidence from a Japanese Online Travel Agency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine why the prices that consumers pay influence their ratings of products. In the context of hotel reviews on an online booking platform, I find that prices have larger impact on ratings when consumers face larger uncertainty about hotel quality, indicating that prices affect satisfaction through consumers’ quality expectation. On the other hand, I find that the mere fact that the reviewer received higher surplus through a lower price by itself is not a primary reason for a higher rating. I also present suggestive evidence of consumer reciprocation, in which consumers experiencing a high-quality staff service likely become more forgiving of higher prices. I show that introductory pricing can have a substantial impact on the distribution of review rankings among new entrants because of the role of prices as quality signals. Understanding the price effect on ratings is crucial to designing review systems robust to potential distortion.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05043 .</content>

    <title>Advancing Abductive Theory Building: Balancing Creative Curiosity and Programmatic Rigour Through ‘Loosely Coupled Abduction’</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Abductive theory building holds much promise for management research. Unlike induction and deduction, abductive theorizing begins with a surprising fact or ‘mystery’ that cannot be accounted in extant knowledge stocks. However, emergent debates about its utility in management research risk becoming polarized, with some scholars promoting abduction as creative guesswork on the one hand (or what we termuncoupled abduction) and others calling for more disciplined programmatic rigour on the other hand (or what we termtightly coupled abduction). Both poles are problematic. In thisPointessay, we develop a middle ground, which we termloosely coupled abduction. It benefits from both creative curiosity and programmatic rigour without succumbing to their respective disadvantages in theory construction. We go on to explore the implications of loosely coupled abduction for building new knowledge in management and organization studies.</content>

    <title>Trade Wars, International Supply Chains, and Business Associations: Historical Evidence from Norway and Portugal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines the 1921–1923 trade war between Norway and Portugal as a historical case for exploring business responses to deglobalization and trade disruption. Focusing on the international supply chains (ISCs) of port wine and salted and dried cod, it investigates how business actors contributed to the recoupling of ISCs after a trade war. Drawing on a history‐to‐theory methodology and extensive archival research, the study offers new theoretical insights into how institutional environments shape business agency during periods of deglobalization. It develops a typology of trade wars structured around two dimensions: the degree of coordination within ISCs and the economic reach of the conflict. The findings demonstrate that, in processes ofsymmetric recoupling, where both nations restore disrupted supply chains on equal terms, business associations as well as multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a pivotal role in business diplomacy and supply‐chain reconstruction. The symmetric nature of the post‐trade war recoupling fosters mutual recovery and enhances long‐term competitiveness for the industries involved. The typology proposed also provides a framework for analysing other historical and contemporary trade wars across diverse geopolitical settings.</content>

    <title>Purposeful Management and the Public Good: Relationships, Tensions, and Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional management practices have long prioritized organizational performance and financial growth, primarily serving shareholder interests. However, escalating societal and environmental challenges – such as climate change, human rights violations, the dismantling of democratic institutions, and public health crises – raise questions about the adequacy of these priorities and call for greater attention to management’s role in advancing the public good. This Special Issue examines the relationships, tensions, and consequences associated with efforts to repurpose management towards broader societal aims. We distinguish between organizational purpose – the stated aspirational goals of firms – and repurposed management, which reflects broader shifts in managerial logic, practices, and institutional expectations aimed at serving the public good. The contributing articles explore how such repurposing is constructed and enacted across institutional settings, and how managerial practices influence governance structures, stakeholder dynamics, and field‐level norms to shape public outcomes – both intended and unintended. By shifting the analytical lens from purpose as internal intent to purpose as institutionally mediated consequence, we invite more inquiry into how, when, and for whom purposeful management contributes to the public good – foregrounding the institutional mechanisms, stakeholder dynamics, and societal outcomes through which purpose is interpreted, negotiated and enacted.</content>

    <title>How Do SMEs Respond to Deglobalization? Insights from Italian SMEs in the Interwar Period (1936–1943)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) respond to deglobalization and economic nationalism, using historical evidence from fascist Italy, a period of autarky and restricted international trade. While prior research has focused primarily on larger firms, especially multinational enterprises (MNEs), the strategic behaviour of the resource‐constrained category of SMEs remains underexplored in both management and business history literatures. Drawing on archival material from the Istituto Mobiliare Italiano and historical sources, we identify four adaptive strategies: (i) market repositioning, (ii) national re‐branding, (iii) disguising core business, and (iv) mobilizing formal ties. Our findings reveal that, while SMEs draw from the strategic playbook of MNEs, they implement these strategies in distinct ways due to internal and external constraints. In doing so, they exhibit both strategic and political ambidexterity to adapt. They leverage their distinctive flexibility and agility by mobilizing internal capabilities (e.g., brand identity), and resources (e.g., formal international ties). This enables SMEs’ market repositioning and allows them to achieve symbolic alignment with government agendas through reshaping narratives to secure critical resources. Ultimately, this leads to bolder strategies like pivoting from global niche to broader domestic markets. This framework offers insights into SMEs’ resilience under deglobalization and economic nationalism.</content>

    <title>Curse or Blessing: Investigating the Influence of Firms’ Artificial Intelligence Adoption on Employee Job Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) growing influence in business has introduced a pivotal shift in workplace dynamics. However, the understanding of how AI adoption influences employee job satisfaction remains inconclusive. Drawing on job characteristics theory, we argue that with increasing levels of adoption, the relationship between employees’ perceived benefits and costs of AI changes, resulting in an inverted U‐shaped relationship between AI adoption and job satisfaction. We further propose that the firm‐level contingencies exploration orientation and data governance moderate the effects of AI adoption on job satisfaction. Using longitudinal data from 509 publicly listed US firms between 2009 and 2020, we find broad support for our hypotheses. To better understand how specific job characteristics may explain these relationships, we conducted follow‐up interviews with employees from our sample firms. Our study contributes to the AI adoption literature by highlighting the previously neglected interplay of enrichment and impairment effects that drive job satisfaction at varying levels of adoption. We also show that firm‐level strategies shape how employees perceive AI‐driven changes to their jobs and provide a nuanced view of how a job characteristics perspective can help organizational scholars and practitioners understand the multifaceted effects of AI on work environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a continuous-time model examining agency conflicts among controlling shareholders (managers), minority shareholders, and creditors in corporate investment decisions. The manager’s private benefits encourage overinvestment, while their equity stake and debt overhang lead to underinvestment. We show these offsetting incentive effects can achieve optimal investment timing under certain conditions. Agency costs exhibit U-shaped relationships with private benefits, tax rates, volatility, managerial ownership, and leverage. The model reveals how the interplay among agency conflicts, tax benefits, and bankruptcy costs shapes optimal ownership and capital structure, explaining several documented empirical patterns in corporate finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel data set of misconduct records for Finnish CEOs and directors and their parents, we explore whether corporate executives’ financial misconduct is associated with similar behavior by their parents. Controlling for various other factors of executive financial misconduct, we find that executives are significantly more likely to engage in financial misconduct, including accounting, tax, and other financial offenses, if their parents have a history of financial misconduct. This intergenerational association is stronger when the parental misconduct is more severe. Additional findings reveal that growing up in high‐misconduct municipalities and cohabiting with spouses who engage in financial misconduct are also associated with a higher likelihood of executive misconduct, indicating that such behaviors may be shaped by broader socialization processes that extend beyond the immediate family. Although our analyses do not establish causal relationships, the collective evidence presented in this study offers insights into why some corporate executives engage in misconduct while others do not.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on research on social class origin and cognitive concepts from the psychology literature, we propose that social class environment during childhood creates class-based cognitive imprints among individuals, leading to contextualist cognitive tendencies among lower-class individuals and solipsistic cognitive tendencies among upper-class individuals. We theorize that these class-based cognitive tendencies explain the prosocial behavior of individuals, such that the philanthropic orientation is greater among entrepreneurs of lower-class origin compared with those of upper-class origin. The philanthropic orientation among lower-class entrepreneurs is further amplified by imprints of education and political propaganda. These theoretical predictions received support considering entrepreneurs in Chinese private enterprises. Our study contributes to the literature on the social class origin concept from the social stratification theory, the psychology literature on cognitive perspectives, and imprinting theory.</content>

    <title>Is Blending Fintech With Traditional Finance a Top-Shelf Blend or a Sour Mix? Evidence From the Ownership of Equity Crowdfunding Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital finance platforms are disrupting traditional financial entities (FEs). Yet, FEs increasingly invest in their ownership. We investigate whether FE ownership creates a “top-shelf blend” that enhances platform performance or a “sour mix” that undermines it. We integrate legitimacy theory and organizational identity theory to theorize an invertedU-shaped relationship between FE ownership and the performance of equity crowdfunding (ECF) platforms. A longitudinal analysis based on 306 ECF platforms demonstrates that FE ownership enhances performance up to a certain point, after which performance declines. The legitimacy of FEs owning ECF platforms moderates this relationship.</content>

    <title>When should firms watch for cross‐industry competition? A demand‐side perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on competitor identification has primarily focused on intra‐industry competition. However, cross‐industry competitive threats are prevalent and consequential. We adopt a consumer‐oriented perspective to examine how consumer perceptions shape de facto competition across industry boundaries. Drawing from social cognition theories, we introduce two mechanisms—cultural embeddedness and social salience—that lead consumers to perceive products in an emerging industry as viable substitutes for those in an established industry, thereby intensifying competitive pressures on established firms. We further hypothesize that the impact of these mechanisms varies across heterogeneous customer groups, specifically with respect to income, education, and immigration status. Event history analyses of Illinois movie theater failures during television's rise in 1944–1962 support our theorizing.Managerial SummaryIdentifying competitors can be a complex managerial task. While it often suffices to monitor only within‐industry competitors, unexpected cross‐industry rivals selling seemingly different products can create competitive blind spots. To identify cross‐industry competitive threats, we propose a demand‐based view to complement managerial perceptions: Do your customers view your offerings as interchangeable with emerging products? We find that when an emerging industry's products embody cultural elements borrowed from the established industry's offerings or resonate better with public discourse, customers are likely to perceive substitutability and switch to the emerging products. However, this tendency varies among customers with different profiles, making it essential to recognize which customer segments are more vulnerable when facing cross‐industry competition.</content>

    <title>Lifecycle Wages and Human Capital Investments: Selection and Missing Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We derive wage equations with individual specific coefficients from a structural model of human capital investment over the life cycle. This model allows for interruptions in labour market participation and deals with missing data and attrition problems. We propose a new framework that deals with missingness at random and is based on factor decompositions that allow for flexible control of selection. Our approach leads to an interactive effect wage specification, which we estimate using long administrative panel data on male wages in the private sector in France. A structural function approach shows that interruptions negatively affect average wages. Interestingly, they also negatively affect the inter-decile range of wages after twenty years. This is only partly due to the fact that interruptions are endogenous.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: An Economic Analysis of Subscription Sharing of Digital Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Subscription sharing, where users share premium family plans with non-family members via platforms like TogetherPrice and Sharesub, has become increasingly common. This raises a key question: should providers still offer discounted family plans alongside individual ones? Our research explores this issue for a monopolistic provider facing this sharing threat. We analyze the optimal pricing strategy and the effects of subscription sharing on profits, plan offerings, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that offering both plans is at least as profitable as offering individual plans only, and sharing can sometimes supercharge profits. However, platform fees reduce these benefits by narrowing the price gap between plans, weakening the market expansion effect. Our numerical results show that sharing often improves social welfare. Overall, these insights suggest that subscription sharing is not always as harmful to providers, and the platform service fees play a key role in pricing strategies.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Incentivizing flexible workers in the gig economy: The Case of ride-hailing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand platforms like ride-sharing services rely heavily on economic incentives to attract, retain, and manage independent workers who have significant discretion over whether and where to work. Using an analytically tractable spatial model, we explore the impact of different pricing and commission strategies on customer demand, driver entry and retention, and their location choices. Our model yields several unique results and actionable insights. We find that flexible commission policies are more effective than fixed commission policies in allocating drivers efficiently across locations, reducing bottlenecks, and improving driver retention. We also show that commission-based interventions are more effective than price interventions in responding to labor market changes, as they directly affect driver incentives without distorting customer demand. Finally, if fairness-sensitive customers are prevalent in the market, then fixed pricing, combined with flexible commissions, becomes the optimal rule. Simulations based on actual ride patterns from New York City and Los Angeles confirm our insights.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Product Sharing: A Threat or an Opportunity for Competing Manufacturers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of product sharing on competing manufacturers under a platform's different quality entry barrier strategies. We build a game-theoretic analytical model to examine the strategies of two manufacturers: a high-quality manufacturer producing a high-quality product and a low-quality manufacturer producing a low-quality product. We explore three markets: the N-S market where the sharing market does not exist, the L-S market, and the H-S market, where the platform sets low and high entry barriers, respectively. We study these three markets because they bracket the most common platform entry policies in practice—no sharing, low-barrier (open access), and high-barrier (quality-gated) participation. Our findings indicate that while product sharing makes it easier for the high-quality manufacturer to survive, it may not necessarily improve the survival likelihood of the low-quality manufacturer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of the sharing market may negatively impact both manufacturers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate how competing manufacturers, platforms, and consumers can cope with the sharing phenomenon. We show that, while the high-quality manufacturer prefers a low cost of quality in all three markets, the low-quality manufacturer, interestingly, prefers a high cost of quality in both product-sharing markets. Additionally, we illustrate that the platform should not always set a low entry barrier to allow more product types to join. Surprisingly, our results show that although product sharing always benefits social welfare, it could potentially harm consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing prominence of live streaming has attracted the attention from both e-commerce practitioners and the research community. This paper investigates the impact of online retailers adopting live streaming technology in business operations on their product sales, dissecting dual roles of live streaming: information provision and customer relationship management. Leveraging multiple archival data sources, we combine econometrics with deep learning to analyze the nuanced, dual roles of live streaming in online retail. Specifically, we develop a novel deep learning framework to identify two types of live streaming strategies, product-oriented and non-product-oriented, and find that both strategies significantly increase online product sales. Notably, our research suggests that past review volume and product visual informativeness substitute the impact of using product-oriented live streaming; whereas seller’s rating and product visual informativeness complement the impact of using non-product-oriented live streaming. These results suggest that product-oriented live streaming increases sales by reducing product uncertainty via information provision, whereas non-product-oriented live streaming increases sales via non-information mechanisms, such as enhancing customer relationship management.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Using AI as Gatekeeper or Second Opinion: Designing Patient Pathways for AI-Augmented Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Of the 1,247 artificial intelligence (AI) systems cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as of May 2025, most function as classifiers to help screen or diagnose specific medical conditions. Yet, questions remain about how to best integrate AI into healthcare workflows, including whether AI should serve as a gatekeeper, determining which patients require human attention, or as a second opinion to complement medical consultations. Motivated by this question, we model a healthcare system in which patients can consult a specialist, an AI system, or both. The key design question is whether the patient should first consult AI or the specialist, corresponding to AI’s gatekeeper and second-opinion roles, respectively. We model a two-step decision-making process influenced by an initial signal, or anchor. Contrary to popular belief, we show using AI as a gatekeeper does not necessarily increase missed diagnoses; using AI as a second opinion, on the other hand, reduces missed diagnoses but can also increase false positives. In general, the gatekeeper approach is preferable in low-risk settings, whereas the second-opinion approach is better suited for high-risk patients for whom avoiding missed diagnoses is a primary concern. Notably, scenarios exists where AI shouldnotbe used for intermediate-risk patients for whom uncertainty is highest, challenging the premise that AI is most useful in reducing uncertainty. Finally, applying our model to glaucoma diagnosis, we numerically illustrate cost savings from optimizing patient pathways. Our work highlights the potential for AI to contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by optimizing resource allocation and improving patient outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employing unique data from 91 stocks trading on their primary exchanges and three alternative venues, we show that liquidity suppliers post duplicate limit orders on competing trading venues and cancel the duplicated orders immediately after one of them is filled. This is consistent with liquidity suppliers engaging in crossvenue market making. This duplicated-then-canceled liquidity is predominantly used by high-frequency traders when their inventories are not excessive. It reduces execution costs of fast traders on alternative venues. It, however, has some adverse impact on execution costs on primary exchanges, but those negative effects fail to outweigh the liquidity benefits of market fragmentation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grant ANR-15-CE33-0006] for funding the project and Centre pour la recherche économique et ses applications for granting additional research budget.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01789 .</content>

    <title>Platform Disintermediation with Repeated Transactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a setting in which a platform matches buyers and sellers, who then wish to transact with each other multiple times. The platform charges fees for hosting transactions but also offers convenience benefits. We consider two scenarios. In one scenario, all transactions must occur on the platform; in the other scenario, buyers and sellers can disintermediate the platform after the first transaction and do subsequent transactions offline. We find that the platform reacts to disintermediation by using a “front-loaded” pricing scheme, whereby it charges more for earlier transactions. We also show that sometimes the platform is better off when disintermediation is possible—because it can use disintermediation to screen users’ private information about their convenience benefits. Buyers are not necessarily better off when they can disintermediate due to the way in which the platform adjusts its fees.This paper was accepted by Greg Shaffer, marketing.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the most notable developments of the sharing economy is the unfettered proliferation of on-demand services. In this work, we examine how a subset of such platforms, online food delivery (e.g., Grubhub, UberEats, DoorDash), has affected the meal preparation and dining behaviors of American households. To do so, we exploit the phased entry of the platform Grubhub into U.S. counties from 2005 to 2019 using a difference-in-difference approach. Results indicate that the availability of such delivery services leads to a significant reduction in time spent preparing meals within the home, with no concomitant change in dining out. This effect is intensified in areas subject to greater demand and in areas with a greater number of restaurants but abates when less economically feasible (i.e., in areas with higher unemployment and households with more children). We also explore the association of Grubhub availability with subsequent changes in population body mass index. Implications for research, consumers, platforms, and public health are discussed.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02636 .</content>

    <title>Constructing New Product Development Portfolios with Internal and External Projects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In order to build a successful new product development (NPD) portfolio, a firm must ensure not only its access to a wide variety of candidate NPD projects but also its capacity to collect and verify vital information about these projects prior to project selection. In practice, a popular strategy to enrich the set of candidate projects is to contemplate investing in both internal and external NPD projects; however, this approach often interferes with the firm’s ability to evaluate its own projects reliably, which in turn results in subpar project selections. To meet this managerial challenge, the firm must carefully craft its project selection process and incentivize its project managers to evaluate projects thoroughly and share their honest evaluation of outcomes. We address these issues by developing a principal–multiagent model, and our findings yield direct managerial implications. First, we show that the relative importance of a firm’s NPD portfolio scope versus its project evaluation costs is what dictates how flexibly the firm should select between internal and external projects; of course, greater flexibility leads to broader portfolios but also to higher evaluation costs. Second, controlling the tension between internal and external NPD projects while ensuring effective project evaluation requires that the firm offers—in addition to individual performance incentives—shared incentives, which signal its project selection preferences and also limit project managers’ opportunities to extract rent.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03917 .</content>

    <title>Measurement for Dummies? Exploring the Role of Regulatory Metrics and Firm Strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most regulations are operationalized through metrics: numerical thresholds, targets, or test procedures that translate broad policy objectives into enforceable rules. Yet we know little about how these metrics shape firms’ strategic behavior. This paper aims to fill this gap by studying the introduction of the side impact dummy (SID) in U.S. automotive regulation, which established a regulatory metric based on the average male-sized body. Using detailed data on U.S. vehicular accidents, I find that the regulation led to large reductions in side-impact fatalities, but there were disproportionate benefits for occupants whose body sizes resembled SID. Furthermore this pattern is driven by heterogeneous firm behavior: Some firms delivered safety improvements across all occupants, whereas others focused narrowly on meeting the metric. This was moderated by two factors: firms’ strategic alignment with safety and their metric-based capabilities. Only firms with both dimensions were able to make broad improvements in line with policy objectives. These findings underscore the powerful role of regulatory metrics in channeling firm attention and effort. The ultimate impact of a regulation therefore depends not only on what policymakers measure but also which firms have the motivation and capabilities to act on them in a broad policy-consistent way.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01987 .</content>

    <title>Rational Choice Models: The Temporal Tree Representation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Choice models, which specify the consumers’ choice probabilities of options over a given choice set, are widely studied and applied in many fields. We propose a temporal tree representation of choice that covers all rational choice models. Compared with existing structural choice models, the tree representation exhibits two major advantages that address the key challenges of model identification. First, all rational choice models have a tree representation, and a subclass of tree representation (with set-dependent branching) has a one-to-one correspondence with the rational choice models. This bridges the gap in the existing characterizations of structural models, which are unidentifiable, impose uninterpretable conditions, or do not cover the entire space of rational choice models. Second, the tree representation allows for the flexibility of systematically specifying the choice model structure based on available knowledge and data. In particular, the number of parameters needed to specify a tree representation can be primarily determined by the sufficient knowledge level, which corresponds to a specific layer of the tree branching. The sufficient knowledge level can be empirically determined based on the amount of available data, which, in turn, determines the number of parameters needed for model estimation. Therefore, the tree representation allows for a natural way of data integration, avoiding misspecification from restrictive assumptions and overfitting for general models.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Assembling novel data sets on online advertiser spending, performance, and revenue, we quantify the economic effects of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy on e-commerce firms. We find that conversion-optimized Meta advertisements, affected most by ATT, saw a 37% reduction in click-through rates after ATT. Although firms responded by shifting ad spending from Meta to the Google ecosystem, firms with higher baseline Meta dependence nevertheless experienced a substantial decline in firm-wide revenue relative to firms with lower baseline Meta dependence. We quantify these effects using a variety of methods, finding revenue decreases in the range between 8% and 40% relative to less exposed firms. These declines were primarily borne by smaller e-commerce firms, raising questions about the tradeoffs between consumer privacy and the ability of smaller e-commerce and direct-to-consumer firms to succeed in the product market.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the LEC Program on Economics &amp; Privacy, MSI Research Grant [4001820].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06600 .</content>

    <title>Once a Conformist, Always a Conformist? Firms’ Discontinued Conformity to Global Sustainability Standards</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although scholars have established the importance of conformity to institutional pressures, limited research has examined the phenomenon of discontinued conformity, that is, when some firms withdraw from institutionalized practice after initial conformity. We propose that institutional immunity is a key mechanism by which firms enact such changes in response to institutional pressures. We identify ownership as the internal source of institutional immunity and interactions with external groups as the external sources. Institutional immunity filters institutional pressures and enables firms to withdraw after initial conformity. Using an event history analysis with 19,438 global observations concerning an institutionalized sustainability practice from 2012 to 2017, we find support for the proposed relationship between institutional immunity and discontinued conformity as well as the boundary condition of institutional quality. This study highlights organizational change away from conformity owing to the persistence of institutional contradictions and enriches our understanding of institutional immunity.</content>

    <title>The Asymmetry of Gender-Fluid Trends</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers and consumers are rapidly embracing gender-fluid products that fundamentally challenge the conventional associations of masculinity and femininity. In theory, manifestations of gender fluidity in the marketplace respond to shifting gender norms toward more inclusivity. Accordingly, consumers believe that the representation of traditionally male and female styles in these trends should be even. In contrast with these balanced views, this research demonstrates that gender-fluid trends to date skew toward traditionally male styles and that the corresponding adoption of gender-fluid products is driven relatively more by female and nonbinary consumers. Using a multimethod approach (including trend analyses of over 100,000 baby names, deep learning on a dataset of 200,000 products, and a series of experiments), this research defines gender fluidity in marketing, distinguishes it from related constructs such as gender-bending, unisex, and androgyny, and reveals a skewness in gender-fluid trends to date. It further demonstrates that women’s and nonbinary individuals’ heightened awareness of male advantages in society and lower fear of negative evaluation drive their greater adoption of gender-fluid styles.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We recover forward-looking expected net-of-fee abnormal returns (alphas) for active equity mutual funds from analyst ratings. In contrast to the typical equilibrium implication of zero alphas, analyst alphas are negative for most funds, but positive for the largest funds. We compare analysts’ subjective expectations with expectations from a rational expectations learning model. The model’s rational learner believes that an increase in fund size leads to a decrease in returns, but we find no evidence that analysts believe so. Consistently, counterfactual ratings based on the rational model tend to outperform analysts’ ratings out of sample. Investor fund flows respond significantly to analyst ratings.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Support from the Center for Big Data in Finance [Grant DNRF167], the Danish Finance Institute, and the Swedish House of Finance is gratefully acknowledged.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees routinely make valuable contributions at work that are not part of their formal job description, such as helping a struggling coworker. These contributions, termed organizational citizenship behavior, are studied from many angles in the organizational behavior literature. However, the degree to which the past helping behavior of employees scheduled to a shift impacts that shift’s operational outcomes remains an underexplored question. We define two measures of past helping behavior for members of a shift—the total past helping of each employee and the past helping between each pair of employees—and hypothesize that they are associated with shift performance. We empirically confirm our hypotheses with detailed scheduling and patient outcome data from six intensive care units (ICUs) at a large academic medical center, using the hospital’s electronic medical records to identify cases of one nurse helping another. Our empirical results indicate that both measures of past helping are predictive of patient length of stay (LOS), more so than the broadly studied notion of team familiarity. Counterfactual analysis shows that relatively small changes in shift composition can yield significant reduction in total LOS, indicating the managerial significance of the results. Overall, our study suggests the potential value of shift scheduling using data on past helping behaviors, and this may have promise far beyond the selected application to ICU nursing.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00465 .</content>

    <title>Inventing with Machines: Generative AI and the Evolving Landscape of IS Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not merely changing how information systems (IS) research gets done—it is reshaping what research can be. We stand at a pivotal moment where machines can help generate hypotheses, synthesize vast literatures, and identify patterns that would take human researchers months to uncover. Yet, this unprecedented capability presents equally unprecedented risks to scholarly integrity. Because the field is uniquely positioned to understand sociotechnical transformations, IS research faces an extraordinary opportunity to pioneer “inventing with machines” while preserving the human insight and oversight that gives scholarship, as currently defined, its meaning. This transformation demands more than tool adoption. It requires a reimagination of scholarly infrastructure, norms, and practice. However, this transformation of research tooling creates a dangerous paradox: Powerful AI tools are now accessible to researchers who lack the technical literacy to understand and use them responsibly, threatening everything from citation accuracy to theoretical validity. Yet within this paradox lies the potential for revolutionary advances in how we craft our future as scholars. Informed by the sociotechnical perspective, we argue that the path forward requires coordinated community action that goes far beyond individual skill development. The IS community must lead the development of specialized AI tools that consider our theoretical traditions, create educational frameworks that preserve scholarly values while embracing computational capabilities, and pioneer review processes that harness AI’s analytical power without ceding human control, at least, in the short run. Success will determine not only the future of IS scholarship but our field’s capacity to guide other disciplines through this fundamental transformation of academic practice. The era of human-AI collaboration in research has already begun. How we govern and guide it will define the next generation of scholarly discovery.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence, CEO Turnover, and Exploration Orientation in Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leadership transitions often create uncertainty in corporate innovation. Our study shows that artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in helping firms navigate these transitions. Using data on patents, job postings, and CEO turnover across U.S. public firms, we find that organizations with stronger AI investment are more successful in pursuing explorative innovation after CEO turnover. AI enables this shift by helping leaders overcome two common barriers: managerial myopia, the tendency to rely on familiar past practices, and information overload, which can overwhelm new executives. Firms that leverage AI more effectively reallocate resources to research and development, elevate innovation as a strategic priority, and launch new initiatives. These effects are especially pronounced in manufacturing industries and when CEOs have science, technology, engineering, and mathematics backgrounds. For practice, our findings highlight AI as a strategic capability that helps firms sustain organizational creativity during leadership change. For policy, they suggest that promoting AI adoption could strengthen innovation dynamism and competitiveness in rapidly changing environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The aging workforce demands evidence‐based human resource practices that lengthen working lives. Building on the Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll 1989), we investigate which organizational practices are indispensable for expanding older workers' occupational future time perspective (OFTP)—people's perceived opportunities and remaining time at work (Zacher and Frese 2009). A necessary condition analysis of survey data from 3077 workers aged 50+ in nine countries tests nine domains of the Later Life Workplace Index (LLWI) as potentialminimal viable practices. All domains exhibited statistically significant necessity effects; however, using the conventional threshold (Dul et al. 2023), only later life supportive leadership and adaptive work design reached the level consideredmeaningfully necessary. The remaining domains showed smaller, near necessity effects, suggesting a pattern of partial necessity across HRM practices. Exploratory analyses along the Tightness–Looseness cultural continuum suggested that necessity thresholds tended to be higher in culturally Tight than Loose societies, highlighting the importance of context‐sensitive HRM. This study refines theorizing on career sustainability, introduces necessity logic to the work and aging literature, and offers managers evidence‐based tools to prevent insurmountable shortcomings. Failure to meet the identified LLWI thresholds will typically result in suboptimal OFTP.</content>

    <title>Ch‐Ch‐Ch‐Ch‐Changes: The Impact of Supply Base Growth, Contraction, and Turnover on Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern supply chains are experiencing more disturbances due to regulatory shifts, rising sustainability standards, emerging or declining markets, and disruption to critical inputs. Some firms react by strengthening existing supplier partnerships to resist changes, while others reconfigure relationships with suppliers to embrace changes. Implicitly assuming structural changes are generally undesirable, research has traditionally supported the former approach to resist structural changes. However, the literature is not conclusive about the validity of this assumption. This study examines how supply base changes, captured as growth, contraction, and turnover, create opportunities and challenges for firm innovation. The results suggest that supply base growth positively impacts innovation performance, while supply base contraction has no significant statistical association. Supply base turnover has a nonlinear effect: it initially boosts innovation performance but negatively impacts it at high levels. This study contributes to theory by highlighting how supply base instability can bring innovation opportunities and risks to a firm. Specifically, supply base instability is broken down into distinct aspects, which are shown to affect firm innovation in distinctive manners. The findings not only urge supply managers to embrace supply base changes as an opportunity conducive to firm innovation but also caution against the disruptiveness of excessive changes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of a Horizontal Versus Vertical Product Display on the Attraction Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers can display their products horizontally or vertically in both online and offline settings. This display orientation has been shown to influence consumers’ judgments about individual products. The present research extends the literature by investigating the moderating impact of display orientation on the attraction effect, one of the most well-established context effects in choice. A total of eleven studies, including seven pre-registered experiments, document a novel finding that the attraction effect is stronger when choice alternatives are displayed horizontally rather than vertically. This moderating influence is replicated in both consequential choices and hypothetical scenarios and shown to generalize over diverse product categories. We explain this influence by proposing that a horizontal (vs. vertical) display increases the ease of comparing choice alternatives, leading consumers to notice the asymmetric dominance (AD) relationship among them more easily. Consistent with this mechanism, we find that the moderating influence of display orientation attenuates when individuals are guided to recognize the AD relationship or when their ability to compare vertically displayed products is momentarily enhanced. The present research thus demonstrates a significant effect of spatial orientation on the comparison and evaluation of alternatives. Theoretical and managerial implications of findings are discussed.</content>

    <title>Anthropomorphizing personal goals as dependent persons empowers consumer goal pursuit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Psychological empowerment plays a crucial role in motivating individuals to pursue their goals. This research explores a unique method to empower consumers in their goal pursuit: anthropomorphizing goals as dependent persons in need of care. Through three studies, including an incentive‐compatible study and a field study conducted at a hypermarket, we demonstrate that viewing personal goals as dependent persons who require care and nurturance (e.g., presenting a goal as a dependent person in a health app) can significantly enhance goal pursuit (e.g., choosing healthy snacks) by boosting psychological empowerment. We find that this motivational boost does not occur when a goal is simply anthropomorphized as any person (Study 1), when it is depicted as a dependent object (Study 1), or when it is anthropomorphized as an independent person (Study 2). This research contributes to a deeper understanding of motivation in goal pursuit and offers practical implications for marketers. Specifically, by using marketing communications to frame goals as entities that require care, marketers can help individuals foster a more engaging and empowering relationship with their aspirations.</content>

    <title>To wait, or not to wait: The paradoxical effects of time metaphors on impatience</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research explores the paradoxical effects of two different root metaphors of time—as resource and as motion—on impatience. We first show a conceptual correspondence between the two root metaphors: experiences associated with little time are often perceived as similar to those associated with time passing quickly, and experiences associated with ample time are often perceived as similar to those associated with time passing slowly. However, people's impatience exhibits opposite patterns for the corresponding metaphors: while people are less willing to wait when they have little versus ample time, they are more willing to wait when they experience time passing quickly versus slowly. This paradoxical effect arises because corresponding metaphors have opposite effects on perceived control and anticipated valence of the waiting time, which in turn lead to variations in impatience. Four studies (plus two in the Appendices S4 and S5) conducted across online, lab, and field settings support these findings. By identifying the relationship between the root metaphors of time‐as‐motion and time‐as‐resource and their paradoxical effects on impatience, this research contributes to the literatures on temporal cognition and intertemporal choice, and to the broader literature on the role of metaphors in consumer decision‐making.</content>

    <title>Trading with the enemy: A coopetitive perspective of resource exchange at arm's length</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on inter‐firm cooperation often focuses on long‐term strategic alliances while overlooking the distinct form of arm's‐length resource exchanges. Our study addresses this gap using the National Basketball Association (NBA) data for precise resource exchange measurements. Contrary to strategic alliances, where competitive pressure fosters cooperation, we find that competitive pressure reduces cooperation in arm's‐length exchanges. However, relational capital helps to facilitate resource exchanges. We also found that while resource bundling exacerbates the negative effect of competitive pressure, it amplifies the positive effect of relational capital. Interestingly, relational rivalry intensifies the impact of competitive pressure but does not diminish the effect of relational capital. These insights have important implications for the coopetition and the Strategic Factor Markets (SFM) literature.Managerial SummaryIn competitive environments, organizations may cooperate to reduce competition, often through long‐term strategic alliances. However, our research reveals different behaviors in arm's‐length resource exchanges. Analyzing NBA player transaction data, we found that competition generally discourages resource exchanges due to opportunism concerns, particularly when multiple resources are involved. Interestingly, organizations are more likely to engage in arm's‐length exchanges when key members have prior cooperative histories, especially in complex scenarios. Historical rivalries also heighten the competitive impact on resource exchanges but do not significantly diminish the benefits of prior cooperation. This study offers valuable insights for managers, helping them navigate resource exchange dynamics among competitors and make more informed strategic decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm births are key drivers of employment growth, productivity gains, and “creative destruction.” We show that setup costs create sizable financial constraints for new firms. When firms face high setup costs, they can only be established by leveraging up and lengthening debt maturity. We empirically confirm these predictions in a large sample of young French firms. Leverage is higher and debt maturity is longer in industries with high setup costs. Last, we show that following an exogenous shock that reduces banks’ supply of long-term loans, there is relatively lower firm creation in manufacturing industries with high setup costs.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Observatoire du financement des entreprises par le marché (OFEM) (NA) and Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grant F-STAR ANR-17-CE26-0007-01].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03846 .</content>

    <title>Assortment Optimization with α-Similar Substitutes: Insights from Customer Browsing Patterns</title>
    <updated>2025-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach to model assortment optimization problems based on two observations we made from customer browsing history on Taobao. First, most customers consider very few items (no more than five) before purchasing. Second, there exists a sorting of items so that most customer consideration sets are contained in small intervals in this sorting. This sorting can be discovered by the Cuthill-McKee algorithm, which is designed to work with sparse matrices. We encode these two observations into the [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property, which requires that all customers have consideration sets that lie in intervals (in the sorting) of length at most [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is a parameter we select and is fitted from data. The assortment optimization and pricing problems associated with this property are fixed-parameter tractable for a fixed [Formula: see text]. Moreover, we show that the assortment optimization for some specific choice model with [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property is polynomial-time solvable. We demonstrate our approach—going from data to modeling (i.e., selecting an appropriate [Formula: see text]) and finally to optimization—on another data set of customer click history on JD.com. Lastly, we conduct sensitivity tests on choice models that satisfy the [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property in the presence of customers with large consideration sets. We provide an approximation guarantee in terms of revenue when asserting the [Formula: see text]-similar substitutes property. Both theoretical and numerical results show that the optimal assortment of our estimated model captures most of the revenue even when there are customers with large consideration sets.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Funding: B.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study electric vehicle (EV) fleet and charging infrastructure planning in a spatial setting. For a centrally managed fleet that serves customer requests arriving continuously at a rate [Formula: see text] throughout the day, we determine the minimum number of vehicles and chargers for a target service level along with matching and charging policies. Whereas non-EV systems require extra [Formula: see text] vehicles because of pickup times, EV systems differ. Charging increases nominal capacity, enabling pickup time reductions and allowing for an extra fleet requirement of only [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text], depending on charging infrastructure and battery pack sizes. We propose the power-of-d dispatching policy, which achieves this performance by selecting the closest vehicle with the highest battery level from d options. We extend our results to accommodate time-varying demand patterns and discuss conditions for transitioning between EV and non-EV capacity planning. Simulations verify our scaling results, insights, and policy effectiveness. Whereas long-range, fast-charging fleets resemble non-EV systems, short-range, low-cost fleets can still perform competitively, underscoring the need for EV-aware management policies.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08524 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial company actions typically create favorable product evaluations. However, an emerging practice whereby companies employ individuals experiencing homelessness (i.e., “homelessness‐based impact hiring [IH]”) represents a meaningful exception. Five experiments show that consumers hold unfavorable perceptions of products from companies implementing homelessness‐based IH, despite moderately favorable moral judgments of the company, due to an unfavorable emotional response (i.e., disgust) activated by stigma‐driven contagion concerns. Experiment 1 demonstrates this phenomenon using actual choice behavior. Experiment 2 shows that the effect is specific to homelessness (vs. stigmatized groups in general) and is mediated by disgust. Experiment 3 replicates these effects using a non‐food product where contagion is relevant, while showing the effect attenuates when contagion is less relevant. Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrate how social proof may enhance the favorability of consumer response by targeting contagion concerns and therefore reducing disgust. Findings suggest that, despite consumer moral support, marketers cannot rely on halo effects from this emerging practice, while also providing theory‐driven guidance on overcoming obstacles to its implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Working remotely during the pandemic reshaped workplace culture. Many employers face pushback when implementing return‐to‐office (RTO) policies, primarily because the beliefs and expectations of employers and employees differ. This paper reviews the effects of RTO policies on various outcomes, including employee productivity, voluntary turnover, corporate culture, psychological safety, workplace civility, mental health and well‐being, and burnout incidence. Drawing on theory and research in these areas, it then proposes 10 best practices to support RTO transitions, such as framing the conversation, repairing the psychological contract, and developing RTO and communication strategies. To facilitate further improvements, the paper concludes with a framework comprising six focal areas related to RTO transitions, along with specific questions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between the gender composition of audit teams and two important audit outcomes—audit quality and audit fees. We identify gender composition across auditor ranks with novel audit-office level data for 20 large U.S. public accounting firms from 2010 to 2018. We find engagements of audit offices with more female auditors are associated with higher audit quality and lower audit fees. We find the association between gender composition and audit outcomes is strongest at the staff level, and among audit seniors in particular. The results also strengthen in offices with more supportive workplace environments. Overall, our large-scale evidence provides important insights on the role of gender composition of audit teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines the role of reward systems in enhancing cooperation, particularly when individual contributions are not fully transparent. We investigate the impact of reward mechanisms on cooperative behavior using an experimental setup known as the Voluntary Contribution Mechanism with Rewards. Our experimental design compares centralized reward (CR) systems, where an authority distributes rewards, with decentralized reward (DR) systems, where peers allocate rewards, against a no-reward baseline. The results reveal that CR generally promotes the highest level of cooperation, whereas DR achieves the greatest economic efficiency across all test environments. Participants also exhibited a strong preference for CR. These findings contribute to the existing literature by highlighting the effectiveness of reward systems in mitigating social dilemmas under conditions of imperfect information. The study offers vital insights for policymakers and organizational members in selecting incentive mechanisms that foster sustained collective action, even when individual efforts are not directly observable.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72503075 and 72203132]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [Grants 20AZD044, 22&amp;ZD150, and 24&amp;ZD084]; the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [Grants ZR2023QG096, ZR2023QG071, ZR2022MG068, and ZR2022QG048]; the Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province [Grant tsqn201909013 and tsqn202408212]; and the Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of Shandong University [Grant 21RWZD15] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06479 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We uncover a new price pattern: The stock systematic component exhibits momentum. This systematic momentum further yields a return momentum: Stocks sorted by systematic component have persistent positive returns. In comparison with the extremely popular and extensively studied momentum sorted by return, which is valid only monthly, our systematic return momentum holds intraday, daily, weekly, and monthly. Furthermore, our systematic momentum, the strongest ever discovered, is different from the factor momentum sorted by factor performance.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: S. Z.

    <title>Can Social Media Inform Corporate Decisions? Evidence from Merger Withdrawals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether social media sentiment predicts merger withdrawals. We find that a one‐standard‐deviation increase in social media sentiment after a merger announcement is associated with a 0.64 percentage point lower probability of withdrawal (16.6% of the average). This effect is unexplained by abnormal price reactions, traditional news, and analyst recommendations. Consistent with manager learning, the informativeness of social media strengthens after firms start corporate Twitter accounts. The informativeness is driven by longer acquisition‐related tweets by fundamental investors, rather than memes and price trend tweets. These findings suggest that social media signals can be important for corporate decisions.</content>

    <title>How Perceptual Disfluency Affects Consumer Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketing materials often create difficulties for consumers through elements like unconventional fonts or distracting background images, leading to perceptual disfluency—a sense of difficulty encoding information. During choices, consumers can mistake perceptual disfluency for choice difficulty, a feeling of indecision. Building on this idea, eleven preregistered experiments (N = 9,042) show that, when making choices, perceptual disfluency can lead consumers to rely on information that feels more intuitively appealing to them, such as a familiar brand, a preferred country of origin, or a recommendation, rather than on information they must carefully consider like numerical product specifications. Differing from the effect of perceptual disfluency in other situations, during choices, this effect occurs because consumers process information less deeply, engaging in relatively more intuitive and less analytical processing. This effect is amplified when consumers endorse a “fast-is-accurate” lay theory. In contrast, it does not occur when consumers do not mistake perceptual disfluency for choice difficulty, as when prompted to consider the actual reason for the disfluency, or when not making a choice.</content>

    <title>Extremeness Aversion and Choice Set Composition: Exposure to Multiple Extreme Options Reduces Extremeness Aversion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extremeness aversion—the tendency for consumers to prefer middling options in a choice set—is an incredibly robust and well-studied phenomenon. However, it has primarily been studied in the context of two or three option choice sets. In six studies (Ntotal = 9,377), we suggest consumers’ aversion to extreme options depends on the frequency of similar options in the choice set. In particular, we find that consumers are relatively more likely to choose an option that is in an extreme relative position when they are exposed to multiple extreme options, an effect not predicted by standard theories of context-dependent choice. This occurs because consumers perceive objectively extreme (vs. intermediate) options as relatively more typical of the product category. We demonstrate this effect is robust across different types of compositions, hypothetical and incentive-compatible studies, and in a variety of decision contexts (e.g., purchasing an item vs. choosing an activity to complete). Further, we identify boundary conditions, such as the type of occasion consumers are choosing for.</content>

    <title>The (Better) Road Not Taken: Setting a Goal Reduces Switching to More Effective Alternatives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;AbstractWe identify a novel way in which setting goals can backfire. In 13 studies and four supplemental studies, using both incentive-compatible and hypothetical designs across a range of domains, we demonstrate that setting an explicit goal and making progress towards it decreases the likelihood of switching to alternative means of pursuit. This occurs because means seem more effective relative to alternatives if they have been used to progress toward a reference point. Consistent with this mechanism, we show that the perceived effectiveness of the means used to pursue a goal, relative to an alternative, partially mediates the effect of setting a goal on the decision to switch means. Further, the effect occurs only after people make initial progress towards a specified reference point. Setting a goal does not decrease switching if people are reminded to consider the advantages of both the initial and alternative means. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.</content>

    <title>Pollution havens versus gates of hell: Environmental pollution and multinationals' foreign investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates an under‐explored cost of operating in pollution havens: thepollution‐induced operational cost, or the increased labor costs and material supply constraints resulting from host countries' environmental pollution. Environmental degradation can thus turn “pollution havens,” where lax compliance beckons institutional arbitrage and attracts investments from foreign firms, into “gates of hell,” where ecological damage heightens the costs for business operations and discourages foreign investments. We find evidence in a panel of US multinational corporations from 2007 to 2020. A firm's investment in a host country is decreasing in the host country's environmental pollution, especially if the firm faces heightened constraints in finding alternative labor inputs and material supplies or is highly dependent on these resources.Managerial SummaryOur findings offer practical insights for multinational corporate managers and policymakers. First, managers need to evaluate the opportunity of arbitrage against the cost of operation associated with environmental pollution, especially considering their firm's labor and material supply constraints. Second, policymakers should consider the price of relaxing environmental regulations to attract foreign investments. While weak environmental policies may spur investment from arbitraging firms into a (developing) country, unregulated destruction of the natural environment will inflict inevitable operational costs to destroy broader business opportunities, as the crucial resources (e.g., labor inputs and material supplies) become degraded by pollution.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Principal Reduction on Household Distress: Evidence from Mortgage Cramdown</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mortgage cramdown enabled bankruptcy judges to discharge the underwater portion of a mortgage in a chapter 13 bankruptcy until the Supreme Court disallowed this practice in 1993. We investigate the impact of mortgage cramdown on household distress exploiting the random assignment of cases to judges. The impact of bankruptcy protection on foreclosures is reduced by more than half after the Supreme Court disallowed cramdown. Our results suggest that large principal reductions considerably decrease homeowners’ distress by reducing debt overhang. (JEL D14, G21, G51, K35)</content>

    <title>Bank Debt, Mutual Fund Equity, and Swing Pricing in Liquidity Provision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Liquidity provision is often attributed to debt-issuing intermediaries like banks. We develop a unified theoretical framework and empirically show that mutual funds issuing demandable equity also provide an economically significant amount of liquidity by insuring against idiosyncratic liq uidity shocks. Quantitatively, bond funds provide 12.5% of the liquidity that banks provide per dollar. Our model further shows that when equity values incorporate the liquidation cost from re demptions, as in swing pricing, liquidity provision is not necessarily reduced. This is because swing pricing may increase funds’ capacity for holding illiquid assets without inducing panic runs. (JEL G01, G21, G23, G28)</content>

    <title>Designing Inclusive Offerings</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The trend toward inclusivity in product and service design—ensuring equal access to, or benefit from, products and services—has gained significant attention in industries such as beauty, wellness, and fashion. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no rigorous definition of inclusivity in the product line design or assortment optimization literature. This paper addresses the need for rigorous models, frameworks, and methods to create inclusive product lines and to measure the inclusivity of existing ones. We introduce the first formal definition of inclusive offerings and propose two continuous measures of inclusivity. We then formulate the inclusive offering design problem, which aims to select a minimum-cardinality set of offerings from a continuous feature space to ensure suitability for all users. Despite its NP-hardness, we present an optimal algorithm for realistic settings and one-dimensional feature spaces. Additionally, we explore the inclusivity resulting from offerings designed to maximize profit, revealing a nonmonotone relationship between inclusivity and the diversity of the user population. Our methods and metrics are applied to the foundation lines of eleven leading makeup brands, demonstrating their practical relevance and impact to the inclusive beauty movement.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, management science.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06742 .</content>

    <title>Redesigning VolunteerMatch’s Search Algorithm: Toward More Equitable Access to Volunteers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In collaboration with VolunteerMatch (VM)—the world’s largest online platform for connecting volunteers with volunteering opportunities—we designed and implemented a new display ranking algorithm. VM’s original ranking algorithm was intended to maximize efficiency (i.e., the total number of connections), but as a consequence, it repeatedly displayed the same few opportunities at the top of its ranking, effectively limiting access to volunteers for the other opportunities. To incorporate VM’s desire for equity (defined as the weekly number of opportunities with at least one connection) along with efficiency, we propose a modeling framework for online display ranking in settings where it is important to manage the trade-off between the total number of connections and the equitable allocation of these connections. We take an adversarial approach in evaluating the performance of online algorithms and show that a class of algorithms that applies a penalty to opportunities after each connection provides a strong (and, in certain regimes, optimal) performance guarantee. Inspired by our theoretical results yet mindful of practical considerations on VM’s platform, we propose SmartSort, a simple score-based ranking algorithm that enjoys comparable guarantees in many regimes. We implemented SmartSort in two experiments, covering Dallas–Fort Worth and all of Southern California. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the implementation of SmartSort led to an estimated 8% increase in the weekly average number of opportunities with at least one connection (consistent across both experiments) without any significant decrease in the total number of connections. If SmartSort has a similar distributional effect on a national scale, an additional 30,000 connections every year will go to opportunities that would have otherwise lacked access to volunteers.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03838 .</content>

    <title>Entrepreneurial Market Leadership Claims, Cultural Resonance, and Investor Evaluations in Nascent Markets: The Goldilocks Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cultural entrepreneurship research emphasizes entrepreneurs’ use of cultural resources to influence audience evaluations through resonance. However, the process by which such cultural resonance is achieved remains underexplored, particularly as an intermediary outcome. We investigate how cultural resonance may be attained by focusing on entrepreneurs’ use of a prevalent cultural resource in nascent markets: market leadership claims. Incorporating insights from social psychological research, we propose that the frequency of these claims becomes an important prompt in triggering investors’ cognitive processing and affects the attainment of cultural resonance. Specifically, we theorize a ‘Goldilocks effect’: a venture’s increased claiming frequency initially enhances resonance with investors, resulting in more favourable evaluations, but excessive claims reduce it, resulting in less favourable evaluations. Using a multimethod approach comprising an archival study and an experiment, we find support for our theory. These findings offer new insights into research on cultural entrepreneurship, discursive strategy, and nascent market strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using administrative data from the US Census Bureau, we introduce a new public‐use dataset (“Business Dynamics Statistics—High Growth” [BDS‐HG]) that captures the full distribution of firm growth in the United States between 1978 and 2021. BDS‐HG enables researchers to analyze not only high‐growth firms but also stagnant and shrinking firms, disaggregated by firm maturity, size, industry, region, and year. We begin by documenting two key trends: (1) a significant decline in the share of high‐growth firms—especially among young and small firms and (2) a marked rise in stagnant firms. To help illustrate the dataset's usefulness, we provide three empirical applications and highlight research opportunities across major areas of strategic management. In addition to supporting new analyses, BDS‐HG can be used to benchmark research samples and assess their generalizability.Managerial SummaryThe US economy has seen two major shifts in firm growth dynamics: a steady decline in the share of high‐growth firms—especially among startups—and a notable rise in firms that exhibit no growth. We document these patterns using BDS‐HG, a new public‐use dataset from the US Census Bureau that tracks employment growth across all US employer businesses from 1978 to 2021. The data are disaggregated by firm age, size, industry, geography, and year, enabling users to examine growth trends across sectors and regions. BDS‐HG offers a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and analysts seeking to understand long‐term business dynamism. It can also be used to benchmark research samples against national patterns, helping users assess how representative their data or findings are.</content>

    <title>All Along the Watchtower: Military Landholders and Serfdom Consolidation in Early Modern Russia</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines the emergence of coercive labor institutions using the case of serfdom in early modern Russia. We argue that serfdom consolidated under the pressure of landholding military elites who gained political influence due to the prolonged struggle with steppe nomads. To contain nomadic raids, the Russian state erected defense lines on the southern frontier, and granted land in the area to soldiers in charge of its defense. The soldiers could not farm while on defense duty, nor could they compete in the market for peasant labor, as the land had been selected for its defensive rather than agricultural value. The system was therefore only sustainable by restricting labor mobility. In response to the volume of landholders’ collective petitions, the Russian state gradually tied peasants to the land and institutionalized serfdom in the written law. Using newly digitized population data from the 17th century, we show a higher prevalence of serfs and military landholders in districts on the defense line. We also find a higher prevalence of small estates – up to 25 serf households – sufficient to support a soldier and his family. Placebo tests show that these patterns do not hold for non-serf peasants, or for merchants and artisans. To ensure causality, we develop a novel algorithm that reconstructs the optimal invasion routes for nomads and pinpoints the optimal location of the defense line using topographic data. Our results highlight the primacy of political economy factors over purely economic ones, such as the land-labor ratio or the grain trade, in the development of serfdom. This sheds new light on the possible mechanisms of institutional divergence between Eastern and Western Europe in the early modern period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do startups influence the neighborhoods in which they locate? Using data from the Greater London area, we find a positive association between growth-oriented entrepreneurship and both demographic and organizational changes in these communities. Older, less educated residents are replaced by younger, more educated ones. Restaurants become more expensive and more diverse. We also demonstrate that growth-oriented entrepreneurship predicts a subsequent rise in residential real estate prices. This price appreciation, however, does not seem to benefit long-term residents, as property values increase primarily in areas with high rates of renting. The gentrification of neighborhoods experiencing startup entry calls for deeper reflection on the role of entrepreneurship in inequality and the sustainability of entrepreneurial ecosystems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18920 .</content>

    <title>On the Convergence of Modified Policy Iteration in Risk-Sensitive Exponential Cost Markov Decision Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Balancing Risk and Robustness in Dynamic Decision MakingMany real systems, such as networks, finance, and safety-critical autonomy, must hedge against rare but costly events. Risk-sensitive control formalizes this idea by optimizing an exponential cost objective that prioritizes reliability over just average performance. Classical dynamic programming methods such as value iteration and policy iteration are well-understood in this risk-sensitive setting. However, modified policy iteration (MPI), which combines the strengths of both through partial policy evaluation, has lacked any theoretical understanding. This paper addresses this gap. It analyzes MPI for risk-sensitive Markov decision processes governed by a multiplicative Bellman equation, develops normalization and contraction tools suited to this setting, and proves both convergence and finite-time guarantees. The results provide a principled foundation for algorithms that combine computational efficiency with robustness, supporting the development of reinforcement learning methods that emphasize long-term reliability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing Police Presence to Prevent Crime Before It HappensIn their paper “Proactive Policing: Resource Allocation for Crime Prevention with Deterrence Effect,” He, Li, and Zhao introduce a novel optimization framework that reimagines how police resources should be allocated to prevent crimes rather than react to them. Departing from traditional models that respond after incidents occur, the authors propose a proactive approach grounded in the economics of deterrence effect and rational choice theory. By modeling offenders’ location choices using a multinomial logit framework, the study captures how visible police presence not only suppresses crime locally but also redistributes potential criminal activity across space, a phenomenon known as crime displacement and diffusion of crime control. The authors establish the computational complexity of the problem, develop tractable mixed-integer conic reformulations, and extend the framework to dynamic settings. A data-driven case study in New York City demonstrates the model’s potential to guide smarter, prevention-focused deployment of urban policing resources.</content>

    <title>Political Polarization and Nonmarket Strategy over the Policy Life Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Growing political polarization has reshaped the business landscape, shifting the mix of private and public politics companies face and requiring managers to develop more sophisticated nonmarket strategies. Yet the literature has largely continued to study strategies aimed at public and private politics in isolation. We analyze repertoires of nonmarket strategies and how they evolve over time in a formal game theoretic model of the policy life cycle, providing an integrated framework for studying public and private politics. Industry may resist activist campaigns or concede to them and may also lobby to block legislation when public politics is viable. The evolution of public opinion in a polarized world divides the game into two distinct phases, an initial phase of pure private politics and a subsequent phase with both public and private politics. Polarization delays social consensus and intensifies activism while increasing industry resistance to it. As public concern about an issue rises over time, industry resistance to activist campaigns weakens, and lobbying becomes costlier and less likely. We reveal important complementarities between strategies: The ability to lobby in the latter phase makes industry more resistant to activist campaigns during both phases of the life cycle. Our analysis demonstrates clearly and precisely how suboptimal strategic decisions may result from a failure to fully coordinate nonmarket strategy instruments.This paper was accepted by Anita McGahan, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.00819 .</content>

    <title>Augmented Learning for Joint Creativity in Human-GenAI Co-Creation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has opened new opportunities for human–GenAI co-creation, in which humans and GenAI collaborate to produce creative outcomes. However, our findings indicate that mere integration does not guarantee augmented learning—the foundation for the continuous improvement of joint creativity over time. Effective integration depends on how well humans understand and collaborate with GenAI. We propose a two-step approach. First, organizations should critically assess GenAI’s strengths and limitations, recognizing its capacity to analyze data and generate diverse ideas, but also its lack of contextual and emotional understanding. Second, organizations should design targeted strategies and training programs that cultivate employees’ skills in Idea Co-Development—a co-creation activity in which humans and GenAI engage in critical feedback exchanges and the joint refinement of generated ideas. Our study demonstrates that even basic explanations and examples of Idea Co-Development significantly enhance joint creativity, suggesting that formal training with contextualized exercises can further amplify results. From a policy and design perspective, GenAI developers should build systems that actively support co-creative interaction through features such as feedback loops and prompts for elaboration. Together, these organizational and technological initiatives can foster more effective, sustained, and creative human-GenAI collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A salient trend in crisis intervention has emerged in recent decades: government and central banks have offered funding directly to nonfinancial firms, bypassing banks and other credit intermediaries. We analyze the long-term consequences of such policies by focusing on firm quality dynamics. In a laissez-faire economy, firms with high productivity are more likely to survive crises than those with low productivity. The government funding support saves more firms but cannot be customized based on firm productivity, dampening the cleansing effect of crises. The policy distortion is self-perpetuating: a downward bias in the firm quality distribution necessitates larger interventions in future crises. Our mechanism is quantitatively important: we show that if policymakers ignore such distortionary effects on firm quality dynamics, the resultant credit intervention would almost double the optimal amount.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial performance is often right-skewed and heavy-tailed, yet empirical studies typically focus on average outcomes, assuming normality. Recent research addresses this by examining full performance distributions. We extend this work by introducing an intuitive framework with three distinct characteristics of distributional tails: (a) tail impact, the contribution of star performers relative to the rest; (b) tail extremity, the extent by which the highest performer exceeds the typical performer; and (c) tail frequency, the fraction of performers who are stars. We outline a methodological guide, offer illustrative examples, and provide R code to enrich future investigations of star performance in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Chatting Towards Inclusivity: A Digital Approach to Inclusion Action Plans and Leader Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inclusion is a cornerstone of success for organizations and society, yet inclusion is not guaranteed. Building on inclusive leadership research and relational models theory, we argue that inclusion cannot manifest without systematic effort and planning by leaders. Unfortunately, few resources exist to help leaders plan and enact specific inclusion behaviors. To address this, we introduce the “Leader Success Bot,” an innovative conversational chatbot designed to help leaders develop daily inclusion action plans. Through our immersive longitudinal design and mixed methods data, we advance the taxonomy of inclusive leader behaviors and test the impact of inclusion planning on leaders and followers. We demonstrate how equality matching is an overlooked relational model that is a pivotal relational dynamic for inclusion. Across two studies, our quantitative and qualitative findings show that equitable exchanges by leaders can foster a deeper sense of belonging and community. As leaders interact with the chatbot, both leaders and followers are more likely to accomplish their goals. Additionally, followers' inclusion climate and psychological safety benefited, leading to a decrease in turnover intentions. Our findings underscore the potential of chatbots to support inclusive leadership training and development by providing leaders with a structured, scalable platform for continuous reflection and growth. This research advances theoretical understanding of relational inclusion dynamics and offers practical insights and a scalable tool for HR managers seeking to build more inclusive, psychologically safe cultures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies using archival organizational structure data are not as prevalent as one might expect for such a critical strategy topic. We seek to facilitate more studies in this domain by introducing a novel, hand‐collected dataset of top management team compositions of S&amp;P 500 firms between 1993 and 2020. Alongside providing the original role titles, we use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to categorize executives' titles into 6 role groups and 12 hierarchical levels, enabling easier comparisons of structures across and within firms. Our findings not only align with prior research but also offer insights into industry‐specific structural changes, functional distributions within organizations, and the evolution of executive roles. This work also highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool to empirically investigate key strategy questions.Managerial SummaryOne of the most important decisions senior managers make pertains to defining their firms' organizational structures. However, obtaining data on firms' structures can be challenging due to difficulties in accessing data and comparing structures across firms. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset of top management team compositions of S&amp;P 500 firms between 1993 and 2020. Alongside providing the original names and job titles, we use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to categorize executives' titles into 6 role groups and 12 hierarchical levels, allowing easier comparisons of structures across and within firms. We hope that this new dataset will spur greater scholarly interest in organizational structure, offering insights into how firms are structured and the implications of these structures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how portfolio regulations affect risk sharing between financial institutions with market power. Unconstrained access to complete markets permits flexible exploitation of market power and induces inefficient risk sharing. Appropriate portfolio restrictions counteract this, improving liquidity and risk sharing by bundling securities with offsetting strategic incentives. However, excessive regulation can be counterproductive, destroying gains from trade. An application of our theory shows that cross-asset spillovers are critical for policy evaluation: in general equilibrium, risk sharing can improve even if certain asset-specific liquidity measures deteriorate. We also discuss the effects of asymmetric regulation for different institutions.</content>

    <title>Treasury Reuse and the Demand for Safe Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We theoretically and empirically show how the reuse of Treasury securities as collateral alleviates safe asset scarcity. Our model characterizes how reuse allows intermediaries to efficiently reallocate the safety benefits of long-term Treasury securities to a broader investor base. By reusing Treasury securities, intermediaries can access more collateral to create safe assets without interest rate risk. When the demand for safe assets is high, intermediaries increase reuse, distributing safe asset benefits to investors that value safety the most. Using supervisory data to calculate a dealer-level measure of reuse called the “collateral multiplier,” we empirically confirm the model’s main predictions.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint, so that the re-solving technique is applied to alinear programwith additional slack variables amenable to practical computations and theoretical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Unraveling the Transformative Effects of Online Healthcare Consultation Services on Outpatient and Inpatient Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online healthcare consultation services (OHCS) hold immense potential to transform the healthcare industry. This study seeks to investigate the impact of doctors' participation in OHCS on offline outpatient and inpatient costs, addressing a critical yet underexplored area in the healthcare IT literature. Utilizing an exhaustive dataset from a high-level comprehensive hospital in China over a period of 42 months, we find that doctors' OHCS participation increases outpatient costs by 63.2% (¥268.510) and inpatient costs by 22.2% (¥2,365.092). These results remain robust after addressing endogeneity concerns through instrumental variable (IV) approaches and propensity score matching (PSM). Notably, mechanism tests reveal that OHCS participation enhances doctors' service volume expansion, cost-upgrading within services and patient mix changes, leading to induced demand and higher offline medical costs. Moreover, these effects are amplified for doctors with higher professional status. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and higher department crowding levels tend to mitigate these cost increases. This study makes several significant theoretical contributions. First, it expands the healthcare IT literature by uncovering the "dark side" of OHCS participation, showing that it raises medical costs by altering supply-demand dynamics, contrary to the cost-saving potential often associated with traditional healthcare IT. Second, it advances research on OHCS by identifying the mechanisms—service volume expansion, cost-upgrading within services and patient mix changes—through which OHCS participation influences offline costs. Third, it explores the heterogeneous effects of physician, environmental, and departmental characteristics on medical costs. Practically, our findings suggest that hospitals and policymakers should promote widespread OHCS participation to balance supply-demand dynamics, advance treatment standardization and differentiated payment models, establish a multi-dimensional physician performance evaluation system, and leverage AI technology to improve doctor-patient matching and resource scheduling—enabling the realization of online healthcare's potential without inadvertently driving up medical costs. This study highlights the nuanced implications of OHCS on offline healthcare costs, offering insights for improving its implementation in healthcare systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Time intervals can be framed either by a calendar year (e.g., “2015”) or by length (e.g., “10 years”), yet these ostensibly equivalent formats lead to systematically different judgments. Combining data from whiskey auctions with seven controlled experiments, we demonstrate that length framing elongates time perception compared to year framing, which we refer to as the year–length effect. As a result of changes in time perception, length framing increases the importance of time-related attributes in choice, leading to more favorable product evaluations in contexts where age enhances product value (e.g., whiskey evaluation) and to more negative evaluations in contexts where age reduces it (e.g., used goods). Process evidence implicates the logarithmic mental number line: years with large nominal values occupy a compressed region of the line, relative to small length numerals. These findings offer practical guidance on how time framing can be used to shape time perception and customer value.</content>

    <title>The Role of Status Incongruence in Employee Responses to Participative Leadership</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has focused on the negative effect of status incongruence, this paper offers an optimistic perspective as it relates to participative leadership. Status incongruence refers to a situation in which status characteristics of the supervisor and the subordinate are opposite to standard norms. Leaders who are younger, less educated, less experienced, or shorter tenured than their followers are status incongruent. Incorporating role congruity theory with the participative leadership literature, we argue that participative leaders in status incongruence will be able to boost subordinate affective commitment and organizational citizenship behaviors more than their counterparts with lower status incongruence. We further propose a moderated mediation model whereby the positive indirect relationship between participative leadership and subordinate organizational citizenship behaviors through affective commitment will be stronger for status incongruent dyads. By finding support for our hypotheses across two field studies, this work suggests role congruity theory to consider leadership style as well as multiple status indicators together in understanding how role (in)congruity arises for leaders with varying levels of status incongruence. Suggestions for how human resource (HR) managers should consider leadership style as part of their HR strategy for fostering participative workplaces are offered.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using field and laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that the complexity of incentive schemes and worker bounded rationality can affect effort provision. This is because some attributes of the incentives become opaque; that is, workers do not take them into account. In our setting, workers overprovide effort relative to a fully rational benchmark, improving efficiency. We identify contract features, and facets of worker cognitive ability, that matter for opacity. We find that even relatively small degrees of opacity can cause large shifts in behavior. Our results illustrate important implications of complexity and bounded rationality for designing and regulating workplace incentive contracts. (JEL C90, D21, D91, J22, J31, J41)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider an economy with equal amounts of N types of goods, to be allocated to agents with strict quasi-convex preferences over lotteries. We show that ex ante, all Pareto-efficient allocations give almost all agents lotteries over at most two outcomes. Our results provide a simple criterion showing that many popular allocation mechanisms are ex ante inefficient. For the case of identical preferences, we establish existence of an efficient solution where all lotteries used are equally attractive. Assuming the reduction axiom, social welfare deteriorates by first randomizing over these binary lotteries. Efficient ex ante equality is achieved if agents satisfy the compound-independence axiom.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the firm responses and real wage effects of foreign demand shocks. We use Belgian microdata to construct firm-specific measures of demand shocks, which capture that firms pass on foreign demand shocks to domestic suppliers. Our estimates of firm responses to these shocks suggest that firms face upward-sloping labor supply curves and have sizable fixed labor costs. We specify a general equilibrium model with these features to quantify the aggregate effects of simulated tariff shocks on wages. We find that ignoring fixed labor costs substantially underestimates aggregate effects on wages, whereas incorporating upward-sloping labor supply appears less consequential.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on data gathered from 27,000 real-world meetings between financial advisors and clients of a large German bank, we show that advisors offer more self-serving advice to women, while men are more likely to receive sales fee rebates and less likely to be recommended expensive in-house multi-asset (IHMA) funds. Additional client and advisor surveys provide evidence consistent with statistical discrimination based on gender as a proxy for client financial sophistication, with female clients exhibiting lower financial literacy, confidence, and price sensitivity. Moreover, female advisors report less confidence in their own professional skills and engage in less discrimination than male colleagues. (JEL D83, G21, G51, G53, J16, L84)</content>

    <title>Supply, Demand, Institutions, and Firms: A Theory of Labor Market Sorting and the Wage Distribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how workforce composition, labor demand, and minimum wage jointly determine wages through their effects on worker-task assignments, firm wage premiums, and firm-worker sorting. Using an estimated model of monopsonistic local labor markets, it finds that minimum wage hikes and labor demand shocks drove the decline in Brazilian wage inequality from 1998 to 2012. While rising educational attainment compressed skill premiums within firms, it also reallocated skilled workers to high-wage firms, limiting that shock’s effect on inequality. The analysis highlights interactions among exogenous factors, showing that concurrent supply and demand changes attenuated minimum wage impacts. (JEL J22, J23, J24, J31, J38, J42, R23)</content>

    <title>Downward Rigidity in the Wage for New Hires</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wage rigidity is an important explanation for unemployment fluctuations. In benchmark models wages for new hires are key, but there is limited evidence on this margin. We use wages posted on vacancies, with job and establishment information, to measure the wage for new hires. We show that our measure of the wage for new hires is rigid downward and flexible upward, in two steps. First, wages change infrequently at the job level, and fall especially rarely. Second, wages do not respond to rises in unemployment, but respond strongly to falls in unemployment. Job information is crucial for detecting downward rigidity.

    <title>A Goldilocks Theory of Fiscal Deficits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable framework for deficit and debt dynamics. A “free lunch” fiscal deficit—one that raises spending without higher future taxes—is sustainable without zero lower bound (ZLB) only when R &lt; G − φ, where φ is the sensitivity of the interest rate to the debt level. With the ZLB, both high and low deficits can increase debt, as the latter weaken demand and reduce nominal growth at the ZLB. A rise in income inequality expands fiscal space outside the ZLB, but contracts it at the ZLB. Calibrating the model, we find little space for “free lunch” policies for the United States in 2019, but significant space for Japan. (JEL D31, E23, E43, E62, H62, H63)</content>

    <title>First-Generation Elite: The Role of School Social Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;High school students from non-elite backgrounds are less likely to have peers with elite-educated parents than their elite counterparts. This difference in social capital is a key driver of the high intergenerational persistence in elite education. We identify a positive elite peer effect on enrollment in elite programs and labor market earnings, then disentangle underlying mechanisms. Exploiting a lottery in assessment, a causal mediation analysis shows the overall positive peer effect reflects a positive effect on application behavior (conditional on GPA). When considering income mobility, we find that further mixing between high school elite and non-elite students could improve mobility. (JEL D31, I21, I23, I24, J31, J62, Z13)</content>

    <title>Changing Income Risk across the US Skill Distribution: Evidence from a Generalized Kalman Filter</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For whom has earnings risk changed, and why? We answer these questions by combining the Kalman filter and EM algorithm to estimate persistent and temporary earnings for every individual at every point in time. We apply our method to administrative earnings linked with survey data. We show that since the 1980s, persistent earnings risk rose by 12.5 percent for both employed and unemployed workers and the scarring effects of unemployment doubled. At the same time, temporary earnings risk declined. Using education and occupation codes, we show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. (JEL J22, J24, J31, J64)</content>

    <title>When Product Markets Become Collective Traps: The Case of Social Media</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals might experience negative utility from not consuming a popular product. With such externalities to nonusers, standard consumer surplus measures, which take aggregate consumption as given, fail to appropriately capture consumer welfare. We propose an approach to account for these externalities and apply it to estimate consumer welfare from two social media platforms: TikTok and Instagram. Incentivized experiments with college students indicate positive welfare based on the standard measure but negative welfare when accounting for these nonuser externalities. Our findings high-light the existence of product market traps, where active users of a platform prefer it not to exist. (JEL D62, D83, D91, L82, Z13)</content>

    <title>An Equilibrium Analysis of the Effects of Neighborhood-Based Interventions on Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies housing vouchers and urban redevelopment programs by incorporating neighborhood effects into a general equilibrium overlapping-generations model with endogenous location choice and child development. We calibrate the model using US data and estimate impacts of large-scale implementations of rental voucher and place-based subsidy policies. Our core finding is that vouchers generate long-run welfare gains by reducing inequality and generating skill improvements that offset higher taxation and other GE effects. Although vouchers lead to larger welfare gains on average, we find housing supply. (JEL D63, H24, J13, J24, R23, R31, R38)</content>

    <title>Strategic Voting in Two-Party Legislative Elections</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study multidistrict legislative elections with two parties and two binary dimensions of policy. Strategic voters focus on the dimension where their district is most likely to be pivotal in the legislature. Anticipating this, candidates select different policies than they would in single-district elections. The final policy is (i) uniquely pinned down by voter preferences, (ii) preferred by a majority of districts on each dimension, and (iii) a Condorcet winner if one exists. These properties are not guaranteed in single-district elections. (JEL D71, D72, D81, D91)</content>
