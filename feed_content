    <title>Cooperation and punishment in managing social performance: Labor standards in the Gap Inc. supply chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate social performance depends not only on a firm's behavior but also on the behavior of its suppliers. What management strategies improve the social performance of suppliers? Scholarship on inter‐firm relations and regulatory governance debates the efficacy of threatening to penalize suppliers, compared with more cooperative approaches. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effects of typical actions to manage supplier social performance, both with and without threatened penalties. Suppliers improved social performance—increasing their probability of passing labor audits by 22 percentage points—only when regulatory actions included a threatened penalty: to discontinue business. Suppliers improved most in response to threatened penalties when they faced higher levels of supply chain competition or were engaged in longer‐term commercial relationships with the buyer.Managerial SummaryHow can multinationals improve labor standards in their suppliers around the world? We compared two approaches at the clothing retailer Gap Inc. When Gap did not threaten to discontinue business with low‐performing suppliers, we found no improvement in labor compliance when Gap issued failing compliance grades. However, once Gap began threatening to discontinue business with its lowest‐compliance suppliers, failing suppliers showed marked improvement in labor compliance. Failing suppliers improved most when (a) they faced high competition within their product category, and (b) when they were in longer‐term commercial relationships with the buyer. Our findings suggest buyers should use a combination of both threats and cooperation with suppliers to improve labor standards in global supply chains.</content>

    <title>From margins to mainstream: The narrative dilemma in scaling social ventures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As social ventures expand beyond their original marginalized customers, they face demand‐side limitations to scale. This study examines how a common tool for managing strategic change – origin stories – affects non‐marginalized customers’ responses. In a survey‐based field experiment with an Indian feminine hygiene company that initially served rural customers but now targets urban customers, we found that telling origin stories reduced urban customers’ purchase intentions compared to not telling them. This result appears driven by stigma transfer: non‐marginalized customers avoided stigma by not purchasing products associated with stigmatized groups. However, when framed around social responsibility, the origin story increased non‐purchase support (e.g., joining the mailing list). Because it remains unclear whether the increased support is temporary or sustained, social ventures must weigh such gains against potential declines in purchases as they scale.Managerial summaryHow can social ventures expand beyond marginalized communities? A survey‐based field experiment with an Indian feminine hygiene company reveals that sharing its origin story with urban, non‐marginalized customers reduced purchase intentions. This response was likely due to stigma transfer, where urban customers avoided stigma by distancing themselves from products associated with rural users. However, framing the story around social responsibility increased mailing list subscriptions. An important takeaway for social ventures is that origin stories about marginalized customers may deter mainstream purchases. Since it remains unclear whether non‐purchase engagement reflects symbolic action or sustained interest, social ventures must weigh whether the potential gains meaningfully offset purchase losses when telling origin stories to new customers.</content>

    <title>Does U.S. Immigration Policy Facilitate Financial Misconduct?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether U.S. immigration policy, specifically the H‐1B visa program, affects the likelihood of financial misconduct. We argue that employers have leverage over employees on H‐1B visas because such employees must maintain H‐1B–eligible employment to legally reside in the United States. We posit that companies relying on H‐1B visas to hire workers in accounting roles have an increased ability to misreport their financial statements due to the greater costs H‐1B employees face if they are unexpectedly fired for not following the demands of their bosses or for blowing the whistle on misconduct. Using the sharp reduction in the H‐1B visa cap in 2004 as a shock to such employment, we find that companies that relied on this visa program for accounting roles pre‐shock experience a 2.3 percentage point decline in accounting irregularities post‐shock. Cross‐sectional tests show that the reduction in irregularities is greater in companies where H‐1B employees have (1) a greater influence on financial reporting or (2) fewer job opportunities. In addition, the relation between H‐1B visa use and irregularities is stronger in companies whose investors are more focused on near‐term earnings targets. We corroborate our findings using the outcome of H‐1B visa lotteries as shocks to such employment.</content>

    <title>Is Prior Failure a Burden for Entrepreneurs’ Follow-Up Crowdfunding Success?: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is prior failure a burden for entrepreneurs’ subsequent crowdfunding success? Prior research is equivocal with some suggesting failure offers a valuable learning experience, whereas others suggest failure indicates that entrepreneurs lack the competencies to be successful. To provide clarity, we draw on expectancy violations theory and delve into the influence of gender. We find that as the magnitude of failure increases, entrepreneurs’ likelihood of subsequent crowdfunding success decreases. However, this baseline relationship is moderated by the valence crowdfunders have toward entrepreneurs. We find that women entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs that failed in gender-incongruent categories are more likely to secure subsequent crowdfunding.</content>

    <title>Knightian Uncertainty in Entrepreneurship Research: Retrospect and Prospect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Knightian uncertainty (KU) has been central to entrepreneurship research for over half a century, there remains a lack of consensus on how to define, apply, and learn from the concept. We argue that, despite the apparent fragmentation of views and theories, there has been significant and valuable knowledge accumulation around KU that can inform entrepreneurship research. Reviewing 238 articles published over the past 60 years across seven disciplines, we find that (1) there is considerable congruity in how KU is discussed within, but not across, disciplines and at micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis; (2) cross-fertilization and integration of interdisciplinary insights exist but are insufficiently explored by entrepreneurship researchers; (3) progress in understanding and analyzing uncertainty may come primarily from multi-level, interdisciplinary analysis; and (4) entrepreneurship researchers may benefit from engaging the definitions and theories of uncertainty from neighboring fields like economics and decision science. We suggest a variety of research questions to unite different disciplines across levels of analysis to create a more integrated research agenda for KU in entrepreneurship studies.</content>

    <title>Low profile, high impact: How the visibility of political agents shapes corporate political influence</title>
    <updated>2025-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how corporate political influence in developed democracies is more likely to occur where visibility is lower, both in terms of the actors involved and of the points of influence in allocation processes. Using novel data on politically exposed persons across 28 European countries (2011–2017), I distinguish between elected and unelected political agents in shaping public procurement outcomes. Unelected agents, particularly aides, advisors, and administrative staff, exert stronger influence than elected politicians, who primarily steer upstream processes that offer political cover in uncompetitive bidding situations. In contrast, unelected agents affect both competitive and uncompetitive cases, underscoring the role of political (in)visibility in public resource allocation. This study deepens our understanding of the heterogeneity of corporate political connections and their impact on public–private exchange.Managerial SummaryThis study examines how corporate political influence in developed democracies often operates through less visible channels. Using data on politically exposed persons across 28 European countries, I find that connections to unelected officials, such as aides and advisors, exert greater influence on firms' public procurement outcomes than connections to elected politicians. Elected politicians affect uncompetitive awards by possibly shaping the rules and specifications that restrict competition, rather than intervening during more transparent stages when bids are evaluated. In contrast, unelected officials influence a broader range of competitive and uncompetitive procurements, taking advantage of their lower visibility to engage across processes. These findings raise important implications for public oversight and for firms engaging with government.</content>

    <title>Fundamental Anomalies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a portfolio-independent method to estimate q-theory models, in which parameters are obtained using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to match firm-level stock returns. Our methodology addresses a previous critique on prior studies that model parameters are chosen to fit a specific set of anomalies and different values are needed to fit each anomaly. By targeting the entire sample of firm-level returns and allowing industry and time variations in parameter values, our estimations yield higher correlations between realized and fundamental portfolio returns compared with prior literature. Additionally, the estimated two-capital model generates large and significant size, momentum, profitability, investment, and intangibles premiums, but falls short in explaining the value and accruals anomalies. This limitation underscores the importance of portfolio-independent parameter estimation in evaluating a model’s capability to generate return anomalies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S.

    <title>Whose Rhetoric Matters? Social Responsibility Rhetoric and the Moderating Influence of Social Roles in Crowdfunding Pitches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use role congruity theory to examine how differing role expectations surrounding entrepreneur gender and race shape the influence of social responsibility rhetoric used in crowdfunding pitches. To do so, we develop a novel content‐analytic measure of social responsibility rhetoric using the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) dimensions of social responsibility. Results indicate an inverted U‐shaped relationship between social responsibility rhetoric and funding. Campaigns created by men, particularly men of colour, experience larger performance gains from using such rhetoric than campaigns created by women, but have greater declines in performance at higher levels of such rhetoric. As such, our work extends recent findings regarding the potential ‘dark side’ of social responsibility by showing that the mere use of language related to social responsibility may have negative consequences. We also expand work in entrepreneurship concerning how gender and racial dynamics influence funding outcomes for entrepreneurs, while providing the first content‐analytic measure of social responsibility that is theoretically grounded in the widely used KLD conceptualization of social responsibility prominent in management and entrepreneurship research.</content>

    <title>Fitting innovations into existing categories: Evidence from mortgage‐backed securities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What role do innovators play in the evolution of product categories? While management scholars have documented multiple cases of innovators creating new product categories, less attention has been paid to how innovators reshape existing ones. This paper explores the possibility that innovators can change the boundaries of established categories to accommodate their products. In an historical case study of the acceptance of mortgage‐backed securities (MBS) as bonds in the United States between 1970 and 1995, I find that MBS issuers succeeded in fitting their products into the bond category by introducing a new dimension to the category.Managerial SummaryThis study expands our understanding of category evolution by showing that innovators can reshape the boundaries of existing product categories to accommodate new offerings. Specifically, it finds that innovators succeeded in modifying a prototype‐based category by positioning their product as a substitute—a goal‐based category. Redefining category boundaries allowed the innovators to secure membership for their products without needing to create a new category or fully redesign the product. This research highlights the agentic role of innovators in the evolution of categories, the interaction between goal‐based and prototype‐based categories in innovation diffusion, and the importance of commensuration for achieving product‐category fit.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Social Media on Corporate Innovation: Evidence from Seeking Alpha Coverage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seeking Alpha (SA) is the most popular crowdsourced social media platform specializing in the financial analysis of U.S. firms, and it attracts over 17 million visitors per month. We find that firm coverage initiation on SA significantly promotes corporate innovation activities. SA coverage promotes corporate innovation by disseminating innovation-related information about the covered firm to external investors, thereby alleviating the firm’s financial constraints. Moreover, firms with higher information asymmetry, firms facing greater product market competition, and firms having lower levels of managerial short-termism reveal a greater increase in innovation outcomes following SA coverage initiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that third party-generated information on specialized social media mitigates the information asymmetry between firms and investors on corporate innovation activities and encourages corporate innovation.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00995 .</content>

    <title>Information Disclosure and Competitive Dynamics: Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how competitive dynamics shape innovative firms’ voluntary disclosure of product quality information. Our empirical context is the pharmaceutical industry, where firms must decide whether to disclose private drug quality information acquired in clinical trials. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, we show that the approval of a competitor’s drug lowers the likelihood of a firm reporting its clinical trial results by 13%. We explore how these effects vary based on the project quality, competitor type, and firm experience. These findings suggest that strategic considerations play a role in firms’ disclosure decisions; in response to a competitor’s drug approval, firms may selectively withhold information to maintain and improve their competitive position.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was funded by the National Institute on Aging [Grant T32-AG000186] and the UCLA Society of Hellman Fellows Program.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01161 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an automated system to forecast volatility by leveraging more than 100 features and five machine learning algorithms. Considering the universe of S&amp;P 100 stocks, our system results in superior out-of-sample volatility forecasts compared with existing risk models across forecast horizons. We further demonstrate that our system remains robust to different specifications and is scalable to a broader S&amp;P 500 stock universe via hyperparameter transfer learning. Finally, the statistical improvement in volatility forecasts translates into significant annual returns from a cross-sectional variance risk premium strategy.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01520 .</content>

    <title>Can Improvements to Mobile Internet Service Help Reduce Digital Inequality? An Empirical Analysis of Education and Overall Data Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quality internet access is critical to participating in contemporary society. Unfortunately, many households—particularly those of low socioeconomic status and/or those in rural areas—do not have quality internet access. Some have no access, whereas others are reliant on their mobile data plans for internet access (i.e., they are “smartphone dependent”). This generates inequality in internet access and use. Given the smartphone dependence of many disadvantaged households, we explore whether improvements to mobile internet service can help reduce digital inequality. We focus on a specific improvement: access to unlimited mobile data. For access to unlimited data to help reduce digital inequality, it must generate larger data consumption increases for disadvantaged households than for advantaged ones, including for data likely to enhance welfare, such as online education content. It is not obvious that this will be the case. Accordingly, we use detailed subscriber-level data from a major telecommunications company to examine changes in the consumption of education and other content after subscribers switch to unlimited mobile data plans. We find that although all subscribers increase their consumption, the increases are significantly larger for disadvantaged subscribers, both for overall content and for education content. This is an important finding given that identifying programs that generate disproportionate data consumption increases for disadvantaged households—including for education and other “enhancing” content—is a necessary step for reducing digital inequality.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03770 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine changes in chief executive officer (CEO) labor market outcomes following corporate environmental failures. CEOs of firms subject to Environmental Protection Agency enforcements experience a decline in labor market opportunities as outside directors and a higher likelihood of dismissal as CEOs. They also receive less shareholder support in directorial elections. These effects are mostly visible in recent years and in firms with significant socially responsible investments (SRIs), and they are robust to using state environmental regulations for identification. Shareholders exhibit particular concern over environmental violations that may subject firms to future legal liabilities. Overall, these results point to significant reputational repercussions of environmental failures to CEOs and the disciplinary role of SRIs.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02372 .</content>

    <title>Managing Resources for Shared Micromobility: Approximate Optimality in Large-Scale Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the problem of managing resources in shared micromobility systems (bike sharing and scooter sharing). An important task in managing such systems is periodic repositioning/recharging/sourcing of units to avoid stockouts or excess inventory at nodes with unbalanced flows. We consider a discrete-time model; each period begins with an initial inventory at each node in the network, and then, customers (demand) materialize at the nodes. Each customer picks up a unit at the origin node and drops it off at a randomly sampled destination node with an origin-specific probability distribution. We model the above network inventory management problem as an infinite horizon discrete-time discounted Markov decision process (MDP) and prove the asymptotic optimality of a novel mean-field approximation to the original MDP as the number of stations becomes large. To compute an approximately optimal policy for the mean-field dynamics, we provide an algorithm with a running time that is logarithmic in the desired optimality gap. Lastly, we compare the performance of our mean field-based policy with state-of-the-art heuristics via numerical experiments, including experiments using Austin scooter-sharing data.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02023 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impacts of financial shocks on firm insurance, firm dynamics, and macroeconomic implications. A key departure from the literature is that firms provide wage insurance contracts to risk-averse workers in a long-term relationship. Such contracts endogenously impose a form of inflexible debt liability to firms, and make firms with limited financial net worth more vulnerable to shocks than others. In our model, firms have heterogenous productivity and financial net worth, and also firms face financial frictions. Search and matching in the labor market endogenously determines the value of wage contract, and thus the level of liability to the firm. We have three new findings: (1) The wage dynamics of the quantitative model are consistent with those in empirical studies, with significant insurance against firm-level idiosyncratic shocks, and also a weak comovement between aggregate wage and GDP when there are aggregate shocks. (2) Firms with limited financial resources are hit by financial shocks significantly more than others, with larger negative impacts on dividends, credit borrowing, firm value, and firm entry; the endogenous wage insurance also becomes more limited, and there are more separations. These impacts on both firms and workers are different from—and cannot be accounted for by—standard models with a representative firm or worker. (3) Quantitative exercises for the Great Recession in the United States suggest that aggregate productivity shocks and financial shocks play different roles; without financial shocks, we cannot account for the dynamics of financial variables, including the reduced credit borrowing, spikes in credit spreads, and large drops in dividend payments. Lastly, we provide microlevel empirical supports for our model implications.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On decentralized e-commerce platforms, search algorithms play a critical role in matching buyers and sellers. A typical search algorithm routinely refines and improves its catalog of data to increase search precision, but the effects of a more precise search are little known. We evaluate such effects via a 2019 quasiexperiment on a world-leading e-commerce platform in which the search algorithm refined some product categories into finer subgroups to allocate consumer queries to more relevant product listings. Our data cover millions of consumers’ search and purchase behaviors over six months across multiple search sessions and product categories, enabling us to investigate trade-offs over time and across categories. We find that a more precise search algorithm improves consumers’ click-through and purchase rates drastically and instantaneously, but it comes at the cost of a significant decrease in consumer engagement and unplanned purchases over a longer time horizon. On average, consumers who used to spend more time searching now conduct 5.5% fewer searches, spend 4.1% less time on the platform, and decrease their spending on related categories by 2.2% in the week after the search precision increases. Our examination of the mechanisms behind these consequences calls for more careful search algorithm designs that account for not only instant conversion based on search precision but also consumer engagement and sellers’ strategic responses in the longer horizon.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72141305 and 72192803] and the Ministry of Education, People’s Republic of China (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities), both to L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of a boycott on one of the largest Korean dairy producers, triggered by the exposure of the firm’s unethical management practices, on sales of its own and others. We find empirical evidence that the boycott had substantial and long-lasting consequences. First, consumer utility from the boycotted products decreased significantly, reflecting consumers’ strong willingness to take part in collective action. Second, our discrete choice demand model, which addresses both price endogeneity and product substitution, estimates that sales of the boycotted firm decreased by almost 8% or, equivalently, by 8.1 million liters during the 12-month postboycott period. Third, the boycotted firm’s sales and revenue decreases would have been more severe had the firm not cut prices after the boycott outbreak. Our findings emphasize top-level managers’ role in fostering an ethical organizational culture within the firm and taking proper and timely countermeasures to curb losses incurred by a boycott.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Asian Studies Center of Michigan State University [Dr. Delia Koo Faculty Endowment Award] and Sogang University [New Faculty Research Funding Grant 202310031.01].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01062 .</content>

    <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Assessing Experts’ Decision Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Expert workers make non-trivial decisions with significant implications. Experts’ decision accuracy is, thus, a fundamental aspect of their judgment quality, key to both management and consumers of experts’ services. Yet, in many important settings, transparency in experts’ decision quality is rarely possible because ground truth data for evaluating the experts’ decisions is costly and available only for a limited set of decisions. Furthermore, different experts typically handle exclusive sets of decisions, and thus, prior solutions that rely on the aggregation of multiple experts’ decisions for the same instance are inapplicable. We first formulate the problem of estimating experts’ decision accuracy in this setting and then develop a machine–learning–based framework to address it. Our method effectively leverages both abundant historical data on workers’ past decisions and scarce decision instances with ground truth labels. Using both semi-synthetic data based on publicly available data sets and purposefully compiled data sets on real workers’ decisions, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations of our method’s performance relative to alternatives. The results show that our approach is superior to existing alternatives across diverse settings, including settings that involve different data domains, experts’ qualities, and amounts of ground truth data. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to posit and address the problem of estimating experts’ decision accuracies from historical data with scarce ground truth, and it is the first to offer comprehensive results for this problem setting, establishing the performances that can be achieved across settings as well as the state-of-the-art performance on which future work can build.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: T.

    <title>A Structural Topic and Sentiment-Discourse Model for Text Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the common setting where one observes a large number of opinionated text documents and related covariates, such as the text of online reviews along with the date of the review and the author demographic information. In this setting it can be of interest to understand how the covariates determine the text composition, as well as the prevalence, sentiment, and/or discourse of various discussion themes. Yet, most topic modeling methods in the machine learning literature are designed to summarize the text for the purpose of exploratory analysis and not to perform this type of formal statistical inference. Further, topic modeling methods generally do not try to estimate the sentiment or discourse of discussion along separate topics that can be critical in business applications (e.g., for summarizing service or product quality). We develop a topic model called the structural topic and sentiment-discourse (STS) model that introduces a new document-level latent variable that captures the sentiment and/or discourse (termed as “sentiment-discourse”) for each topic, which modulates the word frequency within a topic. These latent topic sentiment-discourse variables are controlled by document-level covariates to allow for experimental control and regression analysis. We also introduce new computational methods to resolve scalability issues that have forced previous models to restrict to a small number of categorical covariates. We benchmark the STS model on three real-world data sets from surveys, blogs, and Yelp restaurant reviews around the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model recovers meaningful results including rich insights about how COVID-19 affects online reviews, demonstrating that the STS model can be useful for regression analysis with text data in addition to topic modeling’s traditional use of descriptive analysis.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00261 .

    <title>Quality Improvement Spillovers: Evidence from the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quality knowledge spillovers can enhance the overall effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives. We study the presence and moderators of such spillovers in a multitask service setting, specifically in hospital inpatient care. Leveraging a national quality improvement regulation, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which offers partial incentives for hospitals to reduce readmissions, we employ difference-in-differences econometric models on a nationwide database and find positive quality spillovers in the healthcare sector. Our findings indicate that the implementation of HRRP led to a significant decrease in 30-day readmissions among patients with clinical conditions or insurance types that were not targeted by the policy. Additionally, we find that task similarity played a positive role in promoting quality spillovers, while a hospital’s operational focus on target patients (i.e., the proportion of hospital volume targeted by the policy) did not moderate these spillovers. Notably, we observe that hospitals achieved these quality improvements without increasing the intensity of care provided, and that meaningful improvements in quality were associated with up to a 3% reduction in hospitalization costs. This paper contributes novel insights into how regulators and policymakers can design narrow public policies and regulations that achieve broader results by exploiting the beneficial quality improvement spillovers of partial incentives.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Support for this research was provided by the Alberta School of Business Faculty Seed Grant and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01062 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a single-factor setting in which there is private information regarding cash flows as well as their betas. Private information about betas, together with market makers’ risk aversion and mean betas’ nonnegativity, implies a nonlinear price schedule whose stochastic slope covaries positively with order flow when the expected factor payoff is positive and vice versa. We predict a negative relation between the covariance and expected returns and an attenuation of the beta anomaly in asset returns after accounting for this relation. Empirical tests confirm these predictions.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that equity loan fees, which have been largely ignored by the anomalies literature, are the best predictor of cross-sectional returns. When compared with 102 other anomalies and other short-selling measures, the loan fee anomaly has the highest monthly long-short return (4.01%), the highest monthly Sharpe Ratio (0.66), and, unlike other anomalies, exhibits strong persistence throughout the sample. Although prior work has shown that existing anomalies reside in high loan fee stocks, we find that 42% of loan fee outperformance is due to unique information not contained in other anomalies. Future papers that examine cross-sectional predictors of returns should include the single most effective predictor: loan fees.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00152 .</content>

    <title>On-Demand Delivery Platforms and Restaurant Sales</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Restaurants are increasingly relying on on-demand delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats) to reach customers and fulfill takeout orders. Although on-demand delivery is a valuable option for consumers, whether restaurants benefit from or are being hurt by partnering with these platforms remains unclear. This paper investigates whether and to what extent the platform delivery channel substitutes restaurants’ own takeout/dine-in channels and the net impact on restaurant revenue. Empirical analyses show that restaurants overall benefit from on-demand delivery platforms—these platforms increase restaurants’ total takeout sales while creating positive spillovers to customer dine-in visits. However, the platform effects are substantially heterogeneous, depending on the type of restaurants (independent versus chain) and the type of customer channels (takeout versus dine-in). The overall positive effect on fast-food chains is four times as large as that on independent restaurants. For takeout, delivery platforms substitute independent restaurants’ but complement chain restaurants’ own takeout sales. For dine-in, delivery platforms increase both independent and chain restaurants’ dine-in visits by a similar magnitude. Therefore, the value of delivery platforms to independent restaurants mostly comes from the increase in dine-in visits, whereas the value to chain restaurants primarily comes from the gain in takeout sales. Further, the platform delivery channel facilitates price competition and reduces the opportunity for independent restaurants to differentiate with premium services and dine-in experience, which may explain why independent restaurants do not benefit as much from on-demand delivery platforms.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a parsimonious price formation model to study information aggregation and information acquisition in the presence of trading delays. If delays apply uniformly to uninformed and informed traders, the level of delays does not affect information aggregation. Traders’ information acquisition incentives are, however, weaker in a market with longer delays. Therefore, the equilibrium fraction of informed traders is lower if delays are longer, establishing an inverse relationship between trading delays and price informativeness. We also show that risk premia and price dispersion tend to be nonmonotonic functions of the level of delays when information acquisition is endogenous. We document novel empirical evidence from the UK corporate bond market, which largely corroborates the implications of our theory.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01400 .</content>

    <title>Private Optimal Inventory Policy Learning for Feature-Based Newsvendor with Unknown Demand</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The data-driven newsvendor problem with features has recently emerged as a significant area of research, driven by the proliferation of data across various sectors such as retail, supply chains, e-commerce, and healthcare. Given the sensitive nature of customer or organizational data often used in feature-based analysis, it is crucial to ensure individual privacy to uphold trust and confidence. Despite its importance, privacy preservation in the context of inventory planning remains unexplored. A key challenge is the nonsmoothness of the newsvendor loss function, which sets it apart from existing work on privacy-preserving algorithms in other settings. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating a privacy-preserving optimal inventory policy within the f-differential privacy framework, an extension of the classical [Formula: see text]-differential privacy with several appealing properties. We develop a clipped noisy gradient descent algorithm based on convolution smoothing for optimal inventory estimation to simultaneously address three main challenges: (i) unknown demand distribution and nonsmooth loss function, (ii) provable privacy guarantees for individual-level data, and (iii) desirable statistical precision. We derive finite-sample high-probability bounds for optimal policy parameter estimation and regret analysis. By leveraging the structure of the newsvendor problem, we attain a faster excess population risk bound compared with that obtained from an indiscriminate application of existing results for general nonsmooth convex loss. Our bound aligns with that for strongly convex and smooth loss function. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed new method can achieve desirable privacy protection with a marginal increase in cost.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most research on systemic stability assumes an economy where banks are subject to exogenous shocks. However, in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. I show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: the risk exposure choices made by connected banks are strategically complementary. Banks within financial networks, especially densely connected ones, become endogenously exposed to excessive risks. The theory offers several novel perspectives on policy debates. For instance, it suggests that limiting government bailouts to interbank exposures can effectively reduce endogenous systemic risk.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the USC Dornsife Institute for New Economic Thinking Fellowship, the Marshall PhD Fellowship, and European Finance Association Doctoral Tutorial Best Paper Prize.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01519 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether leveraged buyout (LBO) sponsors’ reputations as borrowers affect the refinancing terms of their portfolio companies. In 510 U.S. LBOs for which we can reconstruct debt financing activity, 67% of financing events occur one quarter before the earliest existing debt maturity. These On Time events generally improve borrowing terms, whereas Early events feature more dividends, leverage, and higher cost. In each case, dividend issuance decreases and cost increases with the proportion of the sponsors’ recent exits that are failures. Effects are absent for matched firms and prior to the LBO and are procyclical; sponsors with recent failures miss opportunities to decrease financing costs in good times.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00971 .</content>

    <title>Measuring Investor Attention Using Google Search</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although investor attention is fundamental to the efficient functioning of capital markets, it is also an elusive construct that researchers struggle to measure. In recent years, the search volume index (SVI) of ticker searches on Google has become a ubiquitous measure of investor attention, but the amount and effects of measurement error in ticker SVI are unknown. We investigate measurement error in ticker SVI using a data set of 2.7 billion website visits following Standard and Poor’s 500 firms’ ticker searches. We find that 69% of searches are unrelated to investing, that this measurement error is highly correlated with firm characteristics, and that this measurement error can easily generate false-positive or false-negative results in common settings. We go on to show that a modified version of SVI using both a firm’s ticker and the word “stock” (e.g., searches for “CAT stock,” which we label “ticker-stock SVI”) not only better captures the search terms that investors typically use, but also has considerably less measurement error that is largely uncorrelated with observable firm characteristics. Ticker-stock SVI produces better specified tests, and although researchers must still carefully consider the effects of measurement error, we recommend that ticker-stock SVI is used in place of ticker SVI in most settings. We provide a data set of ticker-stock SVI to facilitate future work.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivisan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02174 .

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study empirically examines the relation between audit quality and auditors’ cognitive and social skills. Using a novel data set of online job postings by accounting firms, we document substantial variation in the stated demand for auditors’ cognitive and social skills, suggesting that audit offices are not homogeneous in their preferences for such skills. We find a positive relation between audit quality and the prevalence of cognitive and social skills within an audit office’s job postings. This association is stronger for audit engagements that are more complex or require greater coordination, suggesting that cognitive and social skills are particularly important in engagements where effective communication and knowledge transfer, as well as sound professional judgment and skepticism, are needed. The association is also stronger for audit offices with greater investments in new technology, consistent with the complementary relation between cognitive and social skills and the use of technology. Overall, our study offers empirical evidence linking specific auditor skills to audit quality.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <title>Fiscal Stimulus, Deposit Competition, and the Rise of Shadow Banking: Evidence from China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of shadow banking and attendant financial fragility in China can be traced to intensified deposit competition following the 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC). A large, state-owned bank’s deposits from cross-border money inflows fell significantly following the GFC, and it supported the government’s fiscal stimulus more aggressively than other large banks by issuing larger volumes of new loans. Small and medium-sized banks with more branch-level overlaps with this large bank relied more on shadow banking and issued more wealth management products (WMPs)—short-maturity, off-balance-sheet substitutes for deposits. Greater amounts of WMPs created rollover risks for the issuers, as reflected by higher yields on new WMPs, higher borrowing rates in the interbank market, and lower stock-market performance during liquidity stress.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71272024, 71972051, and 72071117].Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04233 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show how manufacturers can benefit from contracts that incentivize retailers to purchase multiple products from the same manufacturer. We isolate two effects: first, under standard contractual inefficiencies, which give rise to double marginalization, such contracts can increase channel profits (the “improved contractual efficiency” effect); second, when a weaker product is tied to a particularly strong “must-stock” product, such contracts can also reduce a retailer’s position and shift rent to the manufacturer (the “increased rent extraction” effect). To harness these effects, we show that it can even be profitable for the manufacturer to introduce a weak product that ultimately has the effect of foreclosing a rival’s more efficient substitute. Nevertheless, unless the tying product is sufficiently strong, the overall effect on welfare can still be positive, providing manufacturers with an efficiency rationale to use against common concerns held by antitrust agencies about such practices.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many scholars have called for raising statistical hurdles to guard against false discoveries in academic publications. I show these calls may be difficult to justify empirically. Published data exhibit bias: Results that fail to meet existing hurdles are often unobserved. These unobserved results must be extrapolated, which can lead to weak identification of revised hurdles. In contrast, statistics that can target only published findings (e.g. empirical Bayes shrinkage and the false discovery rate) can be strongly identified, as data on published findings are plentiful. I demonstrate these results theoretically and in an empirical analysis of the cross-sectional return predictability literature.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03083 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunding can suffer from information asymmetry, leaving some investors disappointed with low-quality projects, whereas other high-quality projects remain unfunded. We show that refund bonuses, which provide investors a payment if a fundraising campaign is unsuccessful, can signal project quality and help overcome the market failure in crowdfunding. Because strong projects have a lower risk of bonus payout, entrepreneurs with strong projects are more likely to offer bonuses. This signals high quality to investors, and due to their updated beliefs, this drives investment toward such projects. An experiment provides supporting empirical evidence for the benefits of this signaling solution to the problems of information asymmetry in crowdfunding.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by Schmidt Sciences.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03923 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;By design, the Bitcoin protocol has a low throughput. The Lightning Network (LN) is a layer-two solution built to increase throughput by cryptographically securing commitments to transactions and only occasionally converting cumulative balances into on-chain transactions. LN channels enable payments between nodes connected by a path of channels. The payment flow through a channel determines its cost. Different channel topologies can support the same underlying flows but impose different costs. This paper obtains necessary conditions for cost-minimizing topologies by identifying local cost-reducing strategies. The first local strategy entails repositioning of channels. The second entails adding hubs to handle the flows of groups of nodes. The paper also evaluates the efficiency of a global configuration, obtaining bounds on the minimum cost topology and showing the unusual circumstances in which the cost minimal structure is a hub that connects to all other nodes.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was partially supported by Science Foundation Ireland [Grants 16/IA/4443, 16/SPP/3347], Columbia-International Business Machines Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency, Chaire Fintech at University Paris Dauphine-Paris Sciences et Lettres, Algorand Foundation, and Simons Institute.</content>

    <title>Trading Flexibility for Adoption: From Dynamic to Static Walking in Ride-Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand ride-sharing aims to fulfill riders’ transportation needs whenever and wherever they want. Although this service level appeals to riders, overall system efficiency can improve substantially if riders are willing to be flexible. Here, we explore riders’ flexibility in space via walking to more accessible pickup locations. Ride-sharing platforms have traditionally implemented dynamic walking to optimize rider pickup locations and rider-driver assignment jointly. We propose an alternative that we call static walking, which presents a predetermined pickup location to the rider before optimizing rider-driver assignment. Although dynamic walking enables more efficient matching of riders and drivers, we hypothesize that riders prefer static walking because of the certainty of the pickup location before booking the ride. Using simulations on Lyft data, we show that static walking can capture up to 96% of the value of dynamic walking in congested urban networks at a fixed adoption rate. Furthermore, experimentation on Lyft’s user interface suggests that providing riders with information on pickup location before an opt-in decision can increase walking adoption—to the extent that static walking may outperform dynamic walking overall. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of carefully designing flexibility mechanisms on platforms: a little flexibility goes a long way, especially when flexibility presents a barrier to adoption.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Platform Financing vs. Trade Credit for Lending to Third-Party Sellers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study platform financing in comparison with trade credit for lending to third-party sellers, considering scenarios where default risk is driven by external factors (exogenous) or influenced by the parties’ decisions (endogenous). Our findings indicate that under exogenous default risk, although platform financing exposes the platform to the seller’s default risk, it can enhance the seller’s sales by providing low-rate finance and reducing the wholesale price because the supplier remains isolated from default risk. Platform financing emerges in equilibrium, benefiting all parties, particularly in businesses facing significant default risk, high product costs, operating in small markets, or having a high commission rate. In cases of endogenous default risk, platform financing can mitigate the seller’s opportunistic behavior, either preventing or reducing default risk, and the effects of product costs and market uncertainty may become nonmonotonic. In certain scenarios, platform financing arises in equilibrium when the product cost is intermediate or sufficiently high but not in between and when market uncertainty is moderate but not low or high. We also explore the impacts of the seller’s initial capital and credit limits, providing valuable managerial insights.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The corresponding author, X.

    <title>Capturing the Benefits of Autonomous Vehicles in Ride Hailing: The Role of Market Configuration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an economic model of autonomous vehicle (AV) ride-hailing markets, in which uncertain aggregate demand is served with a combination of a fixed fleet of AVs and a flexible pool of human drivers (HVs). Dispatch efficiencies increase with scale because of density effects. We analyze market outcomes in this setting under four market configurations, defined by two dispatch platform structures (common platform versus independent platforms) and two levels of supply competition (monopoly AV versus competitive AV). A key result of our analysis is that the lower cost of AVs does not necessarily translate into lower prices; the price impact of AVs is ambiguous and depends critically on both the dispatch platform structure and the level of AV supply competition. In the extreme case, we show that if AVs and HVs operate on independent dispatch platforms, there is a monopoly AV supplier, and labor supply elasticity is sufficiently high, then prices are even higher than in a pure-HV market. Indeed, to guarantee consistently lower prices (relative to a pure HV market) in all scenarios and under all supply and density elasticities, a common dispatch platform between AVs and HVs is required. Furthermore, competitive AVs lead to lower prices than monopoly AVs in every such scenario. Our results illustrate the critical role that market configuration plays in realizing potential welfare gains from AVs.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03112 .</content>

    <title>Extubation Decisions with Predictive Information for Mechanically Ventilated Patients in the ICU</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Weaning patients from mechanical ventilators is a crucial decision in intensive care units (ICUs), significantly affecting patient outcomes and the throughput of ICUs. This study aims to improve the current extubation protocols by incorporating predictive information on patient health conditions. We develop a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process with predictions of future state to support extubation decisions. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and provide important insights into how predictive information can lead to different decision protocols. We demonstrate that adding predictive information is always beneficial, even if physicians place excessive trust in the predictions, as long as the predictive model is moderately accurate. Using a comprehensive data set from an ICU in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, we evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and demonstrate that incorporating predictive information can reduce ICU length of stay by up to 3.4% and, simultaneously, decrease the extubation failure rate by up to 20.3%, compared with the optimal policy that does not utilize prediction. These benefits are more significant for patients with poor initial conditions upon ICU admission. Both our analytical and numerical findings suggest that predictive information is particularly valuable in identifying patients who could benefit from continued intubation, thereby allowing for personalized and delayed extubation for these patients.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 2, Ministry of Education, Singapore [Grant MOE2019-T2-1-185] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71921001 and 72091210].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01427 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing number of institutions exploiting factor-investing strategies raises concerns that competition may erode profits. We use a game-theoretic model to show that, whereas competition among investors exploiting a particular factor erodes profits because of the negative externality of their price impact on each other, competition to exploit other factors can increase profits from the first factor because of the positive externality from trading diversification (netting of trades across factors). Using data for 18 factors as well as mutual fund holdings, we show that competition and trading diversification substantially affect the profits from factor investing.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors received an INQUIRE-Europe research grant for this project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02684 .</content>

    <title>A Simple and Optimal Policy Design with Safety Against Heavy-Tailed Risk for Stochastic Bandits</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and design new policies that enjoy both optimal regret expectation and light-tailed risk for regret distribution. We first find that any policy that obtains the optimal instance-dependent expected regret could incur a heavy-tailed regret tail risk that decays slowly with T. We then focus on policies that achieve optimal worst-case expected regret. We design a novel policy that (i) enjoys the worst-case optimality for regret expectation and (ii) has the worst-case tail probability of incurring a regret larger than any regret threshold that decays exponentially with respect to T. The decaying rate is proved to be optimal for all worst-case optimal policies. Our proposed policy achieves a delicate balance between doing more exploration at the beginning of the time horizon and doing more exploitation when approaching the end, compared with standard confidence-bound-based policies. We also enhance the policy design to accommodate the “any-time” setting where T is unknown a priori, highlighting “lifelong exploration”, and prove equivalently desired policy performances as compared with the “fixed-time” setting with known T. From a managerial perspective, we show through numerical experiments that our new policy design yields similar efficiency and better safety compared to celebrated policies. Our policy design is preferable especially when (i) there is a risk of underestimating the volatility profile, or (ii) there is a challenge of tuning policy hyper-parameters. We conclude by extending our proposed policy design to the stochastic linear bandit setting that leads to both worst-case optimality in terms of regret expectation and light-tailed risk on regret distribution.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Strategic Expert Committees and the Markets That Assess Them: A Laboratory Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Committees of experts are widely used to make decisions. We experimentally investigate the relationship between decision making in committees and the assessment of the ability of committee members by evaluators, comparing observed behavior with theoretical predictions. Treatments vary in whether members care only about a state-dependent project payoff or also about assessments and whether evaluators can base their assessments only on the decision the committee makes or also on cheap-talk statements made by committee members on their confidence in the committee decision. Evidence for the equilibrium predictions is mixed; for example, contrary to theory, committees with a concern for their assessment do not distort their decisions more than committees without, whereas in line with theory, evaluators give higher assessments to committees that take the risky decision rather than the riskless. We analyze whether evaluators rationally base their assessments on observed behavior of committees using an orthogonality test. In treatments with cheap-talk statements, assessments are quite rational; in treatments without, they are too low on average. We investigate whether committees best reply to expected project payoffs and, in treatments in which members’ payoffs also depend on assessments, to predicted assessments conditional on observed committee behavior. In all treatments, committees respond to the possibilities to raise expected payoffs but do not use them as much as predicted by theory. We conclude by showing that the amount of information about committee members’ abilities that ends up in assessments is considerably larger when evaluators observe committees’ decisions and statements rather than only decisions.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) under the grant 400-09-338; and Erasmus University Rotterdam [Grant CSTO 2014–54].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03007 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of the influencer marketing industry warrants an empirical examination of the effect of posting sponsored videos on influencers’ reputations. We collected a novel data set of user-generated YouTube videos created by prominent English-speaking influencers in the beauty and style category. We extracted a rich set of theory-driven video features and used DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux reweighting to construct comparable treatment and control groups matched at the influencer-video level. The empirical analysis of the matched sample revealed a reputation-burning effect; that is, posting a sponsored video, compared with posting an equivalent organic video, cost the influencers 0.19% of their reputation (operationalized as the number of subscribers). The reputation-burning effect was stronger among the influencers with larger audiences. An analysis of likes, comments, and comment texts revealed a larger gap in audience response between sponsored and organic videos among the influencers with larger (versus smaller) audiences. The reputation-burning effect was mitigated when a high fit existed between the sponsored content and the influencer’s “usual” content and when the promoted brand was less well known. Our study empirically tested the assumption of several theoretical works. Moreover, it contributes to the literature on influencer marketing and celebrity endorsements and provides managerial implications for influencers, brands, and social media platforms.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide robust evidence that rank-and-file employee stock options (R&amp;F options) lead to lower work-related injury rates. This finding is consistent with the view that R&amp;F options improve workplace safety by facilitating employee retention and cooperation. To establish causality, we employ difference-in-differences analysis around the passage of FAS 123R option expensing regulation and instrumental variable estimation. In cross-sectional analysis, we find that the documented effect is amplified among firms with higher labor mobility rates and among firms with greater scope for employee free riding. The results of supplemental analysis suggest that work-related injuries adversely impact firm performance and rule out reduced employee whistleblowing about workplace safety issues as an alternative mechanism driving our findings.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02072 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first approximation algorithm for dynamic inventory management on a network with stochastic demand and backlogging. Specifically, under a mild cost condition, we prove the cost of a specially designed base-stock policy is less than 1.618 times the cost of an optimal policy. We develop a novel stochastic programming analysis to prove this result: We carefully calibrate two stochastic programs (providing upper and lower bounds on the optimal policy), and compare their objectives. The upper bound arises from a new class of base-stock policies we define to address the currently unresolved issue of how to assign and fulfill backlogs in a system with fulfillment flexibility. We show the optimal policy in this class takes a simple and intuitive form: backlogs are assigned to their lowest cost activities for replenishment, and the ordered resources for those activities are committed to the backlogs for fulfillment. Next, the lower bound stochastic program is derived through a novel cost accounting scheme that captures the tradeoff between current inventory decisions and future backlog decisions. We then exploit this tradeoff to bound the ratio of the two stochastic program objectives and prove our main result. We also demonstrate our policy’s practicality with numerical simulations that show it performs within 1% of optimal on average across a wide range of problem instances. Finally, we show that our techniques and results extend to more general settings, demonstrating their potential for broader applicability. Importantly, our approach extends to problems with lead times, where we prove an approximation guarantee for base-stock policies that is independent of both the lead time and network structure. Thus, our work provides the new managerial insight that properly designed base-stock policies can be effective in network settings.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02965 .</content>

    <title>A Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent-Based Learning Metapolicy for Inventory Systems with Myopic Optimal Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has proven effective in solving many inventory control problems with demand learning. However, it often faces the pitfall of an infeasible target inventory level that is lower than the current inventory level. Several recent works have been successful in resolving this issue in various inventory systems. However, their techniques are rather sophisticated and difficult to apply to more complicated scenarios, such as multiproduct and multiconstraint inventory systems. In this paper, we address the infeasible target inventory-level issue from a new technical perspective; we propose a novel minibatch SGD-based metapolicy. Our metapolicy is flexible enough to be applied to a general inventory systems framework covering a wide range of inventory management problems with myopic clairvoyant optimal policy. By devising the optimal minibatch scheme, our metapolicy achieves a regret bound of [Formula: see text] for the general convex case and [Formula: see text] for the strongly convex case. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our metapolicy, we apply it to three important inventory control problems, multiproduct and multiconstraint systems, multiechelon serial systems, and one-warehouse and multistore systems, by carefully designing application-specific subroutines. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our metapolicy enjoys competitive regret performance, high computational efficiency, and low variances among a wide range of applications.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do individuals anticipate time inconsistency in others? This paper jointly investigates beliefs about one’s own and others’ present bias. In an online laboratory experiment, participants engaged in a real-effort task display little awareness of their own present bias but anticipate present bias in others. Structurally, I estimate a present bias parameter [Formula: see text] of 0.82. Participants perceive others’ [Formula: see text] to be 0.87, indicating substantial sophistication, contrasted with 1.03 for themselves, indicating full naïveté. At the individual level, asymmetric naïveté correlates with overoptimism regarding one’s own versus others’ task enjoyment and time availability. The wedge in beliefs about present bias can inform equilibrium outcomes in a number of collaborative, competitive, and hierarchical settings, including teams in the workplace, management practices such as deadlines and tournament incentive schemes, and household consumption decisions.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Financial support from the Laboratory for Economic Applications and Policy (Harvard University); Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior (Harvard University); Harvard Business School (PhD Research Budget); and the Russell Sage Foundation (Small Research Grant) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01780 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do digital payment technologies generate liquidity premia like cash and Treasury? We provide an estimate in the context of the world’s largest digital payment platform, Alipay. Our empirical strategy exploits the variation in the timing of the introduction of money market funds that users on this platform can hold and use for digital transactions. We find that, once a fund becomes eligible for these transactions, its size increases by 45 times on average. Through the lens of an equilibrium demand system model, we show that this size increase implies a liquidity premium of 0.8% per annum. This result provides a unique perspective for understanding and calibrating the liquidity premium of digital currencies.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01309 .</content>

    <title>Does Employing Skilled Immigrants Enhance Competitive Performance? Evidence from European Football Clubs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the effect of employing skilled immigrants on the competitive performance of organizations by studying European football (soccer) clubs in Germany, Italy, France, England, and Spain from 1990 to 2020. Microdata from this setting offers unusual transparency about players’ birthplaces and their contributions to organizational performance. Further, country-level rules govern how many immigrant players clubs can deploy. Using changes to these rules as the basis for instrumental variables, we find that the number of immigrant players in the club’s starting lineup has a positive local average treatment effect on the club’s performance. We show that this occurs for two related reasons. First, immigrants exhibit higher individual talent. Second, immigrants play a coordinating role that enables the organization to broaden the variety of on-field strategies and actions it uses to outperform rivals. The latter mechanism is novel to the literature.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: F.

    <title>The Impact of Blockchain‐Enabled Smart Contracts on Firms' Operational Efficiency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smart contracts, enabled by blockchain technology, are increasingly adopted by firms to automate the execution of agreements or contracts without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it is still unclear how smart contracts may affect firms' operational efficiency. We address this issue empirically by conducting a quasi‐natural experiment in the United States in which certain states have enacted relevant laws that increase in‐state firms' propensity to adopt and use smart contracts. Our difference‐in‐differences estimation suggests that compared with out‐of‐state control firms, in‐state treatment firms' operational efficiency increases significantly after the enactment of smart contract laws. Our post hoc analysis further suggests that state‐level smart contract laws help increase in‐state firms' actual smart contract activities, which in turn lead to operational efficiency improvement. We also find that the operational efficiency improvement varies across firms with different supply chain complexities. While firms with a large number of supply chain partners (i.e., high horizontal complexity) gain more operational efficiency improvement, the improvement becomes less pronounced if firms' supply chain partners are distributed across different countries (i.e., high spatial complexity). Overall, our research not only demonstrates smart contracts' ability to improve operational efficiency but also reveals the critical role of supply chain complexity in affecting the operational efficiency improvement.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Will I Be With(out) You? Consequences of Perceived Romantic Relationship Status Stability on Product Rentals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The current research identifies perceived romantic relationship status stability (RSS)—the degree to which one anticipates their current relationship status to remain unchanged in the foreseeable future—as a significant factor that impacts consumers’ likelihood of renting products. Analyses of field data and experimental studies reveal that low (vs. high) RSS increases consumers’ preference for renting, but not purchasing, products. The effect holds both for low-risk products consumed individually (i.e., when a romantic partner or relationship status is less likely to matter in the acquisition decision) and for high-risk acquisitions such as owning vs. renting a home across representative samples of the US population. The effect occurs because low RSS, an indicator of lower perceived self-concept continuity, heightens the motivation for self-expansion. In contrast to purchasing, renting is a flexible and low-commitment acquisition method that helps consumers self-expand by exploring new products while not inhibiting future explorations. As such, the heightened motivation for self-expansion caused by low RSS increases consumers’ preference for renting but does not influence their preference for purchasing. Managerially, our findings present marketers with insights on to whom and/or when to provide rental versus purchase options, and how to communicate these options to different consumer segments.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Influential Solo Consumer: When Engaging in Activities Alone (vs. Accompanied) Increases the Impact of Recommendations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information about the social context of consumption is often seen on review websites or social media when consumers sharing word-of-mouth about an experience indicate whether they engaged in the activity solo or with companions. Across a secondary dataset scraped from Tripadvisor.com, five main experiments, and one supplemental experiment, the current research finds that individuals who engage in consumption activities alone can be a more influential source of recommendations than people who engage in these same activities with others. The results support an attribution-based process, such that people are more likely to attribute a solo (vs. accompanied) review to the quality of the activity itself, leading the solo (vs. accompanied) person’s review to be particularly influential. Further, the studies test the theorizing that perceived interest on the part of the solo (vs. accompanied) consumer leads to the stronger attribution to quality, and therefore that additional cues to intrinsic interest (e.g., presence of a cue to intrinsic or extrinsic motivation) attenuate the influence of solo (vs. accompanied) word-of-mouth. This work has theoretical and managerial relevance for those who seek to understand how the social context of consumption influences other consumers.</content>

    <title>Clash of the Titans: Conflict Intensity, Community Dependence on Environmental Resources, and Stakeholder Multiplicity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extending the stakeholder multiplicity perspective and resource dependence theory, this study investigates how the dependency of both a company and a community on environmental resources for livelihoods influences the conflict intensity between them. We theorize that companies face difficulties in managing key stakeholders when these stakeholders heavily rely on environmental resources for their livelihoods. We also argue that their conflicted relationship depends on surrounding stakeholders' involvements. This study highlights that stakeholder multiplicity shapes the dynamics in stakeholder salience (competing or cooperating), which in turn affects companies' approach toward them. The study analyses 318 global mining conflicts spanning from 2002 to 2013 using a hand‐collected, multi‐source dataset. Empirical findings reveal that local communities' dependence on environmental resources increases the intensity of conflicts between mining companies and communities. The positive effect of communities' resource dependence on conflict intensity is weakened by the involvement of environment‐oriented (vis‐a‐vis growth‐oriented) government actors. In contrast, the lack of support from broader society (societal inequality) strengthens this effect.</content>

    <title>Oasis in the desert or icing on the cake? The impact of entrepreneurship accelerators across ecosystems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effectiveness of accelerators in fostering new venture development has traditionally been attributed to variations in their internal operations and design, with limited consideration of contextual factors. This study broadens the understanding of accelerators by situating their roles in relation to entrepreneurial ecosystems and introducing a multi-level framework on how macro-level institutions and meso-level accelerator programs interact to shape venture growth. By linking organizational theories on accelerators with institutional economics, this research juxtaposes and tests two perspectives: institutional voids and institutional support. On the one hand, accelerators address institutional voids by acting as intermediaries in entrepreneurial resource markets through knowledge and resource curation, network brokerage, and signaling. On the other hand, the effectiveness of these intermediation roles is constrained by the quality of institutions. Contrary to the prevailing belief that accelerators deliver greater value in underdeveloped institutional environments with inefficient entrepreneurial resource markets, the findings reveal that ventures in such contexts derive less growth benefit from accelerators. This study contributes to the growing body of comparative and international accelerator research and offers broader implications for meso-level intervention programs, suggesting these programs require working in concert with robust ecosystems rather than operating in isolation in order to achieve their intended objectives.</content>

    <title>Second-Order Knowledge Intermediaries and Multi-Country Entrepreneurial Entry into a Nascent Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can a knowledge intermediary support industry development and entrepreneurial entry in countries where it is not present? This study introduces a two-stage model of multi-country entrepreneurial entry via second-order knowledge intermediaries (SOKIs). In Stage 1, SOKIs acquire and develop industry-building knowledge and capabilities from engagement with the activities of carrying, co-creating, capacity building, and convening of a first-order knowledge intermediary (FOKI). In Stage 2, motivated SOKIs implement these activities in secondary countries, supporting local industry development. The model is developed in the context of the clean cookstove industry, which addresses global health and environmental challenges among low-income populations. Qualitative evidence from 25 interviews and archival data were used to describe how SOKIs learned transferable knowledge and capabilities in primary countries. A quantitative analysis of data derived from 1,996 clean cookstove organizations operating across 113 countries (2013–2019) was conducted to assess whether a greater number of SOKIs in secondary countries was associated with increased entrepreneurial entries. Results support the model; more SOKIs were associated with more entrepreneurial entries, and this relationship was weakened when company and nonprofit SOKIs were imbalanced and when more domestic industry actors possessed overlapping knowledge. This study contributes to the literature on industry emergence by introducing a mechanism of non-firm-led, cross-border knowledge diffusion in mission-oriented industries. It also shows how local entrepreneurs in under-resourced contexts can access global knowledge—not through firms or FOKIs but through SOKIs that extend the FOKIs’ work.Funding: This work was supported by funding from the University of Michigan, including the C.K.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the use of a prevalent but rarely studied form of intellectual property protection: trade secrecy. Building on existing survey evidence of firm-level, cross-sectional use of secrecy, we document the effect of stronger legal protections for trade secrets on the project-level use of such secrets. Our setting is the U.S. oil and gas hydraulic fracturing industry, from 2014 to 2018, in states where firms are required to disclose fracturing fluid ingredients to regulators except for substantiated claims of trade secrets. We examine how the enactment of the federal 2016 Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) affects well-level trade secret use across states with varying levels of pre-DTSA protection. We find substantial increases in the use and novelty of trade secrets. Further, wells with trade secret ingredients are, on average, more productive. However, the DTSA exerts limited additional effect on trade secret–related productivity. Supplementary tests address alternative explanations, show no evidence of intellectual property substitution, and provide additional support that we are capturing policy effects. Our results provide rare empirical evidence on actual trade secret use and enhance our understanding of how appropriability shapes use of trade secrets and associated inventive activity.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01138 .</content>

    <title>The Need for Speed: The Impact of Capital Constraints on Strategic Misconduct</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing literature suggests that firms engage in misconduct in response to financial pressure. However, the extent and severity of misconduct have been challenging to determine given the lack of granular data. This limitation is particularly true for smaller firms in emerging markets whose profitability and survival depend on misconduct. This study analyzes the impact of reducing capital constraints on misconduct using high-frequency global positioning system and financing data from the minibus taxi industry in South Africa. I find that lower interest rates, a proxy for lower capital constraints, decrease the most severe forms of misconduct measured by the propensity to speed and crash yet leave more modest forms of misconduct unchanged. Qualitative interviews and survey data suggest that these results are attributable to firms’ efforts to avoid default. These findings contribute to understanding misconduct as a firm strategy when facing financial pressure and suggest that lower capital constraints might improve firm survival and public safety.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01957 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify strong cross-border property rights as a driver for the globalization of innovation. Using 67 million patents from over 100 patent offices, we construct novel measures of the three stages of innovation diffusion: adoption, sourcing, and collaboration. Exploiting staggered bilateral investment treaties (BITs) as shocks to cross-border property rights, we show that signatory countries increase technology adoption and sourcing from each other; they also increase R&amp;D collaborations. The results are particularly strong for countries with weak domestic institutions and technologies with high imitation risks. Increases in R&amp;D-related foreign investments explain most of the results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploring the minimum wage policy discontinuities at county borders, we find that minimum wage hikes induce industrial firms to pollute more and reduce their abatement efforts. State ownership mitigates these negative effects, suggesting its role in addressing externality. The adverse environmental impacts are attenuated by the staggered increase in pollution discharge fees across provinces. These effects are stronger for firms with higher minimum wage sensitivity, lower market power, and greater financial constraints, and for firms that are the subsidiaries of nonlisted companies. Overall, our findings highlight the unintended environmental consequences of labor market policies.</content>

    <title>Beyond Neoliberalism: The Role of Community in the Responsibilization of Citizen-Consumers During the Great Recession</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on governmentality theory, we examine the formation of responsibilized citizen-consumers during Ireland’s Great Recession (2008–2013). Through qualitative analysis of consumer interviews, media and political discourses, and macro consumer data, we advance understanding in governmentality and consumer responsibilization research by theorizing communal responsibilization as a distinct, culturally-embedded process. We contrast neoliberal and communal moral frames in responsibilizing citizen-consumers, and in this process of “shared responsibility,” we show how many citizen-consumers faced ideological, economic, and structural barriers to acting as self-reliant subjects. We find that communal frames and myths were particularly effective in alleviating some of these tensions by fostering relational interdependencies and communal solidarity, thus enabling the moral internalization of responsibility amongst citizen-consumers, both for themselves and others. We identify key mechanisms through which communities facilitated responsibilization and a re-casting of citizen-consumer subjectivities: social scaffolding, informal resource exchange, active citizenship, and communal entrepreneurship. Finally, we identify tensions and community disintegration as key barriers in the communal responsibilization process. Overall, our findings advance consumer research on responsibilization, consumption communities, and mythmaking.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can diversity lead to greater research focus on populations underrepresented in science? Between 1960 and 1990, 76 all-male US universities transitioned to coeducation. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design, we find that coeducation led to a 44 percent increase in gender-related research publications. This increase is driven by research focused on female subjects and gender differences. While coeducation led to a compositional shift with more women and researchers interested in gender topics, much of the increase comes from male incumbent researchers shifting their research focus toward gender-related topics. The results support interaction with more diverse students and peers as key underlying mechanisms. (JEL I23, J16, O31, O34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Children spend years in foster care, and bureaucratic hurdles can unnecessarily prolong their stays. The Mi Abogado program was introduced in Chile to enhance legal aid for foster children and accelerate family reunification. In a novel approach, the Chilean government randomized the introduction of the program for children living in institutions to evaluate effects on child well-being. Using registry data, we find the program significantly reduced the duration of foster care without increasing subsequent maltreatment and placements. The exposure also decreased criminal justice involvement and improved school attendance. Results suggest that strengthening foster care services can cost-effectively improve child well-being.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies, through a randomized field experiment involving community health workers in Pakistan, if public sector organizations can improve worker performance by investing in their mission motivation. The findings reveal that training aimed at strengthening mission motivation improves workers' performance in their core responsibility of monthly household visits, as well as in multiple tasks performed during and outside these visits. This holistic improvement in performance leads to improved health outcomes for children in the communities served by these workers. These results highlight the importance of promoting organizational missions as a strategy to improve public sector performance in low-income countries.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The US net foreign asset position declined sharply after 2007, reaching negative 60 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2023. This deterioration primarily reflects a US-specific rise in corporate asset values that inflated the value of US equity liabilities to the rest of the world. To interpret these trends, we develop an international macrofinance model of flows, stocks, asset valuations, the current account, and the net foreign asset position. We find that the welfare impact of rising asset values for a representative US household has been quite negative given extensive foreign ownership of US corporate equity.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes recognition of women's innovative ideas compared to men's using bibliometric data in economics, mathematics, and sociology. I establish similarities between papers to construct relevant counterfactual citations. On average, all-female papers receive 10 percent fewer citations than all-male papers, a disparity reduced by 40 percent when considering team sizes and disappearing in most fields with authors' publication records. Additionally, strong in-group preferences emerge: All-male teams omit more papers with women, and vice versa. Accounting for publication histories, female scholars are cited 0 percent (economics) to 11 percent (mathematics) less, with early-career women enduring a 9–14 percent citation penalty.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how a large increase in the price level is transmitted to the real economy through firm balance sheets. Using newly digitized macro- and micro-level data from the German inflation of 1919–1923, we show inflation led to a large reduction in real debt burdens and bankruptcies. Firms with higher nominal liabilities at the onset of inflation experienced a larger decline in interest expenses, a relative increase in their equity values, and higher employment during the inflation. The results are consistent with real effects of a debt-inflation channel that operates even when prices and wages are flexible. (JEL D22, E23, E31, G32, N14, N24)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model to study when an intermediate action can serve as a stepping stone that enables the elimination of a harmful norm. While the intermediate action may facilitate the first “step,” it may also become a new norm. We derive intuitive conditions for stepping stones, which depend on the relative size of social penalties and intrinsic utility benefits. We propose an econometric approach to testing whether an intermediate action is a stepping stone, and apply it to original data on female genital cutting in Somalia. The analysis shows that the intermediate action may become the new norm. (JEL I12, J16, O15, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment with US households to study how expectations about long-run home price growth shape spending decisions. We exogenously vary survey respondents' expectations by providing different expert forecasts. Homeowners' spending, measured using rich home-scanner data, is inelastic to home price expectations. By contrast, renters reduce their spending when expecting higher home price growth. These patterns reflect positive wealth effects for owners from higher future wealth and negative income effects for both groups due to higher future housing costs. Our study highlights consequences of asset price growth and long-term expectations about the economy for household behavior. (JEL C93, D12, D84, D91, G51, R31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Military spending has large and persistent effects on output because it shifts the composition of public spending toward R&amp;D. This boosts innovation and private investment in the medium term and increases productivity and GDP at longer horizons. Public R&amp;D expenditure stimulates economic activities beyond the business cycle even when it is not associated with war spending. In contrast, the effects of public investment are shorter-lived, while public consumption has a modest impact at most horizons. We reach these conclusions using BVAR with long lags and 125 years of US data, including newly reconstructed series of government spending by main categories since 1890.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interconnected agents such as firms in a supply chain make simultaneous preparatory investments to increase chances of honoring their respective bilateral agreements. Failures cascade with lasting repercussions further down the chain. How losses are shared affects how agents invest to avoid the losses in the first place. In this way, a solution sets agent liabilities depending on the point of disruption and induces a supermodular investment game. We characterize all efficient solutions. These have the form that later agents—who are not directly liable for the disruption—still shoulder some of the losses, justified on the premise that they might have failed anyway. Importantly, we find that such indirect liabilities are necessary to avoid unbounded inefficiencies. Finally, we pinpoint one efficient solution with several desirable properties.This paper was accepted by Peng Sun, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond [Grant 4260-00050B] and Carlsbergfondet [Grant CF18-1112].</content>

    <title>Market Design Choices, Racial Discrimination, and Equitable Microentrepreneurship in Digital Marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the potential of market design choices, specifically quality certification, to mitigate racial discrimination in digital marketplaces. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the discontinuity in Airbnb’s Superhost assignment, we find that Black hosts benefit 1.5 times more from the quality certification than other hosts. Moreover, we find compelling evidence that this disproportionate increase does not come at the expense of non-Superhost Black hosts. This suggests that quality certification can effectively reduce discrimination and promote equitable outcomes. Further, our analysis utilizing a doubly robust machine learning approach reveals that the effectiveness of quality certification persists even in the prominent presence of consumer reviews, a widely used market feature and a credible user-generated quality signal. Our research underscores the judicious use of market design in fostering equity for minority entrepreneurs in digital marketplaces.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01717 .</content>

    <title>Small worlds within global supply chains: implications for multinational enterprises’ environmental, social, and governance controversies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With increasing public attention to corporate sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) controversies emerging in global supply chains present a growing problem for multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper investigates whether MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers are more likely to be exposed to supplier-related ESG controversies. It also explores structural characteristics of global supply chains that can mitigate MNEs’ exposure to such controversies. Building on the literature on supply chain complexity and small-world networks, we suggest that the small-worldness of an MNE’s supply chain network can mitigate the impact of the geographical dispersion of suppliers on supplier-induced ESG controversies. Our analysis of the Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies from 2010 to 2019 reveals that MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers suffer from more supplier-induced ESG controversies, while small-worldness attenuates such impact. Our findings contribute to the international business literature by highlighting small-worldness as a network structural characteristic that can be deployed by MNEs to mitigate the negative impacts of supply chain spatial complexity.</content>

    <title>Real Effects of Non‐Streamlined Sales Tax Administration: Evidence from the Florida Hotel Industry</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether the local administration of sales taxes (as opposed to a more streamlined state administration) affects the real economy for businesses complying with the tax. We study this question in the Florida hotel industry, as counties in Florida can choose to locally administer the county‐level tourist tax or have the state administer the county‐level tax along with the state‐level tourist tax. Local administration is popular because it supports local employment (of tax administrators) and provides more stringent enforcement on non‐commercial operators (e.g., private rentals). State administration, however, has fewer compliance costs for hotels (e.g., reduced filings and fewer audits). Commentary from the profession suggests the incremental compliance costs of local administration can be considerable. We find that counties switching from state to local administration of tourist taxes is associated with slower growth in aggregate hotel payroll and employment, consistent with local tax administration increasing compliance costs to the point that affected businesses cut other services.</content>

    <title>From Smartphones to Smart Students: Learning vs. Distraction Using Smartphones in the Classroom</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study evaluates the impact of classroom smartphone use on student performance through two large-scale randomized controlled trials in China. Students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (i) smartphones banned, (ii) smartphones allowed and used at will without guidance, (iii) smartphones allowed with teacher prompts to use them for instruction, and (iv) smartphones banned with teachers prompting the use of paper-based aids. Our findings show that unstructured smartphone use reduced performance compared with banning them, whereas teacher-guided use significantly enhanced learning outcomes. Paper-based aids yielded no measurable performance gain over the ban. We analyzed classroom video recordings to track individual-level time spent in each condition. We found that students spent similar total time learning across conditions, but teacher-directed smartphone use produced disproportionately large marginal learning gains outweighing the losses from distraction. Guided use also helped close gender and performance gaps though it risked widening digital divides by major and region. These results suggest educators should receive support to develop purposeful, app-based smartphone instruction materials; policymakers should avoid blanket bans and instead adopt structured usage policies; and tech developers should design classroom-friendly tools aligned with instructional goals. With thoughtful implementation, smartphones can become engines of equity, positive engagement, and learning within the classroom.</content>

    <title>On-Demand Healthcare Platforms: Impact of Question and Answer Service on Online Consultations and Offline Appointments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand healthcare platforms are increasingly integrating low-cost question and answer (Q&amp;A) services to help patients navigate care options. Using data from a major Chinese health platform, this study shows that Q&amp;A services drive both online and offline engagement—boosting online consultations by 2%, offline appointments by 4.3%, and consultation revenue by 6.6%. These services not only encourage follow-ups with the same doctor but also, generate spillover demand to other providers and specialties, especially those with higher professional titles. Patients benefit through better provider matching, fewer revisits, and reduced time spent browsing for care—all of which suggest improved outcomes. Q&amp;A serves as an effective entry point, reducing uncertainty and guiding patients to the appropriate level of care. From an operational perspective, the service increases demand without cannibalizing higher-margin services, offering a low-cost lever for engagement and conversion. Platforms should incentivize generalists and junior doctors, who often serve as initial touchpoints and channel traffic to specialists, to maximize the broader impact of Q&amp;A engagement. For providers and policymakers, the findings highlight how lightweight, scalable tools, like Q&amp;A, can improve care access and coordination—especially in fragmented systems where patients select providers without formal referrals.</content>

    <title>Changing tracks: How status affects category shifts in the Korean popular music industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how producers' status shapes their strategies for category shifting of their artists. Unlike prior research emphasizing its limitations, we argue that in creative industries, category shifting can offer substantial advantages. Focusing on producer‐driven markets, we propose that middle‐status producers align artists with market‐dominant categories, while high‐status ones pursue periodic radical shifts. However, for female artists, producers' influence on category shifts is constrained by audience expectations rooted in stricter institutional gender norms. Using a unique dataset from the Korean popular music industry, we find support for our hypotheses. We show that entertainment agencies' status influences the category‐shifting behaviors of idol groups. Yet, the impact of producer status is moderated by the broader gender expectations in which the artists are embedded.Managerial SummaryThis study explores how producers' status influences their approach to positioning their artists within existing market categories. Contrary to previous views focusing largely on limitations, we argue that category shifting in creative industries can bring significant benefits. In markets where producers drive the creative process, we suggest that those with moderate status tend to shift to follow popular categories, while high‐status ones opt for more radical changes. However, female artists face tighter constraints due to institutional norms. Drawing from data in the Korean popular music industry, we find evidence supporting our theory. We demonstrate how the status of entertainment agencies affects the category shifts of idol groups, though this effect is limited by broader gender expectations surrounding the artists.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In four large online experiments, we study how investors assess the relationship between stock portfolios and the market. Participants select or are randomly assigned a portfolio of stocks from a market index. They state portfolio return expectations conditional on different market outcomes, revealing implied beliefs about portfolio beta. We find general underestimation of beta which is stronger for downside beta. This asymmetry is amplified for participants who select their portfolio. They believe their portfolio goes up with the market but does not come down with it. We confirm biased beliefs about beta with financial professionals, monetary incentives, and alternative belief elicitation methods.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Seat Selection Surcharge and Allocation Policy in Selling High-Speed Train Tickets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a dynamic capacity control problem with seat selection and dynamic surcharge in the railway industry. In such problems, passenger arrives with a request for an itinerary, having a seat preference and a certain willingness-to-pay for seat preference. The decision-maker needs to decide at each time period whether to open each itinerary, a surcharge for each seat type in each open itinerary, and a seat assignment for each accepted request. The distinguishing feature of this problem is that the seat assignment decision is closely related to the surcharge decision — if the passenger chooses to pay the surcharge, then we must assign him/her a seat of preference, otherwise we can assign the passenger any seat on the train. Moreover, each accepted passenger must be assigned to a unique seat throughout the journey and it is not allowed to use a combination of seats to serve a passenger.We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem involving seat allocation and dynamic surcharge pricing. We consider a static problem in which demands of all requests are known but their arrival periods are unknown, and introduce a set of assignment consistency constraints to ensure the feasibility of opening and surcharge decisions when willingness-to-pay is uncertain. We then propose dynamic policies based on the static problem. In particular, we propose a booking limit control policy, two bid-price control policies and a re-solving a dynamic primal policy, and study the asymptotic loss of these policies. We also conduct numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of proposed policies and the potential gain of setting dynamic surcharges.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving Health Outcomes with Less Cost? Provision of Mobile Clinic in Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a public healthcare system consisting of a hospital, a mobile clinic (MC), and a population of potential patients. The government is concerned about the system’s healthcare spending and the population’s health outcomes. It decides the frequency and capacity of the MC service to maximize the social welfare that consists of two terms: the system’s long-run average healthcare cost and the population’s average quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We characterize the population’s natural disease progression using a Markov cohort model and derive the average healthcare cost incurred for the system and the average QALY in closed form for a given MC service. We show that the government is more likely to provide the MC service when (i) it puts more weight on the population’s average QALY, (ii) the MC treatment becomes more efficient, or (iii) the hospital treatment cost is much higher relative to the MC treatment cost. We further show that when conditions (ii) and (iii) are met or the disease progresses faster, the provision of the MC service is more likely to result in a win-win outcome, leading to both healthcare cost reduction and QALY improvement. The optimal MC delivery policy highly hinges on the disease’s progressive speed. Specifically, when the MC service is designated to serve a specific target population, once the MC service is provided, it shall be provided either every period or every other period if the disease is fast-progressive. If the disease is slow-progressive, the long-run average healthcare cost exhibits a zigzag pattern with the MC delivery cycle when the relative treatment cost-saving per person induced by the provision of the MC service is positive. Last, we conduct a real case study. Our analysis reveals that the optimal implementation of the MC program results in a 119.5% improvement in QALY and a 5% reduction in healthcare costs. The results are robust in probabilistic sensitivity analysis with a relative performance gap within 11.5% when factoring in uncertainty of the parameters.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Transaction Fee Mechanisms and User Welfare in Permissionless Blockchains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transaction fee is fundamental in maintaining the stability and decentralization of a permissionless blockchain, the infrastructure underlying major cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. This fee, set and paid by users when initiating each transaction, aggregates to over $24 million daily on Ethereum, imposing a non-trivial barrier to wider adoption. What is worse is that it is disproportionately borne by small users. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum started with a name-your-own-price style fee mechanism. Under this Legacy mechanism, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, only three-quarters of the transaction fee is necessary for users to attain the service quality they receive; the remaining one-quarter thus constitutes welfare loss. In August 2021, Ethereum implemented a fee mechanism change. Together, the Legacy methods and the new scheme, which we call Cap-Tip, describe the two most widely used fee mechanisms in all major permissionless blockchains. We explain the innovations embedded in the Cap-Tip mechanism through the lens of information quality and task decomposition. Collecting over 123 million transactions covering the change period, we estimate the causal impact of Cap-Tip on welfare improvement using a doubly robust difference-in-difference estimator that accommodates heterogeneity across timing of and exposure after adoption. The result is an astounding 80% reduction in welfare loss, achieved by users only six days after adoption. Interestingly, we also find that adoption benefits small users more than large ones, alleviating fee disparity and improving fairness. We theorize this difference through user experience and the overconfidence bias. Our study offers a novel operational perspective to unpack how the arguably most significant fee mechanism change in the blockchain space affects user welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stabilize the Dual Value and Alleviate the Primal Degeneracy of Linear Programs SimultaneouslyDual-optimal and deep dual-optimal inequalities (DOIs/DDOIs) are known to aid dual stabilization and accelerate convergence. In “Nested Set-Covering/Packing Problem: Degeneracy Alleviation and Dual Stabilization,” Siqi Guo, Fan Xiao, and Zhe Liang observe that DOIs/DDOIs also increase primal degeneracy, thereby extra effort is needed to prove optimality. Therefore, when addressing linear programs, it is critical to stabilize the dual as well as reduce primal degeneracy. This paper studies a nested multistage set-covering problem and proposes a nested set-covering model, which can be viewed as a traditional set-covering problem with special DDOIs. The authors derive strengthened reduced costs that can prescreen and prune degenerate variables and a pruning-and-pricing mechanism that utilizes both standard and strengthened reduced costs to price out promising variables. An efficient nested column-and-row generation algorithm is developed to exploit the benefits of both dual stabilization and degeneracy alleviation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Middle-Mile E-Commerce Order FulfillmentIn “E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Problem with Limited Time Window,” Zhou, Gümüş, and Miao investigate how online retailers can improve order fulfillment by utilizing the limited fulfillment window in middle-mile logistics. The authors first characterize an optimal policy and then, introduce two simple heuristic approaches for fulfillment decisions based on Lagrangian relaxation. They show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal when the number of demand locations increases. They also discover that integrating the information about remaining fulfillment windows into the decision-making process can yield additional benefits. Their findings suggest that online retailers can gain a competitive advantage by offering customers options, such as a “two-day fulfillment” service instead of a “same-day fulfillment” service, particularly when faced with limited logistical capacities.</content>

    <title>Does Privacy Regulation Harm Content Providers? A Longitudinal Analysis of the Impact of the GDPR</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns that the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would adversely affect the ability of news and media websites to create new quality content have not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. We construct a longitudinal data set of European Union (EU) and U.S. news and media websites to study how online content providers responded to the GDPR over time and whether potential restrictions on online tracking enforced by the regulation affected their downstream outcomes. We find robust evidence that both EU and U.S. news and media websites responded to the regulation by altering their data collection practices, but did so differently, with EU websites reducing tracking and implementing consent mechanisms at higher rates than their U.S. counterparts. Although we detect a reduction in average page views per user on EU relative to U.S. websites, we do not find evidence of negative impacts, in both the short and long term, on EU websites’ provision of new content or on several proxies for quality of that content, such as social media engagement metrics, various traffic measures, and articles’ text analytics. We also find no evidence of differences in survival rates across EU and U.S. news and media websites, and no evidence that monetization strategies changed at higher rates on EU relative to U.S. websites. The analysis suggests that EU online content providers did implement changes to their data collection practices in response to the GDPR but were able to use data minimization and consent mechanism strategies that allowed them to keep producing content and engage audiences at degrees on par with their U.S. counterparts.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What influences consumers to make product decisions alone versus with household partners? This research examines how consumers’ preference for solo or joint decision-making with household partners varies between product acquisition and disposal stages. Ten pre-registered studies demonstrate that for many household products, consumers are more likely to choose joint (vs. solo) decision-making with household partners for disposal than for acquisition. This asymmetry occurs because disposal (vs. acquisition) increases perceptions of the potential for infringement on a household partner’s rights, which increases the desire for clarity about a partner’s product valuation and thus the choice of joint (vs. solo) decision-making with one’s partner. The authors identify three process-consistent boundary conditions, wherein this acquisition-disposal asymmetry is mitigated: (1) when the product cannot be used by one’s partner, (2) when considering decisions with non-household members (e.g., non-cohabitating close friends) instead of one’s household partner, and (3) when the product’s price exceeds the household’s typical budget. Moreover, the authors discuss implications of this acquisition-disposal asymmetry for consumer well-being and marketing strategies, including its potential to cause delays in disposal decisions relative to acquisition decisions. This research contributes to understanding household decision dynamics and identifies a novel contributor to overaccumulation of household products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Package weight and calorie judgments play an important role in food-related consumer decisions. In this paper, the authors hypothesize and demonstrate that the bi-directional relationship between package stability and objective weight leads consumers to perceive visually more stable shapes as subjectively heavier: the “shape stability effect” (Study 1). The stability effect is mitigated (replicated) when the context makes volume (weight) judgments more accessible than weight (volume) judgments (Study 2). The shape stability effect has consequences for calorie perceptions (Study 3A) and consumption decisions (Study 3B). We also examined the implications for consumers’ WTP (Study 4A). Analysis of an archival data set (Study 4B) shows that for tasty (healthy) products, price is positively (negatively) associated with shape stability. Theoretically, these results add to the literature on volume and weight judgments, and calorie perceptions. Managerial implications for food packaging and positioning are offered.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion individuals worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to credit due to the absence of traditional credit scores. In this paper, we demonstrate how retail transaction data can be used to construct an alternative credit score, potentially expanding credit access for these individuals. Our study utilizes a unique dataset obtained through a partnership with a Peruvian company. We merge customer loyalty data and credit card repayment data with administrative records from the Peruvian financial system, which provide detailed financial histories of individuals. This comprehensive dataset allows us to construct credit scores for individuals both with and without a credit history. Through simulations of credit card approval decisions, we find that incorporating retail data increases approval rates for individuals without a credit history, from 16% to between 31% and 48%. In contrast, for those with an established credit history, approval rates remain largely unchanged at around 88%. We investigate why retail data particularly benefits individuals without a credit history and discuss the broader implications of this credit scoring methodology for consumers, firms, and policymakers. Our findings highlight its potential to transform credit access for millions of previously unbanked individuals.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms facilitate exchanges between platform actors, such as trading between buyers and sellers. However, providers of digital platforms also compete with other actors, referred to as third parties, on their own platforms. In such settings,self-preferencingcan occur if the platform treats its own offerings better than comparable third-party offerings—a practice often deemed inappropriate. However, detecting self-preferencing is challenging. This article addresses this challenge conceptually and empirically by putting forward a conceptual framework that defines self-preferencing and conceptualizes two self-preferencing tests. It implements this framework empirically in two studies across three international Amazon marketplaces using a novel metric to measure a product’s non-personalized visibility. The aggregate findings provide little evidence for self-preferencing in both studies. However, the more disaggregated findings at a country- and product category-level vary from weak self-preferencing to strong self-depreferencing. As implementing self-preferencing tests requires researchers to choose between several empirical alternatives and assumptions, the approach proposed herein includes extensive sensitivity, specification curve, and heterogeneity analyses whose results support the robustness of the findings.</content>

    <title>Gaining Career Purpose Through Lightning Bolts: Examining the Strength and Psychological Foundations of Work-Related Epiphanies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Epiphanies—sudden realizations that transform how people see themselves—have the potential to infuse people’s personal and professional lives with a renewed sense of purpose. Yet, the prominence and potency of epiphanies as purpose-giving vehicles has largely been overlooked in management and organization studies. In the research reported here, we investigate epiphanies and their psychological foundations. Specifically, we build and test theory on what types of individuals, psychologically speaking, are more likely to experience epiphanies of greater strength related to their work and careers. We evaluate the strength of the work-related epiphanies that people experienced over the course of their lives (Study 1) and in the context of a leadership development program (Study 2) and a leadership coaching workshop (Study 3). Consistent with our theorizing, we find that people who engage in a form of mind wandering known as “problem-solving daydreaming” are more likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength. Furthermore, we find that people who engage in problem-solving daydreaming are especially likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength when they possess a form of curiosity that compels them to solve their problems (“deprivation sensitivity”). Work-related epiphany strength, in turn, transmits this conditional effect onto people’s sense of purpose in their careers via psychological tension resolution. These results illuminate psychological phenomena underlying sudden shifts in how people view themselves and open new windows into how a heightened sense of career purpose can emerge among individuals on a managerial career path.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change poses significant global challenges to multinational enterprises (MNEs). One crucial solution hinges on the development of new technologies to mitigate climate change or adapt to its adverse effects. However, it remains unclear what factors can effectively motivate MNEs’ development of climate innovation. Integrating the resource dependence theory and the natural resource-based view, we argue that MNEs’ strategies are shaped by their dependence on the global ecological environment for natural resources—coined here asglobal ecological dependence. When exposed to elevated climate risks, MNEs tend to engage in climate innovation to assuage the uncertainty associated with their global ecological dependence. This tendency is moderated by climate-related formal and informal institutions that alter the perceived benefits and costs of climate innovation: stringent regulatory demand for climate action weakens this tendency as it increases firm costs and can divert resources, whereas heightened societal demand enhances this tendency as it can increase MNEs’ perception of the benefits of climate innovation. We find evidence for our hypotheses in a panel of MNEs listed in the United States from 1995 to 2017. Our study contributes to resource dependence theory and extends our understanding of climate innovation as a viable solution to climate change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the effects of a blockchain-based environmental monitoring technology on emissions. Our model of firm competition in the presence of regional regulators reveals that blockchain adoption reduces industrial pollution but triggers business relocation, creating trade-offs between local emission reduction and economic contraction. When pollution-induced social losses are highly dispersed across cities, a partial-adoption equilibrium fails to mitigate aggregate emissions because of the pollution leakage. We further present the first piece of empirical evidence corroborating model predictions, by taking advantage of a recent regulation change in China. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, and CO in blockchain-adopting cities are on average 16.6%, 7.9% and 4.6%, respectively, lower than other cities. However, blockchain-based monitoring disproportionately hurts the industrial sector, and the average economic activities is reduced by 1.8%-2.6%. Firms in adopting cities open more non-local plants to avoid regulation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Community participation is recognized as a crucial yet problematic element for addressing many issues in social development. Generating participation, however, is particularly challenging due to existing inequalities within heterogeneous communities, making it difficult for organizations to engage marginalized groups while letting go of their own control. We explore how organizations facilitate community participation through a qualitative comparative case study of two community radio stations in India. We find two approaches based on how organizations leverage three levels of influence: (1)open participation workleverages community members as audience and volunteers/staff by drawing on commonality between them. Furthermore, it defers decision making to community hierarchy; (2)protective participation workengages audience and volunteers/staff from marginalized groups, focusing on their differences from other community members, and defies community hierarchy in decision making. These two approaches led to contrasting outcomes: open participation work led to a pliable organization that invited the community in, but preserved community inequalities, and protective participation work led to a directive organization that restricted participation, but disrupted community inequalities. In unpacking these approaches, we extend the social‐symbolic work literature by theorizing how participation work creates entangled effects on the organization and community.</content>

    <title>What If We Are the WEIRD Ones? A Call (and Roadmap) for More Non-WEIRD Entrepreneurship Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship researchers have focused on WEIRD samples—that is, Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic samples. This editorial suggests that not all theories formed on and tested with WEIRD samples are generalizable to non-WEIRD contexts. A richer picture of entrepreneurial phenomena can come from non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research, especially (but not exclusively) by non-WEIRD researchers with local knowledge and interests. In this editorial, we hope to motivate more non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research by highlighting the potential problems with the dominance of a WEIRD perspective in our most impactful research, introducing each element of a non-WEIRD approach to solve those problems, and offering some big-picture thoughts and methods as future research opportunities. Indeed, we provide research opportunities that could lead to contextualized entrepreneurship theories embedded in contexts not well represented in the mainstream entrepreneurship literature, largely devoted to the WEIRD. We conclude this editorial with recommendations for reviewers and editors of these mainstream entrepreneurship journals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an agenda setting seminar in 1997, when entrepreneurship was just emerging as a serious field of scholarship, Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow offered a challenging null hypothesis, namely, that entrepreneurship being a stochastic phenomenon, educational content is unlikely to make a difference in startup rates or success thereafter. With a view to begin tackling this null, we utilize a nationwide educational reform as a quasi‐experiment to investigate the effect of business and entrepreneurship‐oriented education on (i) early age startup (i.e., direct effects) and (ii) postgraduation choices that may lead to startup activity later (i.e., indirect effects). We find evidence for positive direct and indirect effects and discuss implications for future research into the design of entrepreneurship education policies as well as content and teacher training.Managerial SummaryA variety of entrepreneurship programs exist at prestigious universities to stimulate startup for students who enroll in these based on entrepreneurial preferences and intentions. The resulting new ventures created are important drivers of innovation, economic growth, and job creation. Our study indicates that exposure to business and entrepreneurship content at an earlier age is equally important. Both in terms of obtaining a realistic insight into entrepreneurship as a career, leading to more realized startups of high quality but also in terms of developing a preference for entrepreneurship affecting subsequent choices regarding tertiary education and employment in favor of future entrepreneurship. We suggest investments in broadening entrepreneurship education for all in contrast to for specific targeted groups such as university or technology entrepreneurs.</content>

    <title>The signal of institutional governance in early‐stage financing for university spinoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;University spinoffs (USOs) translate scientific advancement to economic gains, but the role of the university's governance as a public or private institution is infrequently explored. With a novel dataset of academic entrepreneurs with National Science Foundation I‐Corps training, we examine institutional governance as a fundraising signal. We demonstrate how angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) show a preference for private USOs. However, with different investment objectives, the groups conduct distinct sensemaking that weighs this cue differently. For angels, industry moderates the effect such that they prefer private university life science firms to public USOs. However, industry mediates the effect for VCs, who prefer life sciences to engineering. We describe this variation as mixed salience—when a signal yields differences in decision‐making for distinct audiences.Managerial SummaryUniversity spinoffs (USOs) are important for economic growth, but little is known about differences between USOs from public and private universities. We study how angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) fund USOs of public and private schools. These two investor groups make funding decisions with different priorities and approaches. Both groups appear to prefer private universities. A deeper look reveals that angel investors prefer private university life science teams to the public university counterparts. On the other hand, VCs prefer life sciences teams to engineering teams—and life sciences teams are more likely to come from private schools. Evidently, the two investor audiences respond to the public/private distinction in different ways.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the infrastructure of decentralized exchanges subjects liquidity providers (LPs) to a “tragedy of the commons.” Liquidity providers lack incentives to exit liquidity pools to prevent arbitrage losses, as these are collectively shared, while withdrawal costs are borne individually. Arbitrage rents primarily flow to validators as infrastructure fees, with the median arbitrageur transferring 96% of profits. Proposed solutions—speed technology, alternative sequencing rules, and flexible pricing curves—fail to reduce these rents. Leveraging the Silicon Valley Bank crisis as a natural experiment, we show that LPs defensively adopt more convex pricing curves to mitigate adverse selection risks.</content>

    <title>Π-CAPM: The Classical CAPM with Probability Weighting and Skewed Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new asset pricing model that generalizes the mean-variance framework by including probability weighting, specifically the overweighting of rare, high-impact events. Our model—the Π-CAPM—generates several new predictions: (i) skewness has a positive price effect, amplified by volatility; (ii) the price effect of volatility is negative for left-skewed assets but positive for right-skewed assets; and (iii) option-implied variance premiums for stocks have a U-shaped relation to skewness, amplified by volatility. We find strong empirical support for these predictions. Finally, we show that the Π-CAPM predicts an exaggerated co-movement of assets and can explain the correlation premium.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use publicly available information to estimate the country location of multinational firms’ cash holdings, examine why investors discount the value of cash held overseas, and examine whether that discount changes after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. We provide three main results. First, our firm-year foreign cash estimates are reasonably accurate, evidenced by high correlations with simulated data and proprietary country-level data, high adjusted R2when explaining a firm’s total cash holdings, and the ability to replicate prior findings. Second, we demonstrate that investors value foreign cash holdings more negatively than domestic cash holdings when the cash is held in high agency-cost countries. Finally, we find that investors no longer appear to discount foreign cash after the TCJA, when the U.S. moved from a worldwide to a quasi-territorial taxation system.</content>

    <title>CFO narcissism and the power of persuasion over analysts: a mixed-methods approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of CFO narcissism in the intent and ability to positively influence sell-side analysts’ perceptions of the firm. Consistent with narcissists casting favorable impressions on others, we find CFO narcissism is associated with overly optimistic analyst valuations. We then study public persuasion attempts by analyzing conference call transcripts and private persuasion attempts through a laboratory study. In the conference call setting, we show that narcissistic CFOs use more persuasive language and are more inclined to call on bearish analysts, both of which we link to price target revisions following the call. In the lab study, we simulate a one-on-one conversation and find that narcissists are especially more likely to use coercive methods to induce higher valuations from analysts. Collectively, we show that narcissistic CFOs use persuasion to favorably influence analysts’ perceptions of firm value.</content>

    <title>Carbon Emissions, Mutual Fund Trading, and the Liquidity of Corporate Bonds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the effect of climate risks on corporate bond mutual funds’ trading activities and explores its mechanism. We find that investor flows negatively respond to mutual funds’ carbon exposure, using the Paris Agreement as a shock event. Such carbon-induced redemptions prompt mutual funds to sell bonds issued by high-carbon companies, especially for funds with high outflow-to-carbon sensitivity. Our findings do not support the alternative hypothesis that a fundamental shift in funds’ investment preferences drives the reduction in high-carbon holdings. Finally, we document a deterioration in the liquidity of high-carbon bonds, particularly those heavily owned by mutual funds.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between temperature changes and firm performance using a novel time-varying measure of firm-level temperature sensitivity. We find that firms with higher temperature sensitivity have lower future profitability and riskier corporate policies. These firms are also overpriced and earn lower average future returns as market participants are slow to correct the mispricing. Nonlocal institutional investors allocate higher portfolio weights to firms with high temperature sensitivity, and sell-side equity analyst forecasts are less accurate for these firms. Together, these results suggest that financial markets underreact to information about firm-level temperature sensitivity, and this generates predictable patterns in returns. A trading strategy that exploits this mispricing generates an annualized risk-adjusted return of more than 4% during the 1968–2020 period.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00972 .</content>

    <title>Mitigating Exposure Bias for Recommendations in Physical Spaces: An Unbiased Pairwise Ranking Approach Using Spatial Movement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the remarkable success of personalized recommendations on digital platforms, brick-and-mortar businesses are increasingly exploring artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommendation services in physical spaces. To address this emerging need, our study introduces a generalized recommendation problem, termed point-of-interest (POI) recommendations in physical spaces with pedestrian movement (P3M). Applicable scenarios for P3M include store recommendations in shopping malls, product shelf recommendations in hypermarkets, and so on. A critical impediment in P3M is exposure bias: When the exposure likelihood of items to users is unevenly distributed, indiscriminately treating all unobserved interactions as negative feedback introduces bias to the learning of recommender systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel recommendation method, unbiased movement-aware pairwise ranking (UMPR), which integrates pedestrian movement modeling with unbiased pairwise learning to achieve effective and unbiased recommendations. Using real-world shopping mall data, we demonstrate that UMPR not only delivers more accurate recommendations compared to state-of-the-art methods but also brings added monetary value for mall owners and promotes humanistic fairness across store tenants. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of mitigating exposure bias through pedestrian movement modeling, advancing the field of recommendations in physical spaces.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We first document that, despite potential legal issues, overlapping directors are surprisingly prevalent among direct competitors. Using panel data regressions and plausibly exogenous shocks, we find that competing firms in markets with dense overlapping-director networks experience innovation herding, lose product differentiation, and, ultimately, perform poorly. Novel text-based network propagation tests of technologies show that intellectual property leakage plays a role as firms with dense overlapping director networks experience faster propagation of technologies to competitors. Our findings suggest a coordination problem where industry participants cannot stop rivals from earning small gains from leakage despite much larger industry-wide negative externalities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should the seller display all available products in a setting with multiple products or only offer a subset? Is there a benefit of withholding some products? The seller does not want to display low-margin products due to cannibalization, but what if all products have the same margin? In “Performance of the Offer-Everything Policy,” W. T. Huh, J. Paat, and M. Queyranne argue that in an environment where the seller cannot adjust assortment based on customer types, it is best to offer all available products in an environment. The analysis is based on competitive ratio and expected revenue. This research assures that a common practice of truthfully revealing product availability is a generally good policy to follow.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although experimental design often focuses on selecting the single best alternative from a finite set, many pure-exploration problems pursue richer goals. Given a specific goal, adaptive experimentation aims to achieve it by strategically allocating sampling effort, with the underlying sample complexity characterized by a maximin optimization problem. In "Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration," Qin and You introduce a unified dual-directed framework for efficiently solving general pure-exploration problems, yielding a unified algorithm design principle that extends the top-two approach beyond best-arm identification. Their theoretical analysis proves asymptotic optimality for classical problems, such as Gaussian best-arm identification, thresholding bandits, and epsilon-best-arm identification. Extensive numerical experiments confirm these theoretical insights, showcasing significant improvements over existing methods. This dual-directed framework offers researchers and practitioners a powerful and versatile tool to navigate uncertainty and optimize exploration strategies effectively.</content>

    <title>A Separation of Utility and Beliefs Through Betting Consistency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For standard preferences under uncertainty, minimal requirements are proposed to identify cardinal utility and subjective, potentially nonadditive, beliefs. This is achieved through an application of betting consistency. This preference principle says that outcome midpoints derived from preferences over bets on an event are also midpoints when elicited from bets on a different event. This consistency requirement provides a simplified elicitation tool, while it also serves as a robustness test for utility measurements. An analyst can use betting consistency to identify a client’s cardinal utility index independent of the client’s beliefs. This follows from our simplified foundation for the biseparable utility model, the widely adopted framework for empirical measurements of utility under various sources of uncertainty. As a theoretical tool, betting consistency can be adopted to provide simple and intuitive foundations for new and for existing decision theories. For instance, an event-dependent version of betting consistency, if it is supplemented with Savage’s sure-thing principle or a version of that principle restricted to acts that satisfy Schmeidler’s comonotonicity property, delivers subjective expected utility or Choquet expected utility, as desired. We also demonstrate how models with specific nonadditive beliefs can easily be derived through bespoke formulations of betting consistency.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>Tending to the Particular: Navigating Tensions Around Principles of Alternativity Through an Ethics of Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alternative organizations must continuously address conflicts that emerge regarding diverging prioritizations and interpretations of autonomy, solidarity, and responsibility. We explore how tensions around alternative moral principles can be navigated through relational processes that attune to others' needs, emotions, and concerns. Building on an organizational ethnography of a cooperative campaign agency, we mobilize ethics of care as a research lens to trace and analyse how relational activities that are infused by an ethical attention to particular others assist the organization in dealing with these tensions. Our findings show that three relational activities – inquiring, deliberating, and responding – constitute a “relational tension‐navigation circuit” that enables the alternative organization to evoke, map, and situatively settle tensions around alternative principles by embracing the vulnerability, plurality, and flourishing of others. We contribute to relational, ethical, and processual research in alternative organizing by showing how the particular and the general can be productively enfolded in alternative organizations. Furthermore, we conceptualize a broad, ethically and relationally grounded understanding of revisability that supports alternative organizations in finding targeted adaptations and provisional solutions to address conflicts and tensions.</content>

    <title>When do Firms with New CEOs Engage in M&amp;amp;A? Understanding the Timing of New CEOs' First M&amp;amp;A Announcements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New CEO appointments can create strategic uncertainty for stakeholders, potentially undermining the CEO's position. While the stakeholder uncertainty perspective suggests CEOs may act boldly to clarify their strategic intentions during early tenure, the CEO life cycle perspective proposes that CEOs avoid such moves during early tenure, as they still need to learn. This study integrates these views to examine whether and when new CEOs under high strategic uncertainty make bold strategic choices during early tenure. Focusing on first acquisitions – especially large and cross‐border deals – we argue that new CEOs have a higher hazard of announcing an acquisition under high strategic uncertainty, namely, outsider CEOs and those whose appointments were more negatively received. Leveraging the time CEOs spend in their role as a conceptual bridge between the two perspectives, we argue that the acquisition hazard under high strategic uncertainty increases over early tenure, as CEOs gather information and learn. Analysing 873 new US CEOs (2004–2020) with an extended Cox hazard model, we find a generally higher hazard of first acquisition announcements for outsider CEOs and those with more negative appointment reactions, especially for bolder deals. Evidence on time dependence is mixed, but more pronounced for outsider CEOs and large acquisitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose CTREND, a new trend factor for cryptocurrency returns, which aggregates price and volume information across different time horizons. Using data on more than 3,000 coins, we employ machine learning methods to exploit information from various technical indicators. The resulting signal reliably predicts cryptocurrency returns. The effect cannot be subsumed by known factors and remains robust across different subperiods, market states, and alternative research designs. Moreover, it survives the impact of transaction costs and persists in big and liquid coins. Finally, an asset pricing model that incorporates CTREND outperforms competing factor models, providing a superior explanation of cryptocurrency returns.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates (1) whether misreporting by corporate executives impacts unethical decision‐making by non‐peers in unrelated reporting tasks, and (2) whether observing various forms of punishment for corporate misreporting deters this spillover effect. Specifically, we examine the deterrent effects of two common forms of punishment (fines or imprisonment) and a novel form of punishment (public shaming). Across two experiments, we find that participants are more likely to misreport performance when exposed to media reports about executives engaging in financial misreporting. This evidence is consistent with executive misreporting leading to unethical decision‐making among non‐peer observers. We also find that participant misreporting is reduced when the media reports the punishments levied against those executives. In further mediation tests, our findings suggest observed punishments for corporate misconduct can influence perceptions of injunctive norms and potentially mitigate spillover in unethical behavior.</content>

    <title>Signaling Quality to Consumers: The Role of Social Media Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly turning to social media marketing to boost product visibility and spread consumer-generated content, which often reveals valuable information about product quality. However, our research shows that this dual role can backfire; heavy spending on social media marketing may no longer help high-quality firms stand out. Instead of investing heavily to reach a broad audience, high-quality firms may do better by cutting back and focusing on targeted niche markets. Furthermore, as consumers become more capable of discerning product quality through social media content, low- and medium-quality firms benefit less from mimicking one another. This creates stronger incentives for lower-quality firms to mimic the high-quality firm, which increases consumer confusion and weakens the quality signal conveyed through investment in social media marketing. These findings help explain the variation in firms’ social media marketing strategies and offer practical guidance on allocating social media budgets more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I document a significant gender gap in entrepreneurs’ access to early-stage equity financing. Using unique administrative data on French startups, I show that this gap is particularly pronounced in male-dominated sectors. Controlling for a comprehensive set of entrepreneur and startup characteristics—including demographics, backgrounds, and motivations—accounts for 42% of the average gender gap. However, in male-dominated sectors, 80% of the gap remains unexplained. Growth-oriented female entrepreneurs rely more heavily on bank loans, substituting equity with debt. Finally, VC-backed female-founded startups outperform their male counterparts in male-dominated sectors. These findings suggest that context-dependent stereotypes influence equity financing decisions. (JEL G24, G41, J16, L26)</content>

    <title>Getting to the Core: Inflation Risks Within and Across Asset Classes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do real assets protect against inflation? Stocks’ core inflation betas are negative, while their energy betas are positive. Currencies, commodities, and real estate mostly hedge against energy inflation, but not core inflation. These hedging properties are reflected in the prices of inflation risks: only core inflation carries a negative risk premium, and its magnitude is consistent within and across asset classes, uniquely among macroeconomic risk factors. Energy inflation has become more procyclical and volatile since the 1990s, which helps explain the time-varying correlation between stock and bond returns. A two-sector New Keynesian asset pricing model accounts for these facts quantitatively. (JEL E31, G11, G12)</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Effectiveness of Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Chinese Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global shift from face-to-face instruction to online learning, posing new operational challenges for business schools, particularly in equipping students with quantitative skills essential for the labor market. Leveraging China’s abrupt lockdown policies as a natural experiment, we examine the heterogeneous effects of online education on student academic performance. Using a panel dataset of 15,329 observations from 7,867 undergraduate students across nine Chinese universities over four semesters (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), we compare academic outcomes before and during the transition to online learning. We find that online education led to an average increase of 8 to 11 points in mathematics scores on a 100-point scale during the pandemic. Applying principal component analysis, we identify four key policy measures that capture lockdown stringency: stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, public transportation suspension, and public information campaigns. Stricter stay-at-home orders issued by the government reduce the effectiveness of online learning; however, these negative effects are partially offset by increased parental supervision and reduced external distractions resulting from workplace closures and the suspension of public transportation. Further, online learning is more effective for reasoning-focused courses (e.g., mathematics) than interpretation-focused courses (e.g., English), and the academic benefits of face-to-face peer interactions diminish significantly in online settings relative to offline environments. Our findings offer actionable insights for managing educational delivery during operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of tailoring online curriculum design and support systems to course content and student mobility constraints.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Consistency in Service Delivery: Examining the Effect of Process Standardization on Hospital Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare services provided to patients with similar medical conditions are known to vary. Standardization of healthcare delivery is a relatively new, yet hotly debated approach to address clinical variations. Previous research on process standardization in health service delivery has focused on measuring adherence to established protocols available only for a limited set of medical conditions. We create an alternate construct that quantifies process standardization measured in terms of consistency in services rendered, and apply it in a healthcare context using detailed nonpublic inpatient discharge data from about 35 million inpatient stays at acute care hospitals in California between 2008-2016. We examine the impact of such process standardization on the cost, quality, and variation in quality of care delivered at the hospital, operating unit, and medical condition level. We find that process standardization is associated with reductions in cost per discharge, readmission rate and variation in readmission rates at the hospital level. We also find that the impact of process standardization varies across different operating units and medical conditions, providing cost and quality benefit in majority of cases. We further conduct post-hoc analysis on the degree of process standardization, finding that higher rates of capacity utilization and complexity of patient disease mix is associated with a lower process standardization, while increasing focus and process adherence is associated with an increase in process standardization.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Imperative vs. Linguistic Alignment: Organizations Use Language to Modify Environmental Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Analysis on how organizations and the environment interact starts with the common assumption that mutual understanding and agreement are beneficial for organizations. The process of building such an agreement and the consequences of agreement versus disagreement are an active research topic and one that calls for additional research. We add evidence to this debate by performing a replication of the initial findings on the costs of category spanning. We also introduce the concept of linguistic alignment, defined as the intersection of organizational self-description and environmental understanding of the organization. We specify a measurement strategy for linguistic alignment and test the implications of linguistic alignment of U.S. public firms and securities analysts over the last two decades with a novel embedding alignment technique. We find that firm values are reduced when spanning categories, but linguistic alignment is a better predictor of firm value. In addition to this direct effect, linguistic alignment reduces the value reduction of firms with a multi-industry presence. This means that organizations that can manage their self-presentation to achieve linguistic alignment with external audience analysts to obtain better evaluations.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Science Research Council [SICSS Research Grant] and the National Science Foundation Division of Social and Economic Sciences [Grant SES-1236931].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19341 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimization problems with discrete decisions are nonconvex and thus lack strong duality, which limits the usefulness of tools such as shadow prices. It was shown in Burer (2009) that mixed-binary quadratic programs can be written as completely positive programs, which are convex. We apply this perspective by writing unit commitment in power systems as a completely positive program and then using the dual copositive program and strong duality to design new pricing mechanisms. We show that the mechanisms are revenue-adequate and, under certain conditions, support a market equilibrium. To facilitate implementation, we also employ a cutting plane algorithm for solving copositive programs exactly, which we further speed up via a second-order cone programming approximation. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the potential benefits of the pricing mechanisms and algorithms.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00906 .</content>

    <title>The Unequal Diffusion of Honesty and Dishonesty in Workplace Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Honest and dishonest behaviors may both diffuse among the members of an organization. Knowing which of the two spreads faster is important because it impacts the extent to which managers will need to resort to other, potentially more costly solutions to curb dishonest behavior. Assessing empirically which of honest behavior or dishonest behavior spreads faster is challenging because this requires field measurements of social relationships and dishonest behavior of individual members, which poses both measurement and inference problems. We examine an original fine-grained data set from a large company that allows for identifying agents likely to be dishonest and interactions among employees while offering a natural experiment that circumvents the inference problems associated with identifying peer-to-peer diffusion. We find (1) that dishonest behavior diffuses, whereas honest behavior does not; (2) that diffusion likely operates through spreading information about opportunities for collusion; and (3) that policies that screen on dishonesty at hiring may be efficient to curb dishonest behavior in environments with high turnover.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Funding: R.

    <title>Navigating the Storm: Toward a Theory of IT Portfolio Diversity, Leadership Power, and Organizational Resilience to Major Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an era of escalating disruptions—from pandemics to economic crises—organizational resilience is vital for survival and growth. This study offers actionable insights for business leaders and policymakers on strategically leveraging information technology (IT) resources and leadership structures to navigate major shocks. We demonstrate that although diverse IT portfolios (e.g., cloud systems, data analytics tools) can enhance resilience by enabling adaptability, balance is key: moderate IT diversity strengthens resilience, but excessive diversity creates coordination complexities that erode it. Crucially, empowering IT leaders with formal decision-making authority helps firms maximize IT flexibility, shifting this tipping point to harness greater IT diversity without compromising coordination. Our analysis of firms during the pandemic reveals that crisis-induced industry turbulence further shapes these dynamics. Adverse turbulence intensifies the risks of overdiversification, requiring tighter alignment between IT strategies and leadership oversight. Conversely, beneficial turbulence allows firms to experiment with IT resources more freely. Policymakers can support businesses by fostering digital infrastructure, incentivizing IT leadership training, and creating frameworks for public-private data sharing during emergencies. By aligning IT flexibility with coordinated execution, firms can turn crises into opportunities for sustained success. This research equips stakeholders with evidence-based strategies to future-proof operations in an unpredictable world.</content>

This results in Clustered Analogy-Based Expectation Equilibria in which strategies are analogy-based expectation equilibria given the analogy partitions and analogy partitions minimize the prediction errors given the strategies. We distinguish between environments with self-repelling analogy partitions in which some mixing over partitions is required and environments with self-attractive partitions in which several analogy partitions can arise, thereby suggesting new channels of belief heterogeneity and equilibrium multiplicity.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unemployment differentials are greater between countries in the euro area than between U.S. states. In both regions, net migration responds to unemployment differentials, though the response is smaller in the euro area compared to the United States. We use a multi-country DSGE model with cross-border migration to quantify Mundell’s hypothesis that labor mobility could substitute for independent monetary policy in a currency union. While not as effective as independent monetary policy, increased labor mobility reduces business cycle fluctuations for most countries in the euro area. However, Mundell’s conjecture does not hold uniformly. For countries that primarily face demand shocks, labor mobility stabilizes inflation and unemployment and improves welfare. If supply shocks are dominant however, labor mobility increases the cost of being in a currency union by magnifying inflation volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a state-dependent “distributive decision rule” for simultaneous capacity allocation and job assignment decisions in a multiperiod stochastic resource allocation context with random supply replenishment, random demand, job waiting and abandonment. Our decision rule can be reformulated into a convex optimization problem with polynomial number of constraints and decision variables. Our framework can be applied in many service management settings such as ride-sharing fleet repositioning and patient management in healthcare. In simulations, our framework records 1%–15% improvements over alternative paradigms such as fluid approximations and approximate dynamic programming.</content>

    <title>Behavioral Externalities of Process Automation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the behavioral effects of process automation on human workers interacting with automated tasks. We introduce a stylized normative model with two workers who complete their tasks sequentially, working toward a joint project to obtain a fixed payment plus a variable bonus that depends on how early the project is completed. The normative model prescribes that, if workers are fully rational, they will complete their tasks as soon as possible if the early completion bonus is high enough. However, following the literature, we hypothesize that workers will suboptimally delay project completion. Following the insights from a behavioral model, we further predict that automation will alleviate this problem by reducing strategic uncertainty, resulting in an indirect behavioral benefit of a higher worker productivity, in addition to the direct benefit of a higher project completion rate and a shorter project duration. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment replicating the theoretical model, varying (i) whether a worker collaborates with a coworker or a robot, and (ii) in the case of collaborating with a robot, whether the upstream or downstream task is the one automated. First, we find that workers largely deviate from the optimal policy, as they take longer than what the normative theory prescribes to complete their tasks or do not complete the project. Second, we show that process automation increases the project completion rate and reduces the project completion time, confirming the benefits of process automation. Interestingly, workers who collaborate with robots take longer to complete their tasks, contradicting our initial hypothesis that process automation has a positive effect on the productivity of human workers. In addition, we find that upstream automation is more beneficial than downstream automation. We also show that social preferences are an important driver of these results because prosocial subjects tend to be more productive when collaborating with a human coworker than with a robot. Finally, we show that our findings remain robust in a continuous processing setting.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro for the Management Science Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, the City University of New York, and the University of Texas at Dallas.

    <title>Food Ordering and Delivery: How Platforms and Restaurants Should Split the Pie</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Food ordering and delivery platforms generate online demand for restaurants and deliver food to customers. In return, restaurants pay platforms a commission, typically a percentage of the order amount. Platforms offer partner restaurants the choice of a range of commission rates, rewarding higher commission payments with featured display slots and discounted delivery fees, both of which stimulate demand. Unfortunately, the current environment is grim: Platforms scurry to cover delivery costs, whereas restaurants gripe about excessive commissions. To understand current practice, we develop a game-theoretic model with a platform and multiple restaurants. Our modeling results highlight two existing problems. (1) Platforms, on their apps/websites, feature restaurants that are located too far away. Because these restaurants do not internalize the platform’s delivery costs, they are willing to choose aggressively high commissions to earn featured display. (2) Platforms charge delivery fees that are too high and set delivery boundaries that are too narrow. This is because they bear the entire burden of delivery but earn only a fraction of food revenues. To solve these problems, we propose a simple fix to existing commission contracts: beyond sharing food revenue (currently done but at high commission rates), platforms and restaurants can also split delivery costs and fees (currently not done). We show that our method attains first-best, that is, maximizes the total pie shared by platforms and restaurants. Using data on a representative city, we numerically show that, on average, our coordinating contract lowers commission rates by 33.3%, lowers delivery fees by 40.4%, increases restaurant profit by 25.0%, increases platform profit in 30.9% of the markets, and increases total profit by 13.3%. We discuss the characteristics of markets that enable our coordinating contract to yield a winning outcome for all parties.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00435 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It has been almost 20 years since socioemotional wealth (SEW) emerged as one of the main paradigms in family business research. From its inception this theory has been widely used to study a variety of phenomena unique to family firms yet there is limited understanding of what SEW is and how it works. Using the wisdom of accumulated research, we delve into the scholarly debate surrounding SEW as a dominant yet controversial paradigm within the family business field. We critically assess the existing knowledge on SEW with the aim of reexamining its core assumptions and existing limitations. Furthermore, we incorporate insights from 330 scholarly articles that have been published after SEW was first introduced in 2007 to explore its origins and implicit assumptions. We examine the often‐ambiguous results of SEW research and the oversimplified portrayal of family firms as ‘irrational’ or ‘risk‐averse’. We highlight critical, unclear areas in the SEW's body of work to help guide future SEW research in the coming decades.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using an experiment in which 3.1 million bank customers were encouraged to save, we explore the mechanisms behind coholding liquid savings and credit card debt. Theoretically, we show that the joint responses of spending, saving, and borrowing to the nudge differ across economic models of coholding. Using machine learning techniques, we find that the most responsive individuals reduce spending and increase savings by 4.9% (206 USD PPP per month) while their credit card debt remains unchanged. These individuals' marginal responses to the nudge are consistent with our model of coholding for the purpose of self‐ or partner‐control.</content>

    <title>Does corporate social responsibility increase access to finance? A commentary on Cheng et al. (2014)</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have long investigated the possible benefits of corporate social responsibility (CSR). One of the most influential of these studies tests and supports the hypothesis that CSR increases access to finance. Yet, I show here that the finding is unsound because the report's empirical method limits what can be inferred from its analysis. I rectify a key weakness and replicate the study. I observe a cross‐sectional association but find no evidence that CSR increases access to finance. My analysis suggests new directions for research on the effect of CSR.Managerial SummaryNumerous articles have explored the possible benefits of CSR. A highly influential study claims that CSR improves a corporation's ability to access capital, and this finding has been widely used by scholars, fund managers, and policymakers. Unfortunately, the finding is unsound because the study's research method used predicted values of access to capital rather than direct measures. A rectification and extension of the original analysis fails to uncover evidence that firm‐level changes in CSR are associated with access to capital.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;CEOs increasingly engage in activism on controversial social and political issues, such as police reform, LGBTQ+ rights, and gun control, to influence the behavior of policymakers. We run an experiment on 514 local elected politicians to examine how revealing information about CEO activism on police reform affects the views of policymakers. Additionally, we examine how CEOs’ controversial positions on social issues affect politicians’ willingness to privately meet with CEOs or publicly advocate for their businesses. We do not find that revealing CEO support for specific police reform policies affects policymakers’ opinions. Policymakers, however, are much less willing to engage—either privately or publicly—with CEOs who take controversial positions on social issues. These results do not vary with local economic conditions or the salience of police reform, but they appear to be driven by policymakers’ personal ideological commitments. Our results suggest that CEO activism may have limited influence on local politicians, at least on the topic of police reform, and they underscore the business costs of CEOs taking political positions. We discuss the implications for CEOs and the activist groups that often pressure them to take public positions on controversial issues.Funding: This work was funded by the UCLA Anderson School of Management and University of Virginia Darden School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18282 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Once information about leasing and corporate structure is incorporated into the way financial leverage is calculated, highly leveraged care homes are found to have a death rate twice as high as that of non-leveraged care homes before the government provided financial support (i.e., during the first wave). Highly leveraged care homes cut costs more aggressively and experienced the largest drop in cash reserves. Care homes controlled by private equity firms no longer display higher COVID-19 death rates once their significantly higher leverage is controlled for. Our results illustrate the importance of accurately measuring financial flexibility and the negative externalities caused by high leverage.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02923 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the importance of information technology (IT) in banking for entrepreneurship. Guided by a parsimonious model, we establish that job creation by young firms is stronger in U.S. counties more exposed to banks with greater IT adoption. We present evidence consistent with banks’ IT adoption spurring entrepreneurship through a collateral channel: entrepreneurship increases by more in IT-exposed counties when house prices rise. Further analysis suggests that IT improves banks’ ability to determine collateral values, in particular when collateral appraisal is more complex. IT also reduces the time and cost of disbursing collateralized loans.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02555 .</content>

    <title>Why Horizontal Organizations Don’t Fall Flat: Organizational Structure Shapes Perceptions of Egalitarianism and Company Warmth</title>
    <updated>2025-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, a growing number of companies have evolved toward relatively “flat” management structures with minimal hierarchical layers of management. Some even leverage this flatness as a key marketing message and defining element of corporate identity. Although organizational structure has been studied extensively throughout various disciplines, its influence on consumer response has received little attention. This research reveals that a company’s organizational structure can shape consumer perceptions of and subsequent responses to the company. All else being equal, perceived organizational flatness (vs. tallness) tends to induce more positive consumer reactions, such as increased purchase amounts, advertising engagement, purchase intentions, crowdfunding contributions, and brand choice. This phenomenon occurs because consumers infer that flatter companies foster relational egalitarianism, which, in turn, enhances perceived company warmth. However, the positive effect of perceived flatness is not universal. It is eliminated or reversed among people with a lower preference for egalitarianism, and those with conservative political ideologies. This work enriches our understanding of how a company’s organizational attributes, which are usually regarded as beyond the consumer’s purview, may shape consumer perceptions of the company, offering insights for businesses as they embrace new ways of communicating and promoting themselves to consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the dynamics of information demand and supply in capital markets, focusing on how firms’ disclosures align with analysts’ information needs. Using a novel dataset from Visible Alpha, we analyze granular data from analysts’ forecasting models to understand the breadth of information they seek and how firms meet these demands through mandatory and voluntary disclosures. We document significant variation in the complexity of analysts’ models and the extent of firms’ disclosures, leading to some items in analysts’ models remaining undisclosed. This unmet information demand gives rise to a novel concept we term “uncertainty about the past” (UP). We investigate its implications for key capital market outcomes, including analyst forecast dispersion, market reactions to earnings announcements, and stock market liquidity. Our results demonstrate thatUPplays a significant role in shaping the information environment, challenging the assumption that earnings announcements fully resolve uncertainty about past performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide an economics-based review of the pros and cons of ESG disclosures, emphasizing environmental disclosures from an investor-centric perspective. Our survey intends to guide corporate management and regulators in navigating the ESG disclosure terrain. Rather than summarizing the vast and growing ESG literature, we assess the economic arguments for ESG disclosure regulation and the form of this disclosure. We discuss investors’ demand for ESG information and its supply by publicly traded firms. We analyze the case for and against mandatory ESG disclosure. Finally, we weigh the efficiency of disclosure requirement characteristics, assuming mandatory ESG disclosure is warranted. We intend to be positive rather than prescriptive, providing a line of reasoning readers can employ to reach their own conclusions about what we ought to do.</content>

    <title>Is the Price Right? The Role of Economic Trade-Offs in Explaining Reactions to Price Surges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public authorities often introduce price controls following price surges, potentially causing inefficiencies and exacerbating shortages. A survey experiment with 7,612 Canadian and U.S. respondents shows that unregulated price surges raise moral objections and widespread disapproval. However, acceptance increases and demand for regulation declines when participants are prompted to consider economic trade-offs between controlled and unregulated prices, whereby incentives from higher prices lead to additional supply and enhance access to goods. Moreover, highlighting these trade-offs reduces polarization in moral judgments between supporters and opponents of unregulated pricing. Textual analysis of responses to open-ended questions provides further insights into our findings, and an incentivized donation task demonstrates consistency between stated preferences and real-stakes behavior. Although economic trade-offs do influence public support for price control policies, the evidence indicates that even when the potential gains in economic efficiency from unregulated prices are explicit, a significant divide persists between the utilitarian views that standard economic thinking implies and the nonutilitarian values held by the general population.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Johns Hopkins “Catalyst Award” and Business of Health Initiative (HBHI) and the Sandra Rotman Centre for Health Sector Strategy at the University of Toronto.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04555 .</content>

    <title>The Power of Disagreement: A Field Experiment to Investigate Human–Algorithm Collaboration in Loan Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human–algorithm collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in the economy and society. However, this collaboration is not always fruitful, and in extreme cases, people become human borgs or totally averse to algorithms. The key to collaborative value is whether humans and algorithms can complement each other in decision making, but it is challenging for humans to disagree with algorithmic recommendations at the right time (i.e., to disagree when algorithms are wrong and not disagree when algorithms are right). To understand the centric role of disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration and examine when and how it benefits, we conducted a field experiment in which human evaluators and algorithms worked together to evaluate loan applications under four scenarios, that is, limited/rich information and with/without disclosure of algorithm rationale. Our results show that human–algorithm collaboration decisions outperformed human- or algorithm-only decisions, and these collaborative values varied across the four scenarios. We further propose a theoretical framework for mechanism examination that centers on the formation and effectiveness of disagreement. We validate the framework empirically and come to the following findings: (1) disagreement exhibits a sizable and nonlinear influence on collaborative value, (2) the differences between human evaluators and algorithms in decision making contribute to disagreement but not to collaborative value, (3) algorithm self-contradiction triggers disagreement and helps human evaluators disagree with algorithms at the right time. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights on how collaborative value is achieved and managerial insights on how to manage disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration.This paper has been accepted by Hemant Bhargava for the Special Issue on The Human–Algorithm Connection.Funding: Y.

    <title>Rethinking How We Theorize &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; in Organization and Management: A Problematizing Review of Rationality and Anthropomorphism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has long held the promise of imitating, replacing, or even surpassing human intelligence. Now that the abilities of AI systems have started to approach this initial aspiration, organization and management scholars face a challenge in how to theorize this technology, which potentially changes the way we view technology: not as a tool, but as something that enters previously human‐only domains. To navigate this theorizing challenge, we adopt the problematizing review method by engaging in a selective and critical reading of the theoretical contributions regarding AI, in the most influential organization and management journals. We examine how the literature has grounded itself with AI as the root metaphor and what field assumptions about AI are shared – or contested – in the field. We uncover two core assumptions of rationality and anthropomorphism, around which fruitful debates are already emerging. We discuss these two assumptions and their organizational boundary conditions in the context of theorizing AI. Finally, we invite scholars to build distinctive organization and management theory scaffolding within the broader social science of AI.</content>

    <title>Do Gender-Role Violations in Initiating Structure and Consideration Help or Harm Employee Stress and Well-Being?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has noted the stress-reducing effects of leaders’ initiating structure and consideration, these behaviors are often gendered, with initiating structure as agentic, masculine behavior and consideration as communal, feminine behavior. Given these gender-role expectations, we examine whether there are different implications of women and men leaders’ initiating structure and consideration in relation to employee stress and well-being. Integrating expectancy violation theory and stress appraisal theory, we argue that perceived leader behaviors that violate gender roles (i.e., initiating structure by women leaders and consideration by men leaders) will be more powerful in reducing employee threat appraisals, which then reduces self-regulation depletion and in turn enriches employee well-being. Two studies—a time-separated field study and a set of experiments—support our proposals. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A substantial body of research highlights how stringent regulations disrupt innovators’ incentives and increase transaction costs, yet their information processing implication remains understudied. Building on information processing theory, we study how the interplay between formal and informal institutions shapes inventors’ information processing in developing artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. We examine the effect of stringent privacy regulations on AI innovation by exploiting the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) announcement. We argue that, following the GDPR announcement, GDPR-affected countries experience lower national AI innovation rates than unaffected countries. Further, we postulate that this negative effect is weaker in GDPR-affected countries, marked by higher levels of individualism, masculinity, and indulgence, but stronger in the affected countries with higher levels of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and long-term orientation. Our difference-in-differences analysis supports the proposed framework. Our research contributes to the international business literature by developing novel theoretical predictions at the intersection of comparative institutional analysis and national culture, explaining how privacy protection laws and cultural factors shape AI inventors’ information processing. Finally, this study provides insights into how inventors and entrepreneurs in countries with stringent privacy laws can leverage national culture to shape their AI innovation strategies and inform strategic decision-making.</content>

    <title>The Marketplace of Existential Authenticity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditionally, being authentic is regarded as something one is, where an entity is judged to possess the appropriate ‘authenticity’ attributes independently acquired outside of marketplace pressures. We consider two factors that challenge this traditional view to arrive at an alternative view of authenticity. First, we draw on existentialism that describes authenticity as a process of self-creation that occurs in interaction with others. Second, we consider neoliberal ideology whereby consumers are regarded as fully immersed market actors. By examining social media influencers (SMIs) who foster authenticity with overt marketization efforts, we identify a marketplace of existential authenticity where public performances of self-creation by an SMI are accompanied by resolute vulnerability that is valorized as work, thus warranting monetization. This cultural space of existentialism, where authenticity is something one does (vs. something one is), is governed by a ‘reflexive synopticon:’ a form of governmentality that shapes the actions of participants (SMIs, audience members, and the social media platform) through their mutual reflection on each other. Our work articulates how neoliberal horizontal governmentality structures operate, which includes the enabling (vs. antagonistic) role of the market. Moreover, our findings emphasize the culturally bound nature of different types of authenticities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice-oriented abstractThis study investigates how actively engaging potential backers through timely responses in campaign discussion boards influences fundraising success on reward-based crowdfunding platforms. Our findings reveal several critical implications. First, responses from campaign starters significantly attract new contributors. Second, starter response amplifies the “herding effect,” where the number of pledged backers attracts more new backers. Last, although achieving funding goals typically reduces momentum, we find that ongoing engagement via active response to backer comments mitigates this decline and sustains backer interest. Practically, fundraisers should actively manage discussions to signal trustworthiness, commitment, and manage expectations. Platforms can enhance communication effectiveness by summarizing key discussion sentiments, highlighting frequent topics, and integrating tools like live chat to foster efficient real-time communication. Adopting these practices can significantly enhance crowdfunding effectiveness and sustainability.</content>

    <title>Does Social Bot Help Socialize? Evidence from a Microblogging Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging advancements in large language models, social media platforms are increasingly deploying sophisticated chatbots, termed social bots, with the potential to stimulate user interaction. However, concerns linger regarding the socializing value of these bots in public settings. We investigate this phenomenon using data from the launch of CommentRobot on a microblogging platform. Analyzing user interactions with this platform-owned bot, we find that posts receiving bot-generated comments experience increased user engagement, demonstrating the socializing value of social bots at the post level. Results from an online experiment confirm this finding and reveal that the socializing value stems from both bot identity and high-quality content. Mechanism tests suggest that the quality of bot-generated comments—particularly their attractiveness, relevance, and inclusion of social cues—significantly influences user engagement. Moreover, we evaluate existing bot targeting strategies and propose policy learning-based improvements to optimize engagement. Despite the positive impact on post-level engagement, we find that receiving bot comments primarily encourages future bot-related posts rather than increasing overall user posting activity, contrary to platform expectations. Our findings highlight the need for platforms to refine social bot deployment strategies to maximize user engagement while mitigating unintended consequences.</content>

    <title>Emotionality in Political Social Media Communications: The Moderating Role of Audience Diversity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Politicians are increasingly turning to social media to engage with the public. At a time marked by extreme partisanship, rhetoric is often emotionally charged. But does this help or hinder efforts to engage followers and attract new ones? Our research examines how the emotionality of U.S. senators’ tweets affects both engagement (e.g., shares) and follower growth. Although emotional posts can increase engagement, this effect diminishes for senators from ideologically diverse battleground states, especially when the emotion is negative. For diverse constituencies, less emotional content may actually lead to greater engagement. Although emotionality can fuel engagement, it is the substantive content of posts that drives follower growth. These findings have implications for political discourse and communication strategy. Although intensely emotional and negative posts may energize a homogeneous base, they can alienate broader audiences and do not attract new followers. Beyond politics, content creators must be mindful of audience heterogeneity and be judicious in the use of emotionally charged messaging.</content>

However, how ecosystems emerge and evolve remains unexplored. In a question‐based examination of the solar photovoltaic ecosystem, we observe that ecosystems emerge earlier than predicted through the “transfer” of ecosystem elements, in a process of “re‐specialization,” and ecosystem roles from adjacent ecosystems. Second, the larger ecosystem has a unique life cycle, expanding while the focal industry contracts. Third, variance in institutional regime logic and orientation shapes where and how ecosystems evolve. Finally, bottlenecks shape ecosystem evolution, leading to an expansion in the bottleneck element through both new entry and migration from other ecosystem areas.Managerial AbstractInnovation ecosystems, or the larger group of firms producing components and complements, play a pivotal role in the ability of firms to create value with an innovation.

    <title>Yes, We (Still) Can! A Qualitative Study on the Dynamic Process of Team Resilience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on psychological resilience in the workplace is on the rise, aiming to better understand how to successfully manage adverse events. Although scholars have started to explore the concept of team resilience, the focus of the theory on team resilience has been largely on cognitive mechanisms. However, neglecting the role of relational mechanisms discounts the collaboration and social interaction that are necessary for successful teamwork, especially in the face of adverse events. To address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study with a palliative care team that experienced work-related adverse events. Based on our data and applying conservation of resources theory, we develop a process model of team resilience. This model specifies the experience of adverse events as loss events and illustrates how teams can counteract these losses and enact team resilience through the relational process of caring. Caring in teams can be enacted through four dimensions, which we refer to as understanding, being with, doing for, and enabling. By enacting these caring dimensions, teams can heal social safety and collective action capabilities and can moreover build valuable resources, which may buffer resource loss and fuel resource growth in subsequent team resilience episodes. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of relational processes in team resilience enactment and specify caring as a core relational mechanism that enables team resilient outcomes. Overall, we provide a nuanced understanding of the different elements within a team resilience process.</content>

    <title>Shades of Grey or Black and White? How Entrepreneurs’ Use of Cognitively Complex Language Affects Investor Funding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how entrepreneurs’ use of cognitively complex language—language that involves nuance, differentiation, and comparison—influences funding decisions of early-stage investors. Our theorizing builds on the notion that individuals interpret language as a social signal and attribute another person’s language use to that person’s general dispositions. On this basis, we surmise that investors perceive an entrepreneur as more cognitively complex—that is, engaging in more nuanced and differentiated thinking—the more the entrepreneur uses cognitively complex language. Arguing that perceived cognitive complexity matches investors’ prototypical construals of entrepreneurial competence, we hypothesize a positive relationship between an entrepreneur’s use of cognitively complex language and the investment amount they receive. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we also argue that signaling cognitive complexity has a decreasing marginal effect, and that elite education functions as a credibility signal, amplifying the association between cognitively complex language and investment amount. A field study of 547 actual investment pitches and a randomized experiment with 240 professionals support our ideas. Our study introduces a more nuanced portrayal of complexity in entrepreneurial communication, accentuates the role of entrepreneurs’ signals of cognitive dispositions, and introduces the concept of cognitive complexity, and linguistic displays thereof, to entrepreneurship theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that a lesser known yet economically significant tax-deferral feature of ETFs’ security design is crucial to their success. By relying on the in-kind redemption exemption, authorized participants help ETFs avoid distributing capital gains and reduce their tax overhang, partly by deploying heartbeat trades. We estimate that the ETF tax efficiency has increased long-term investors’ after-tax returns by 1.05% per year relative to mutual funds in recent years. Exploiting cross-sectional and time-series variations in investors’ tax burden, we show that tax efficiency is a significant driver of capital migration by high-net-worth investors from mutual funds into ETFs.

    <title>Bargaining Foundations for the Outside Option Principle</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Dilip Abreu, Mihai Manea</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a bargaining game in which a seller can trade with one of two buyers, who have values h and l (h &amp;gt; l). The outside option principle (OOP) predicts that the seller trades with the high-value buyer with probability converging to 1 at a price converging to max (h/2,l) as players become patient. While this prediction is supported by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), a wide range of trading outcomes may emerge in subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs): in the patient limit, the seller can obtain any price in the interval [h/2,h] (and no other); moreover, allocative inefficiency and costly delay are possible. We propose equilibrium refinements less restrictive than Markov behavior that guarantee trading outcomes consistent with the OOP. One refinement requires that a buyer's relative probability of trade does not increase dramatically following a failed negotiation with that buyer. Another refinement posits that the seller does not approach a buyer hoping that negotiations fail. SPEs satisfying both refinements conform with the OOP (but need not be MPEs). Our benchmark model features strategic matching by the seller. We provide a parallel analysis for the random matching protocol. Under random matching, prices in SPEs may also rise above and fall below l, but have a narrower range. A refinement particular to this protocol that restores the OOP requires that a random mismatch should not impact the seller excessively.</content>

    <title>Legislators’ demand for firms’ financial statements: evidence from U.S. congressional redistricting events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether U.S. House representatives and their staff seek financial information from constituent firms to inform their legislative decisions. We exploit shifts in U.S. congressional districts (i.e., the reconfiguration of federal district lines or redistricting) that introduce new constituent firms to legislators’ districts. To the extent that legislators and their staff collect and rely on firms’ financial statement information, we expect that a change in representation as a result of redistricting will result in a significant and observable change in searches for information about new constituent firms. Our evidence supports this prediction. We also find that the timing of searching coincides with legislators’ roll call votes, particularly ahead of more controversial bills and for bills lobbied by sample firms. Finally, we find that new constituent firms respond to increased information demands after a redistricting event by supplying more policy-relevant disclosures and increasing lobbying.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint Shelf Design and Space Planning Problem with Placement Options</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sandra Zajac, Heinrich Kuhn</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces the first joint shelf design and space planning problem that considers two placement options for items – hanging and shelving – on flexible shelves. These types of shelves are used in sectors such as do-it-yourself and toy retail, and for household goods in grocery stores. However, they have received limited attention in the literature, which typically focuses on regular shelves with a single placement option: placing items on shelf panels. The problem requires three interdependent decisions: (1) the placement option for each item (shelving or hanging), (2) the shelf design (number and vertical positioning of shelf panels), and (3) the shelf space planning (assignment of facings as well as the vertical and horizontal positioning of items). We formalize this problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop a greedy multi-start matheuristic to efficiently solve practical instances. Computational experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms both a commercial solver and a benchmark method for two-dimensional shelf space planning in terms of runtime and solution quality.A comprehensive analysis of synthetic instances and a real-world case study provides several managerial insights. First, hanging items enables more flexible use of shelf space, which is especially beneficial when item variety is high. However, when large vertical grabbing gaps must be considered, stacking items on shelf panels may be more advantageous. In turn, there is a risk of wasted space due to height or width mismatches. Second, the number and size of the segments on the shelf significantly influence layout profitability, highlighting the need to jointly optimize shelf design and space allocation. Third, it is common practice to arrange hanging items in horizontal rows, which can be facilitated by segmenting the shelf space. While this improves visual appeal, increasing the number of segments tends to reduce overall space utilization and profitability. Finally, a real-world case study involving 237 products across six categories from a European grocery retailer confirms the practical applicability of our approach. It demonstrates significant potential for improving space utilization and layout efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, the authors examine the impact of star creator exits on digital content markets, leveraging exogenous events on Twitch.tv. Using a Synthetic DiD approach, they estimate the causal effects of star creators’ exits from the live streaming platform. Their findings reveal that, at the live streaming category level, the exit of a star creator leads to a sizable decrease in both content provision and consumption within the star creator’s focal category. At the individual creator level, the effects are heterogeneous, varying by the creator’s audience size and contractual status with the platform. Major creators reduce their content provision, while micro creators maintain their streaming activity, though both groups experience a decline in viewership. Additionally, contracted creators tend to sustain their content provision levels following a star creator’s exit, whereas non-contracted creators exhibit a significant decline. Lastly, the authors find that the impact of a star creator’s departure persists for several months, indicating a lasting effect at both the category and individual levels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do host country stakeholders evaluate foreign MNEs’ local impact? Although MNEs’ desire for a reputation for positive societal impact is well-established in the literature, much less is known about how to actually obtain one—especially in less developed frontier markets. In this inductive, qualitative study across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we examine why host country stakeholders deem some foreign MNEs to have a better reputation for societal impact than others and how firms’ actions and attributes influence these stakeholder perceptions. Leveraging signaling theory, we identify three distinct types of signals (compatible, crossed, and conflicting) and three critical factors (benefit diffusion, empowerment, and hybrid solutions) that shape MNEs’ reputation for societal impact. We also shed light on the role of contextual factors at the country, industry, and community levels. In addition to these theoretical contributions, our study also yields practical implications for MNEs of including local stakeholders’ perspectives when crafting market and nonmarket strategies, fostering constructive communication between headquarters and subsidiaries as well as between expatriate and local actors, and finding ways of going beyond ‘fitting in’ to instead ‘stand out’ in order to gain a reputation for providing tangible and intangible forms of societal impact in frontier markets.</content>

Payment for order flow (PFOF) wholesalers compete via price improvement in exchange auctions. To attract retail orders, wholesalers run more auctions when their recent price improvement has been lower. However, auction price improvement lowers market maker revenues. Wholesalers earn revenues to pay PFOF in nonauction trades where their designated market maker status increases their execution priority. While some auctions produce substantial price improvement, most do not have multiple bidders offering meaningful price improvement. Overall, options market structure better promotes competition in auctions than in nonauctions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyse the behaviour of multinational enterprises (MNEs) within a host nation – Australia – during deglobalization (1914–79). Deglobalization is often portrayed as a drastic event to which MNEs respond swiftly, probably through withdrawal from host countries. However, we generate new FDI and firm population data to reveal incumbent MNEs remained. We then deploy historical primary evidence from three companies to analyse their responses. Firms adapted by deepening their local engagement, drawing on local information sources and entrepreneurship, and by shifting some strategic control to the subsidiary. These adaptations extended across decades, as each MNE wrestled with knowledge gaps and organizational rigidities that reflected its particular administrative heritage. Our historical methodology also reveals how firms were affected differently, responded at different speeds, and varied in their subsequent embeddedness. We conclude that deglobalization's impact on firms may be a subtle, reiterative, and prolonged process, rather than a sudden and dramatic event.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can displays of charity capacity cues paradoxically harm charities' fundraising efforts? Six pre‐registered studies provide evidence of acharity capacity cursewhereby donors penalize charities for displaying capacity cues, such as human resources capacity, organizational capacity, and financial capacity cues. This curse occurs because donors perceive higher‐capacity charities as needing less help. As donors typically donate based on need, they donate less to charities with superior capacity signals. This effect is attenuated when: (1) higher‐capacity charities' needs are made salient, and (2) donors reflect on how their decision impacts end‐beneficiaries. This research contributes to the literature on effective altruism and charity perceptions while offering managerial insights for charities seeking to optimize their fundraising communications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a new source for the declining role of small banks in the banking industry: Long-term changes in the banking sector are partially a consequence of changes in the industrial sector. Small banks are relatively more exposed to small business shocks, because small businesses compose a larger share of their customers. Lower real-side demand for small business financial services is responsible for part of the relative decline in small banks’ deposits. Rough calculations suggest that deposits at small banks would have been $280 billion higher from 2002 to 2017 if small firms had grown at the rate of larger firms. (JEL G21, G34, L25, R12)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of tax benefits of debt on firms remains an open question. The 2017 U.S. tax reform limited the tax advantage of debt for all firms except for small businesses with average sales below $25 million. A regression discontinuity design based on the exception threshold shows that, as tax benefits of debt shrink, corporate debt declines significantly, while equity does not increase sufficiently to offset the reduction. Treated firms also decrease their investments due to the higher cost of capital. Overall, we document a first-order role for tax incentives that affect the cost of capital in shaping corporate policies. (JEL G31, G32, G38, H25, K34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the causal effects of precommitment framing, motivational deadlines, and semi-personalized information on military servicemembers’ retirement savings using a randomized field experiment. Low-cost emails highlighting a motivational deadline or semi-personalized salary information increased participation by about 1 percentage point (control mean is 1.25 percent) and contribution rates by about 0.05 percentage points (control mean is 3.92 percent) among previous non-participants. These programs demonstrate a cost-effective and scalable tool by which managers can increase employees’ retirement savings.</content>

    <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fairness concerns arise naturally across a wide range of decision-making contexts and application domains. Addressing these concerns requires integrating fairness measures into optimization models; however, quantifying fairness, as well as formulating and solving fairness-promoting optimization problems, remain significant challenges. In “A Unified Framework for Analyzing and Optimizing a Class of Convex Fairness Measures,” M. Y. Tsang and K. S. Shehadeh propose a new framework that unifies different fairness measures into a general, parameterized class of convex fairness measures. They introduce a unified framework for optimization problems with a convex fairness measure objective or constraint, including unified reformulations and solution methods. Additionally, they establish mechanisms for quantifying the impact of employing different convex fairness measures on the optimal solutions to the resulting fairness-promoting optimization problem. Numerical experiments, including applications to resource allocation and facility location, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the unified framework over traditional ones.</content>

    <title>Performance Pay, Internal Control, and Employee Misconduct</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine a scenario in which an employee exerts productive effort to achieve a target but can also manipulate a performance measure to falsely claim target achievement. Although manipulation is detrimental from a societal perspective because of its negative externalities, the firm’s shareholders may benefit from undetected manipulation. We analyze the firm’s optimal implementation of internal control and its impact on the employee’s productive effort and manipulative behavior. We demonstrate that a profit-maximizing firm primarily utilizes internal control to enhance the employee’s performance pay contract; however, this does not necessarily reduce manipulation. We identify situations in which internal control reduces or aggravates manipulation and discuss factors that can complement internal control to combat manipulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), Project ID 403041268–TRR 266, Accounting for Transparency and under Germany’s Excellence Strategy, EXC 2126/1–390838866.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04232 .</content>

    <title>Painful Prices: The Moral Harm Model of Price Fairness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ responses to seller’s prices, including perceptions of price fairness and unfairness, are a crucial aspect of the marketplace. While past literature has uncovered a variety of factors that influence perceptions of price fairness (PPF), the lack of an overarching conceptual framework has constrained understanding of when and why consumers are more likely to perceive prices as fair or unfair. The authors develop a conceptual model of PPF as moral judgments and propose that these moral PPF arise from consumer inferences of potential harm from a price. The conceptualization suggests that inferred harm—and thereby, PPF—are influenced by consumer vulnerability, product welfare impact and firm price strategy (e.g., costs and prices, differential pricing and price promotions). The authors also propose that consumer political orientation and inferred firm self-defense motives moderate the relationship between inferred harm and PPF and that inferred firm motives for prices influence PPF. Eight studies test this conceptualization. The results support the moral harm model and provide novel insights, showing when unchanged prices, price increases and price decreases are likely to be perceived as more unfair, and when differential prices (including paying more than others) are likely to be perceived as fairer than equal prices.</content>

    <title>Voluntary Technology Sharing to Rivals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a firm’s incentive to share its proprietary technology to help a rival develop a new product. Whereas the rival’s product introduction increases competitive pressure on the firm, it also turns the rival into a multiproduct firm, raising cannibalization concerns that affect its pricing strategy. We find that the rival’s internal cannibalization may soften competition in the existing product market, creating a positive externality for the focal firm and, thus, motivating voluntary technology sharing. We characterize the conditions under which the firm benefits from sharing: generally, the firm is incentivized to share if the new product’s valuation is neither too high nor too low. A high valuation of the new product deters sharing because of excessive competition, whereas a low valuation fails to trigger cannibalization, eliminating the firm’s incentive to share. Our analysis further shows that new product introduction generally enhances social welfare except when the existing product has high valuation and the new product has relatively low valuation. Consumer surplus increases only when the existing product’s valuation is low. These findings offer guidance for policymakers, suggesting when favorable policies should be implemented to promote technology sharing in cases in which social welfare or consumer surplus is not maximized.</content>
