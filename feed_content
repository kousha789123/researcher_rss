    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <title>Learning When Reading: Evidence from an Online Mobile Reading Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <title>The Determinants of ESG Ratings: Rater Ownership Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how common ownership affects Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—an important research question given the increasing use of these ratings in investment decisions and corporate evaluations. We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Cryptocurrencies*</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores U.S. public firms’ cryptocurrency holdings and accounting practices from 2013 to 2022 against the backdrop of the recently enacted crypto accounting rule, ASU 2023‐08. Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manipulated consumer reviews are a growing concern for digital platforms, undermining trust and distorting market outcomes. This study analyzes data from the Apple App Store to assess how both positive and negative manipulated reviews—later filtered by the platform—affect app sales rankings. Surprisingly, both one-star and five-star manipulated reviews initially boost app rankings, even when one-star reviews are intended to harm competitors. These effects can persist for weeks and take up to six months to reverse through platform filtering. Using text analysis, we find that negative manipulated reviews are linguistically more distinguishable from organic ones than are positive manipulated reviews, making them easier for consumers to spot. Our results show that review volume often outweighs valence in influencing consumer behavior, and that manipulated reviews have stronger effects on free apps, gaming apps, and apps from large developers. These findings underscore the urgency for platform managers to invest in faster, more accurate filtering systems, and highlight the need for policymakers to strengthen governance mechanisms to protect marketplace integrity and consumer trust.</content>

    <title>Transferring, Eliminating, or Both? The Strategic Impact of Resale Platforms and Consumer Learning on Coping with Consumer Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For sellers of experience goods, consumer uncertainty threatens profits. Resale platforms and enhanced consumer learning are popular tools to manage this uncertainty, but their impacts differ significantly and require tailored strategies. Our research reveals critical nuances overlooked by prior studies: the resale platform’s negative effect is often underestimated because of its indirect influence on consumer waiting behavior, whereas consumer learning can harm sellers of high-cost goods when consumers are impatient. Critically, the profitability and environmental outcomes depend on production costs and consumer patience. Encouraging consumer learning creates a profit-environment win–win with patient consumers, whereas resale platforms excel with impatient consumers and high costs. Combining both mechanisms benefits sellers only when consumers are patient and costs are moderate ([Formula: see text]"). Key strategic imperatives emerge: (i) resale behavior: encourage selectively (beneficial mainly for high-cost goods), minimizing resale discounts; (ii) learning behavior: nurture consumer patience and avoid rushing purchases, especially for premium goods; and (iii) product upgrades: avoid frequent, minor updates. Sellers must move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches, aligning their uncertainty management (resale, learning, upgrades) with product economics and consumer patience to optimize profits and sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper shows that competing firms with competitive advantages in distinct attributes can credibly coordinate their messaging about attribute importance, reducing consumer uncertainty and generating category demand. A truthful equilibrium arises in which each firm highlights the more important attribute—even when at a disadvantage—but such an equilibrium does not exist without competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHospital-affiliated online health communities (OHCs) offer a powerful tool to enhance off-line care quality and promote health equity. This study reveals that, when physicians participate in OHCs, their patients experience a 3.87% reduction in mortality risk and a 4.63% increase in recovery rates. A key mechanism is the improvement in care continuity—better care coordination and stronger patient–provider relationships—facilitated by online interactions. Crucially, these benefits are significantly more pronounced for patients with low socioeconomic status, demonstrating OHCs’ potential to reduce healthcare disparities. To maximize impact, healthcare providers should actively encourage physician engagement in OHCs, integrate these platforms with existing health records, and promote their use among disadvantaged populations. Policymakers can leverage OHCs as a strategic tool to advance equitable, high-quality care.</content>

    <title>CEO Human Capital and Digital Product Innovation: A Dynamic Managerial Capabilities Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHow does the human capital of chief executive officers (CEOs) drive digital product innovation in manufacturing firms? Analyzing data from 216 U.S. firms and over 8,000 new product announcements, this study shows that technological and business knowledge can both enable and inhibit digital product innovation, depending on the external environment. In stable settings, tech-savvy CEOs drive digital product innovation, whereas business-savvy CEOs focus elsewhere. In dynamic environments, these effects reverse. These findings offer a contextual view on the ongoing debate about the value of technological versus business expertise in top management, suggesting that neither type of knowledge is universally beneficial. We also find that CEOs serve as distinct innovation catalysts beyond their top management teams. Follow-up interviews reveal the diverse strategies they use to initiate, develop, and implement digital product innovation in established firms. Based on these findings, the study offers guidance for boards of directors on aligning CEO selection with environmental demands and for CEOs seeking to expand their knowledge base to more effectively foster digital product innovation under varying conditions.</content>

    <title>Quality Control for Crowd Workers and for Language Models: A Framework for Free-Text Response Evaluation with No Ground Truth</title>
    <updated>2025-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As businesses increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as customer service and information retrieval, ensuring the accuracy of their responses is a critical challenge. Traditional verification is costly, slow, and often requires scarce domain experts. We introduce the automated quality evaluation based on textual responses (AQER) framework, a novel, cost-effective method to assess the correctness of free-text answers from both LLMs and human workers without needing preexisting correct answers. AQER works by intelligently aggregating multiple responses to the same question, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to create a reliable synthetic correct answer, followed by an iterative procedure that accounts for response quality cues. AQER obtains state-of-the-art performance compared with existing automated response evaluation baselines. For managers AQER offers a scalable, data-driven method to (i) evaluate and select the best performing LLMs for specific organizational needs and use cases, (ii) continuously monitor artificial intelligence (AI) performance to ensure reliability and accountability across different model versions, and (iii) manage the quality of crowd workers essential for high-quality AI training and validation. AQER, thus, offers a robust mechanism for improving model performance and mitigating the significant financial and reputational risks associated with deploying untrustworthy generative AI technologies.</content>

    <title>Examining the Impact of Generative AI on Users’ Voluntary Knowledge Contribution: Evidence from A Natural Experiment on Stack Overflow</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice and policy abstractGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping online knowledge-sharing, but its effects on voluntary user contributions remain uncertain. This study examines how the usage of ChatGPT influences users’ answering behavior on Stack Overflow, one of the world’s largest question-and-answer platforms. Using a natural experiment, we find that access to generative AI increases the number of answers users provide, whereas those answers are typically shorter and easier to read. These patterns suggest that users are learning from AI outputs, enabling them to share knowledge more efficiently. However, intensive reliance on AI introduces cognitive strain, which can reduce contribution levels. For practice, our findings underscore the importance for platform owners and managers to strike a balance between AI integration and user support. Encouraging AI-assisted learning can expand participation and improve the accessibility of content, but safeguards are necessary to prevent cognitive overload and ensure the quality of answers. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of establishing clear guidelines for the responsible use of AI in community-driven platforms. By designing thoughtful integration strategies, organizations can harness the benefits of AI—enhancing efficiency and readability—while sustaining authentic, high-quality knowledge contributions.</content>

    <title>Content Moderation with Shadowbanning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms face increasing pressure to moderate harmful content while preserving user engagement and free expression. We examine shadowbanning—a strategy that hides content without notifying the user—and compare it to traditional content removal. Our results show that if users only moderately believe that shadowbanning occurs, the platform benefits from a larger user base and higher profit, which also leads to greater social welfare than with content removal or no moderation. Shadowbanning allows the platform to reduce users’ exposure to extreme content without deterring content creators, enabling more participation of users across the extremeness spectrum. However, outcomes depend on user beliefs and the accuracy of moderation technology. When users are highly suspicious of shadowbanning or when moderation tools are significantly imperfect, the platform’s incentives—and the societal benefits—decline. These findings offer practical insights for platform designers and regulators: shadowbanning can be effective, but its benefits hinge on how transparently and accurately it is implemented. Policymakers should account for user perceptions and technological capabilities when evaluating or regulating opaque moderation strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations become more diverse, women are increasingly entering traditionally male-dominated technical fields like HVAC repair. However, in these gendered workplaces, women face structural biases that limit their access to the informal knowledge sharing networks crucial for task performance while also encountering significant barriers to promotion and career advancement. This study examines how access to codified organizational knowledge through online repositories can help women circumvent these workplace disadvantages, enabling them to enhance their performance and improve their prospects for professional success. Accessing general knowledge from a knowledge repository on a just-in-time basis helps improve female technician’s performance. These female technicians’ comprehensive information processing approach is the underlying mechanism of why women can better utilize general knowledge in general documents to aid independent problem solving in the field. Also, although women in this male-gendered domain face barrier to promotion, accessing more firm-specific knowledge from problem-solution documents increases their likelihood of being promoted within the firm, helping them mitigate some of the extant bias against women. General knowledge on the other hand helps women find external opportunities for career advancement.</content>
