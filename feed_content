    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how autonomous Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams prioritize competing financial and social goals during 9‐1‐1 calls. Prior research highlights organization‐level solutions that enable single‐goal pursuit, but it remains unclear how frontline professionals manage competing goals that are interdependent and inseparable during task execution. We argue EMS teams will dynamically prioritize goals across calls depending on contextual factors. Using quasi‐random assignment of 9‐1‐1 patients to EMS crews in 31 US states, we find that crews prioritize the financial goal on private insurance calls but shift toward the social goal when agency financial need is low or call acuity is high. Surprisingly, these patterns are most pronounced in non‐profit EMS agencies. Our study offers new insight into how professionals manage goal trade‐offs in real time.Managerial SummaryWhat happens when professionals must pursue competing goals—like financial performance and equitable service—but organizations cannot separate them across tasks? Using data from 31 US states, we examine how Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams navigate this tension during 9‐1‐1 calls. We find that crews dynamically prioritize goals based on perceived risk and opportunity—even without managerial intervention or immediate incentives. Teams provide more services to privately insured patients to increase revenue but shift toward equitable care when patient needs are more urgent or agency finances are stable. Surprisingly, these trade‐offs are most pronounced in non‐profit agencies. Our findings suggest that when goals collide within tasks, managers can shape frontline decision‐making by influencing how professionals understand goal risk and opportunity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock returns exhibit reversals at short horizons but slowly transition to momentum over longer horizons. To help understand this pattern, we develop a multiperiod model with short- and long-horizon noise traders, and active investors who underreact to information they do not themselves produce. The model accords with the transition from reversals to momentum and yields the following novel predictions: (a) attenuated reversals after earnings announcements, (b) a negative relation between monthly reversal and longer-term momentum profits across economies and time, and (c) larger reversals when there is more noise trading. Empirical analysis using U.S. and international data supports these predictions. (JEL G12, G14, G41)</content>

    <title>The Confirmation Nudge: Prompts to Change or Confirm Initial Preferences Steer Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Across two field experiments and several pre-registered laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that confirmation nudges, which ask consumers whether they would like to confirm or change their initial choice, impact choice. First, consumers navigating a subscription company’s smartphone app were randomized to a control or confirmation nudge condition, which asked them to either confirm their initial choice or switch to an annual subscription. Confirmation nudges increased subscribers’ choice of the annual subscription by over 8 percentage points–an effect size similar to default effects tested by the same company. In Experiment 2, conducted by a jewelry retailer, confirmation nudges had countervailing effects, increasing purchases of a nudged service plan add-on, but decreasing originally-planned jewelry purchases likely because it added a step and thus frictions to the purchase process. Confirmation nudges had larger effects when nudged options were desirable and among consumers who would benefit from the nudge (Experiments 3-4). But, they were perceived as more manipulative than comparison conditions (Experiment 5). We suggest that confirmation nudges undo tendencies to focus on initially-preferred options, shifting attention towards alternatives relative to control conditions. Consistent with this, confirmation nudges were especially effective when the wording of the confirmation prompt focused on the “switch” option.</content>

    <title>Is There Fairness in AI?</title>
    <updated>2025-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly steer workplace decisions, debates around fairness have intensified. Existing research often approaches fairness either as a set of universal principles supported or undermined by algorithms, or as a product of social interpretations, thereby providing either technologically deterministic or purely social accounts. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a human resources (HR) department of a large international company that introduced AI in hiring, this study offers an alternative view that shifts focus to how fairness emerges through the ways people define, embed, and perform values with algorithms. Taking a sociomaterial perspective, we find that the introduction and use of AI resulted in crowding out expert practices of performing fairness, favouring instead the version performed by HR. Our process model explains this outcome by the growing symbiosis between HR's professional mandate for fairness and AI procedures, where each legitimizes, shapes, and protects the other over time. This study thus shows that fairness is not pre‐given but constantly redefined and enacted through evolving associations between professional mandates and AI technologies.</content>

    <title>Not All Political Ties Are the Same: Firms’ Ties to the Government and Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complementing research on the implications of political ties for firms’ strategic decisions and financial performance, recent studies are increasingly focusing on the environmental consequences of firms’ political connections. We contribute to this stream of work by integrating insights from the literature on political ties and the multifaceted nature of governments to explore how the level of government influences the pollution implications of firms’ political ties. Specifically, we theorize and demonstrate that, in China, firms’ achieved political ties with high levels of the government reduce pollution, while such ties with low levels of the government increase it. Furthermore, we examine how these relationships are moderated by firm owners’ social class and the attention by different levels of the government to their respective primary goals. Our analysis of data from 6,758 privately-owned Chinese enterprises provides support for our predictions. Our main conceptual contribution is to add more nuance to the research on political ties by highlighting the contingent role of the level of government in shaping firms’ pollution outcomes.</content>

    <title>High flying adored: How CEO narcissism influences firms' responses to above‐aspiration performance with risky organizational change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on performance feedback presents conflicting views on how above‐aspiration performance influences organizational change. Some studies argue that it constrains change due to a lack of organizational motivation, while others suggest that it enables change by expanding managerial discretion. Reconciling these perspectives, we suggest that managers’ narcissistic tendencies can fundamentally alter how a firm responds to above‐aspiration performance. We theorize and find evidence that high‐narcissism CEOs respond to above‐aspiration performance with more acquisitions—attention‐generating actions that align with their self‐enhancement motives, while under similar conditions low‐narcissism CEOs avoid acquisitions, due to their uncertainty and risk. Our findings highlight the interplay between managerial discretion and personal motivations in shaping strategic responses to performance feedback, offering new insights into the role of executive personality in corporate decision‐making.Managerial SummaryDo successful firms pursue bold strategic moves—or play it safe when firm performance is strong? Our study seeks to answer this question and reconcile conflicting findings about how above‐aspiration performance influences managers’ decisions to undertake risky organizational change, such as corporate acquisitions. We show that it depends on CEO narcissism. High‐narcissism CEOs—who seek attention, hold an inflated self‐view, and are more egoistic—are motivated to initiate bold, high‐risk changes like acquisitions. In contrast, low‐narcissism CEOs—who avoid challenging tasks, hold a modest self‐view, and are sensitive to negative evaluation—are motivated to avoid bold, high‐risk changes like acquisitions. By showing how CEO narcissism affects firms’ risky change actions, we offer new insights into the role of executive personality in corporate decision‐making.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Breaking Barriers: Improving Patient Adherence to Appointments and Provider Productivity through Telehealth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Telehealth services became popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet their operational impacts on healthcare organizations are not well-understood. Patient behaviors can vary significantly between telehealth and in-person appointments, introducing new challenges and opportunities for healthcare delivery. We examine two key behaviors contributing to non-adherence to medical appointments: no-shows and unpunctuality. Analyzing 412,415 telehealth and inperson appointments across a major US medical system from 2020 to 2022, we find that telehealth appointments reduce no-shows by 3.0 percentage points (23.1%) and late-arrivals by 11.4 percentage points (35.6%), indicating significant improvements in appointment adherence. We also find that telehealth is particularly effective in improving adherence to follow-up appointments but may be less suitable for initial consultations with new patients. In addition, telehealth improves adherence most among demographic groups with historically lower in-person attendance – women, racial minorities, Medicaid patients, and younger adults – underscoring its potential to reduce disparities in access. Our analysis suggests that while telehealth may increase patient revisit rates and create extra work for providers, the gains from reduced no-shows, particularly for follow-ups, lead to a net boost in provider productivity. Finally, we explore the best strategies to integrate telehealth into a provider’s daily scheduling template, showing that scheduling telehealth appointments before in-person visits enhances operational efficiency compared to the opposite sequence. Policymakers should recognize telehealth’s capacity to improve appointment adherence, reduce disparities, and enhance productivity, and support its adoption through appropriate regulations. Healthcare organizations should strategically deploy telehealth to address the root causes of patient non-adherence. By offering telehealth appointments to patients facing barriers to in-person care, they can simultaneously optimize both access and productivity.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Global Sourcing for Supply Resilience in the Presence of Emergency Contract Renegotiation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In light of the recent frequency of global emergencies that result in overseas delivery delays and cost surges, many multinational brands consider reshaping their sourcing configurations by incorporating local suppliers that may be of lower quality than globally selected counterparts. In this global context, pre-committed emergency renegotiation clauses have gained recognition as a common practice in international commercial contracts, which enable contractual parties to adjust key terms, such as the wholesale price and order quantity, during ex-post emergencies. This work aims to investigate how the presence of overseas emergency renegotiation affects the brand’s strategy preference for dual versus single sourcing and the decision-making of supply chain parties. By comparing with two widely observed benchmark scenarios—contract termination and contract continuation at post-recovery cost—that exclude overseas emergency renegotiation, we show that in the presence of emergency renegotiation, the overseas supplier under both sourcing strategies may lower its wholesale price for the brand in response to a higher delay probability, which would not be the case in the contract termination benchmark. This price-cutting effect encourages the brand to order more from the overseas supplier, even if the delay probability is high. Furthermore, the brand favors dual sourcing if the overseas post-recovery unit cost is either low or high, driven by a distinct incentive under renegotiation: the local supplier may suppress the local rival by setting a high wholesale price, a scenario not possible in the contract continuation benchmark. Our study highlights the value of emergency contract renegotiation in reshaping resilient sourcing strategies for multinational brands facing global emergencies, even with ex-post local reorder or overseas quality deterioration during recovery.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The placement of facilities in service regions with continuously distributed demand poses a difficult problem, often requiring discretization methods that can potentially introduce approximation errors. This study presents a robust approach to address this challenge of continuous spatial distribution by considering the problem of facility placement under the spatial uncertainty associated with future demand locations, without resorting to discretization and its associated errors. We propose a spatial-data-driven optimization approach to deal with the key challenges, namely the continuous region of potential demands, sparse historical demands, and non-stationarity of the spatial distribution of demands. To this end, we model the spatial uncertainty using a Wasserstein distance based spatial ambiguity set, wherein we leverage popular clustering algorithms to form subregions to explicitly capture the spatial structure of demand occurrences. This proposed spatial ambiguity set does not require the discretization and demand aggregation approach commonly employed in the literature, while still maintaining the optimization tractability. Following a distributionally robust optimization framework with the proposed spatial ambiguity set, the problem is reformulated as a mixed integer semi-infinite optimization problem, which is then solved by our row-and-column generation algorithm. To study the practical performance, we conduct a numerical study in the emergency response context with the real data of fatal road traffic accidents in the city of Leeds, UK. Numerical results suggest that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks and attains facility locations that can potentially provide shorter response times to future demand occurrences. In particular, our proposed approach attains an out-of-sample performance improvement of 7–9% over the sample average approximation approach and an improvement of 5–8% over the discretization and demand aggregation approach under higher future spatial uncertainty.</content>

    <title>Many-Server Queueing Systems with Heterogeneous Strategic Servers in Heavy Traffic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic Servers with Individual Preferences in Heavy TrafficAgents in service systems are known to strategically adjust their service speeds to maximize idle time. “Many-Server Queueing Systems with Heterogeneous Strategic Servers in Heavy Traffic” by Büke, dos Reis, and Platonov is the first work to rigorously examine strategic heterogeneous servers in queueing systems. The authors address this technically challenging problem using a novel asymptotic framework that provides valuable insights into equilibrium behavior. The analysis goes beyond existing literature by incorporating a remarkably general class of utility functions and routing policies, allowing for variation in agents’ marginal utility of idleness. One of the key results shows that the celebrated square-root staffing rule retains its optimality—even in the presence of strategic behavior—when agents are sufficiently averse to low levels of idleness.</content>

    <title>Corporate Pension Risk Transfers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sponsors of corporate defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the United States transferred $155 billion pension obligations to insurance companies between 2012 and 2022. These pension risk transfers (PRTs) reduced the pool of corporate DB plan participants by 12% and are a huge business for the involved insurers. We assemble a new PRT database and highlight three features of PRTs: (i) the burden associated with mandatory Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insurance premiums drives PRT activity; (ii) using an upper bound measure for the impact of PRTs, we estimate that the average sponsor reduces its pension obligations and plan participants by 22% and 27%, respectively. These large reductions are mainly because of the transfer of retired plan participants to insurance companies. (iii) Plan sponsors that conduct PRTs have less default risk and less volatile pension assets even after conducting the PRTs. Hence, PRTs increase the risk of the remaining PBGC pool.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S.

    <title>My Advisor, Her AI, and Me: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Human–AI Collaboration and Investment Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid ongoing policy and managerial debates on keeping humans in the loop of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making processes, we investigate whether human involvement in AI-based service production benefits downstream consumers. Partnering with a large savings bank in Europe, we produced pure AI and human–AI collaborative investment advice, which we passed to the bank customers and investigated the degree of their advice taking in a field experiment. On the production side, contrary to concerns that humans might inefficiently override AI output, our findings show that having a human banker in the loop of AI-based financial advisory by giving her the final say over the advice provided does not compromise the quality of the advice. More importantly, on the consumption side, we find that the bank customers are more likely to align their final investment decisions with advice from the human–AI collaboration, compared with pure AI, especially when facing more risky investments. In our setting, this increased reliance on human–AI collaborative advice leads to higher material welfare for consumers. Additional analyses from the field experiment along with an online controlled experiment indicate that the persuasive efficacy of human–AI collaborative advice cannot be attributed to consumers’ belief in increased advice quality resulting from complementarities between human and AI capabilities. Instead, the consumption-side benefits of human involvement in the AI-based service largely stem from human involvement serving as a peripheral cue that enhances the affective appeal of the advice. Our findings indicate that regulations and guidelines should adopt a consumer-centric approach by fostering environments where human capabilities and AI systems can synergize effectively to benefit consumers while safeguarding consumer welfare. These nuanced insights are crucial for managers who face decisions about offering pure AI versus human–AI collaborative services and also for regulators advocating for having humans in the loop.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Designing Layouts for Sequential Experiences: Application to Cultural Institutions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A fundamental issue faced by experience providers—ranging from retail to culture—is displaying a collection of items for physical and digital interactions. The arrangement of the exhibits in different locations, which we call the layout, affects the visitors’ choices over time and space, thereby driving their engagement with the offered experience. In a collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum (Netherlands), we develop a predict-then-optimize framework to inform such operational decisions. First, we propose a sequential choice model, called pathway multinomial logit, that represents visitor activity as a sequence of conditional logit outcomes influenced by the layout. Estimation on large-scale visitor activity logs recorded on multimedia guides reveals that increase in spatial distances and search distances on the multimedia guide interface are strongly correlated with a reduction of transition propensity between artworks, while also uncovering relationships with artwork characteristics and contextual features. Counterintuitively, in response to more congestion, visitors may interact with more exhibits, including less prominent artworks. Our model predicts the next visitor transition with an out-of-sample accuracy of 63%. We test the predictive accuracy of our model against several benchmarks and modified layouts. Finally, we formulate the layout optimization problem, where the goal is to assign artworks to different locations to maximize the expected length of visitors’ paths. We establish a strong inapproximability result for this new optimization setting. Our simulations suggest that optimized layouts might lift visitor engagement by improving proximity and retention exerted by the layout.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent surge in the popularity of short-form video (SFV) on digital platforms has led to massive numbers of videos and ever-evolving topics. As a result, the task of making personalized recommendations has become increasingly challenging. We introduce a new pure exploration problem on SFV platforms: finding a ([Formula: see text])-optimal set that includes all recommendations within the [Formula: see text]-optimality gap and that excludes those beyond the [Formula: see text]-optimality gap relative to the best arm with a capacity limit of K. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm called adaptive acquisition tree (AAT). AAT jointly accounts for user preference heterogeneity and high-dimensional product characteristics. It adaptively segments users and then, learns a personalized transductive policy that can be used on partially observed or even unobserved card types to accommodate the dynamic trends on SFV platforms. We derive the sample complexity required to identify a [Formula: see text]-optimal set. Our method’s efficiency is validated through numerical tests using data from the NetEase platform. Our results reveal that the proposed policy performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art benchmarks across four transductive scenarios for both spotlight recommendations (i.e., best-arm identifications) and [Formula: see text]-optimal set recommendations. Compared with the best benchmarks for the best card and [Formula: see text]-optimal set recommendations, our approach can elevate the average rewards (measured by view time) by 30% (to 100%) and 43% (to 56%), respectively. Given the increasing popularity and uniqueness of SFVs and more broadly, user-generated content, our method offers significant academic and practical merit.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For some types of goods, rarity itself is valued: items considered “fashionable” are demanded in part because they are unique. In this paper, we explore the economics of rare goods using auctions of limited-edition shoes held by an e-commerce platform. We model endogenous entry and bidding in multiunit auctions and construct demand curves from realized bids. We find that doubling inventory reduces willingness to pay by 8%–15%. From the monopolist’s perspective, ignoring the value of rarity leads to substantial overproduction: Auctioned quantities are 88% above the profit-maximizing level. From the consumers’ perspective, however, the negative spillovers from quantity restriction more than offset the benefits of rarer goods.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04995 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women remain underrepresented not only as startup founders but also as nonfounding employees (“joiners”). Yet there is limited understanding of how to address this disparity. Whereas traditional explanations have emphasized individual employment preferences, we shift the focus to employers’ decision making. We propose that weaker employment protection—which reduces termination costs—increases women’s likelihood relative to men of being hired by startups rather than incumbent firms, as it enhances employers’ flexibility to experiment with traditionally overlooked candidates. We further hypothesize that this effect is less pronounced when information cues counteract stereotypical beliefs about women hires, such as when (a) women have experience as founders, or (b) the focal startup operates in an industry with a higher representation of female employees or female startup employees. Using Portuguese registry data on new hires from 2009 to 2013 and a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) design, we provide empirical support for these predictions. Our study highlights gender disparities in hiring between startups and incumbent firms and shows that weaker employment protection can help reduce this gender gap.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: R.

    <title>Capital Structure Effects Associated with the New Lease Accounting Standard</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study finds that the requirement of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 for firms to capitalize operating leases in financial statements beginning in 2019 resulted in firms affected by the standard reducing the reliance on existing debt (debt not associated with the capitalization of operating leases) by 7%–10% on average relative to unaffected firms. We find that firms with greater operating lease capitalization as a result of implementation of ASC 842 have the largest reductions in the reliance on existing debt. In addition, the relative decrease in existing debt associated with adoption of the standard is concentrated among firms whose debt contracts are less likely to be based on a fixed set of accounting standards, those with a higher likelihood of violating loan covenants, and those whose capital structures are more affected by the standard relative to other firms in their industry. Taken together, these findings suggest that contracting costs play a significant role in firms’ relative decrease in existing debt following implementation of ASC 842. Much of the related literature on ASC 842 documents efforts to reduce the impact of the lease standard prior to adoption. In contrast, our findings suggest that firms were unable to offset completely the increased leverage effects from the adoption of the standard, resulting in affected firms additionally reducing their reliance on existing debt.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04447 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Bots Bargaining with Humans: Building AI Super-Bargainers with Algorithmic Anthropomorphization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As AI-powered negotiations spread, their psychological and relational impact remains unclear. We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that trains a bot to aim for superior economic outcomes while appearing “human” (“algorithmic anthropomorphization”). In a bargaining game experiment, we compare this “superhuman” bot to two simpler alternatives: a bot that mimics human behavior and a purely efficient bot. Our results show that (a) superficial anthropomorphization can make a bot seem human but does not improve subjective evaluations, (b) the efficient bot is so rational it is easily exploited, undercutting its performance, and (c) the superhuman bot achieves superior economic results while appearing more human than actual humans. Yet even when bots act indistinguishably from humans, they may trigger an “uncanny valley” effect, lowering subjective evaluations regardless of performance. Because subjective evaluations predict future negotiation outcomes, these findings highlight the potential negative impact AI bargaining algorithms can have on long-term customer relationships. We urge firms to measure more than objective outcomes when assessing AI negotiators.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multiple Unit Offers and Rate Calculations: How Rates Influence Price and Promotion Sensitivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers are often faced with multiple unit offers (e.g., $40 for 5 lbs of coffee) in the marketplace and must figure out how to evaluate them. While the total price (e.g., $40) is always provided, the associated rate information is not (e.g., $8/lb for coffee). The focus of this research is on understanding the role that these rates play in influencing consumer decision-making. The authors find that regardless of whether rates are provided by managers or calculated by consumers, consumers are more sensitive to promotional offers with dollar per unit (vs. unit per dollar) rates because dollar per unit rates increase price salience. Additionally, when rate information is not provided, the authors document how these rates are computed by consumers. The authors find that consumers prefer to use the larger numerosity element as their rate’s numerator, which leads to calculating units per dollar rates when the multiple unit offer’s quantity is larger in numerosity than the price but dollars per unit rates when price is larger in numerosity than the quantity. The authors discuss theoretical, practical, and policy implications.</content>

    <title>The More, the Merrier? Membership Expansion and Incumbents' Boundary Work Divergence in the Platformization of Belgian Philanthropy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When actors emerge on the periphery of a field, incumbents either engage in protective boundary work to enforce the field's membership criteria, or opt for membership expansion by adapting these criteria to accommodate peripheral actors. Less explored is the divergence configuration where a minority of incumbents pursue expansion whereas the majority adopt a protective strategy. Since the inclusion of peripheral actors may challenge membership criteria (i.e., the symbolic boundary) and shift the resource distribution and social hierarchy (i.e., the social boundary), how minority incumbents induce membership expansion against the majority's protective stance is an intriguing question. Drawing on a qualitative field‐level case study of Belgian philanthropy, we examine incumbent foundations' responses to the rise of ‘social‐mission platforms.’ We identify four mechanisms through which minority incumbents can overcome the majority's initial opposition and bring about support to membership expansion: affirming divergent expansive posture, leveraging definitional ambiguity, demonstrating comparative reinforcement, and facilitating shared buy‐in. We further show how each mechanism bridges the social and symbolic boundaries through the combined (re)actions of the diverging incumbents and the peripheral actors. Our findings extend understandings of membership expansion as a contested, multi‐actor process and unpack the interaction of social and symbolic boundaries in shaping field evolution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Farmer, Schmidt, and Timmermann (FST) document time‐variation in market return predictability, identifying “pockets” of significant predictability through kernel regressions. However, our analysis reveals a critical discrepancy between the method outlined by FST and the code actually implemented. Instead of using a one‐sided kernel, which guarantees out‐of‐sample forecasts, they perform in‐sample estimation with a two‐sided kernel. As a result, future information leaks into the forecasting model, undermining its reliability. Rectifying this error qualitatively alters the findings, invalidating most conclusions of the FST study. Thus, attempts to exploit such “pockets”—should they exist—offer little help in forecasting market returns.</content>

    <title>Fairness Perceptions in Demographic Targeting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deciding which customer segment(s) to serve, or targeting, is a cornerstone of marketing strategy. While companies commonly target based on demographic characteristics, recent cultural movements (e.g., #MeToo, Black Lives Matter) have heightened sensitivity to the differential treatment of certain demographic groups. Yet research to date has not examined whether demographic targeting itself seems fair or appropriate. Fourteen experiments (N = 9,399), 13 supplemental studies (N = 7,065), and two Facebook A/B Tests (N = 513,151) reveal that when consumers learn or infer that they or others have been targeted based on demographic characteristics, fairness perceptions and brand support suffer (relative to broad advertising). To explain why, we propose a conceptual model based on the extent to which consumers view demographic targeting as discriminatory (ie, differential treatment based on attributes that are irrelevant and/or uncontrollable), and whether the discrimination is perceived as intentional (ie, knowingly or willingly bringing about an avoidable outcome). Consequently, factors that (a) improve relevance (ie, whether belonging to the targeted segment is diagnostic of preferences) or (b) increase controllability (ie, whether consumers themselves determine their membership in the targeted segment) attenuate perceptions of unfairness, as do variables that (c) reduce perceived intentionality (e.g., firm size, industry norms).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper empirically studies the effects of the early law-and-economics movement on the U.S. judiciary. We focus on the Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges, an intensive economics course that trained almost half of federal judges between 1976 and 1999. Using the universe of published opinions in U.S. Circuit Courts and 1 million District Court criminal sentencing decisions, we estimate the within-judge effect of Manne program attendance. Selection into attendance was limited, as the program was popular among judges of all backgrounds, frequently oversubscribed, and admitted participants on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that after attending economics training, participating judges use more economics language in their opinions, rule against regulatory agencies more often, and impose more severe criminal sentences. We argue that economics, as a rigorous social science, was especially effective in persuading judges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should a large investor trade when their actions influence—and are influenced by—others in the market? This paper investigates optimal execution in financial markets where order flow is endogenous and governed by self-exciting dynamics. Market order arrivals are modeled using a Hawkes process, with intensity shaped by the trader’s own activity—capturing a feedback loop between execution and market response. The study considers both risk-neutral and risk-averse investors under market impact, deriving closed-form and semi–closed-form optimal strategies. In the risk-averse case, the solution skews execution toward earlier periods to mitigate inventory risk. The model is also extended to more general Hawkes kernels, enhancing practical applicability. The findings shed light on how sophisticated traders can minimize execution costs while accounting for the risk of being tracked in increasingly transparent markets. This work offers actionable insights for algorithmic execution under realistic microstructure dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We investigate why some firms succeed in using AI for innovation, whereas others fail, focusing on the organizational support necessary for leveraging AI in both novel and incremental innovation. Specifically, we examine how the lean startup method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping—focused on developing minimum viable products—and controlled experimentation—focused on rigorous testing such as A/B testing. We find that LSM complements discovery-oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using A/B testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high-quality products in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct because different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Consequences of Resorting to Fines and Investments to Regulate Data Portability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many jurisdictions have implemented data portability regulation (DPR) that requires that Data Controllers (DCs) enable users to download their personal data so that they can port their data to competing DCs. The intention of DPR is to return partial control of data to users, improve user choice of DCs, increase DC participation in the market, and reduce industry concentration. To achieve this, if nonmonetary corrective measures (e.g., warnings, orders to comply) to obtain portability compliance fail, then DPR allows policy-makers to impose fixed or variable (based on revenue) fines on DCs that do not comply. Additionally, policy-makers may invest to decrease compliance costs for DCs. We model this interaction as a two-stage game where in the first stage the policy-maker sets fines and makes investments. In the second stage DCs decide whether to participate in the market, and if so whether to comply with DPR. Contrary to the current regulatory objectives, we find that with partial compliance both fines and investments decrease DC participation and increase industry concentration. Comparing the use of fines and investment to achieve a predetermined level of compliance, the use of fixed fines has a smaller (larger) collateral effect on concentration (participation) than either variable fines or investment. Once all DCs that participate comply—full compliance—then additional investment increases participation. Moreover, full compliance and full participation can occur only if there is a DPR-induced demand expansion, such as from multihoming, and investment is the only instrument that can attain this outcome.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN/06571-2015]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2022-0460].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08404 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a search and bargaining model of over‐the‐counter markets for nonstandardized assets of heterogeneous quality. Once matched, investors privately learn their values positively correlated with asset quality. Bargaining results in delay that is hump‐shaped in quality and U‐shaped in asset turnover. We document these patterns in commercial real estate and corporate bonds markets. Extreme qualities are little affected by changes in asset standardization, while intermediate qualities are more susceptible. For nonstandardized assets, opacity ensures active trading of all assets, which explains why their trading is decentralized and suggests that trade centralization should come with greater standardization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although everyone must make decisions about where to live, we know little about how consumers perceive social interactions with neighbors and incorporate information about neighbors into their residence decisions. This article explores the impact of consumers' self‐construal on the importance they attribute to neighbor information when choosing a residence. Across seven preregistered studies, including lab experiments and online surveys, the findings consistently show that independent consumers, compared with interdependent ones, place greater importance on information about potential neighbors. This tendency stems from independent consumers' stronger desire for social closeness with neighbors, prompting them to place more weight on information that will help them find neighbors with whom they could become friends.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital streamers gain popularity in live commerce, online retailers face critical questions about the actual business value of their operations. This study offers timely, evidence-based insights into the economic impact and optimal design of digital streamers. Although current designs do not significantly improve sales over no live streaming, incorporating behavioral realism—especially enhanced real-time question and answer (Q&amp;A)—can boost sales by 25%, making digital streamers as effective as human hosts. Visual upgrades and human-like voices also help but to a lesser degree. Importantly, not all AI-driven enhancements deliver immediate returns, and imitating human scripts does not guarantee success. Retailers should focus on dynamic human-AI interaction features that drive engagement and trust, such as real-time Q&amp;A and interactive giveaways. Designers are encouraged to integrate multiple realism features to maximize effectiveness while managing cost and scalability. These findings offer actionable guidance for retailers and platform designers seeking to leverage AI effectively and cost efficiently in live streaming commerce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What human capital do established organizations need to bring new ideas to market? Combining Danish registry and Community Innovation Survey data, we document a robust positive relationship between hiring former founders and firms' sales from innovation. Entrepreneurs join smaller, younger firms (which exhibit larger effects), managerial skills and external industry founding experience matter, while other selection or human capital‐based explanations appear muted. Founder hires especially enhance innovation when given middle management decision rights, for incremental offerings, and in innovation‐active firms. Our collective findings indicate startup experience equips founders with a generalist ability to acquire and mobilize resources around new ideas. By clarifying the nature of entrepreneurial human capital, we highlight a novel innovation input that helps firms unlock its commercial value.Managerial SummaryAs entrepreneurial careers proliferate, former founders represent a growing pool of potential employees with expertise in bringing new products and services to market. Can hiring entrepreneurs help established organizations enhance innovation? Using data from Denmark, we answer this question affirmatively and offer several explanations. Former founders gravitate towards younger, smaller established firms, where effects are stronger; they also bring valuable managerial skills and external industry founding experience. Notably, they generate more value when given broader authority as middle managers, for less obvious resource combinations, firms already active in innovation or research and development, and higher uncertainty contexts. Taken together, our findings suggest former founders' distinct combination of skills helps firms marshal resources around new offerings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;After medical marijuana legalization (MML) by U.S. states, firms’ cost of equity (COE) decreases, especially for those with more growth opportunities, higher productivity, or a more skilled workforce. This policy change also reduces firm risk and leads to an increase in labor supply through increased labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and net migration. Further, home prices rise after MML, reflecting increased local housing demand due to a growing supply of workers. These findings align with theoretical models that link asset prices to labor markets and suggest that MML can lower firms’ COE by mitigating labor search frictions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the effects of a multiday cyberattack that forced offline a technology service provider (TSP) to the banking sector. The attack impaired customers’ ability to send payments through the TSP, but the business continuity plans of banks and the TSP reduced the effect by more than half. Large banks performed better. Through contagion, banks not directly exposed to the attack experienced a liquidity shortfall, causing them to borrow funds or tap reserves. The ability to send payments after hours helped avoid further contagion. These results highlight the importance of preparedness by the private and official sector for cyberattacks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aggregate U.S. bank lending to firms expanded following the outbreak of COVID‐19. Using loan‐level supervisory data, we show that this expansion was driven by draws on credit lines by large firms. Banks that experienced larger credit line drawdowns restricted term lending more, crowding out credit to smaller firms, which reacted by reducing investment. A structural model calibrated to match our empirical results shows that while credit lines increase total bank credit in bad times, they redistribute credit from firms with high propensities to invest to firms with low propensities to invest, exacerbating the decrease in aggregate investment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do movements in the distributions of bank size and income affect the macroeconomy? To answer this question, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous financial intermediaries, incomplete markets, and aggregate uncertainty. We find that market incompleteness and uninsured idiosyncratic bank rate of return risk generate minimal concentration in the bank net worth distribution, leading to an “as-if” result, whereby the economy behaves as if it had a representative bank. However, introducing ex ante heterogeneity in the banks’ rates of return significantly raises concentration and amplifies real and financial fluctuations relative to the representative-bank case, as this increases a key sufficient statistic, the average marginal propensity to lend. We then extend the model with two empirically validated features of the banking sector—countercyclical return risk and deposit market power—and show that these amplify and dampen aggregate fluctuations, respectively. Finally, because in the model with ex ante heterogeneity the distribution of bank size is highly concentrated, shocks to the largest banks can account for almost all of the aggregate variation that is due to idiosyncratic risk, leading to granular banking and economic cycles. The failure of granular banks (“too big to fail”) produces sizeable macroeconomic crises.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Data-Driven Bunker Refueling Under Price Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bunker refueling decisions in international shipping are crucial operational choices. Each ship acts like a movable storage unit navigating through diverse markets, procuring bunker fuels from different ports to sustain its voyage. This involves grappling with challenges posed by varying bunker fuel prices over time and locations. To address this, we propose data-drivenstructure-prescriptive (SP) approachesthat combine the strengths of modern machine learning with the insights from traditional OR modeling and optimization. Instead of predicting future fuel prices, our approach directly learns the optimal policy from data and adapts refueling decisions to the current market conditions, including fuel prices, crude oil price, NYSE index, etc.Our focus lies in leveraging the well-established understanding that the optimal refueling decision adheres to a state-dependent base-stock refueling policy. This decision depends on factors such as the port of call, fuel tank capacity, market conditions, and is finite-valued, depending on the ship’s schedule and voyage. We provide a practical framework to incorporate these structural properties into data-driven decision-making. The finite-valued property, for instance, establishes a connection between the refueling problem and multi-class classification, integrating OR modeling with machine learning.We test our approach through experiments under both simulated scenarios and a real-world example involving the Asia-North America Trade Route. The proposed SP approaches successfully recovered the “true” optimal refueling policy in synthetic simulations. Our real-world data experiments further demon-strate that integrating structural properties into the learning process enhances the quality of prescriptions, particularly when training data is limited. Specifically, with one and a half years of training data, the proposed methods outperform current industry practices. With less than three years of training data, our models yield substantial fuel cost savings, approximately 40 US dollars per metric ton, during the testing period.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Efficiency and Interventions of Strategic Driver Relocation for Ride-Hailing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Idle drivers’ spontaneous relocation, when provided with sufficient information, has the potential to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance in ride-hailing services. As this potential remains ambiguous, this study aims to address two fundamental questions and derive managerial insights: Q1: To what extent can drivers’ spontaneous relocation resolve the supply-demand imbalance? Q2: How can subsidies be designed to induce the platform optimum? We propose a leader-follower game-theoretic framework to investigate the dynamic relocation game on arbitrary service networks. The platform, as the leader, designs relocation subsidies to achieve service-oriented or interest-oriented goals, while idle drivers, as followers, decide relocation and compete for individual returns in a multi-stage context. Despite the inherent problem complexity, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, transformation, and solution of the driver equilibrium, providing insights into these critical questions. First, the platform should avoid issuing subsidies purely for relocation purposes when drivers’ actions align with platform goals, such as 1) when the supply and demand are sufficiently imbalanced in volume, eliminating drivers’ gambling behavior, and 2) when commission rates are low—a plausible case in practice—due to the tension between the platform and drivers. Second, we present the potential of the platform intervention in other cases, providing theoretical references for the platform expectations. Notably, due to the extra responsibility gap, the subsidy impact on completed trips exceeds that on platform profits, with the latter at most doubling. Third, we investigate the imbalance in demand that values the platform’s intervention. While a certain spatial imbalance or a demand surge in peak hours emphasizes subsidies for platform goals, the spatial and temporal imbalance can possibly complement each other, inducing coupled demand that directly achieves platform-optimal goals. These results comprehensively answer Q1 along with practical suggestions. Fourth, for Q2, we confirm its feasibility and provide actionable subsidy configurations that induce platform-optimal goals to aid platform management. Numerical examples demonstrate that sparse network structures can lead to larger realized gaps. Additionally, drivers with appropriately random behavior can enhance platform performance, suggesting careful information disclosure by platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores the effects of competition on fair trade operations. Specifically, as a benchmark, we first consider a model with a single fair trade organization (FTO), i.e., a monopoly FTO. We then extend the analysis to a setting with two competing FTOs, i.e., duopoly FTOs. Although both FTOs share the common goal of alleviating farmers’ poverty, they adopt contrasting strategies: one FTO seeks to lower the barriers to fair trade, aiming tomainstreamit, while the other maintains stricter standards to preventfairwashing(orgreenwashing). Following industry practices, we implement two modes of competition and compare them with the monopoly benchmark. We find that, while competition between FTOs increases the aggregate demand for fair trade certified products (mainstreaming), it results in less aggregate premium (fairwashing). Furthermore, we consider the potential application of blockchain technology in fair trade operations and demonstrate that it offers a promising solution to mitigate thefairwashingeffects from competition between FTOs.</content>

    <title>Does Q&amp;amp;A Boost Engagement? Health Messaging Experiments in the United States and Ghana</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective information sharing is critical for the success of organizations and governments. Because information that is easy to access is more likely to be adopted, leaders often minimize friction in information delivery. However, one type of friction may increase engagement: piquing curiosity by posing relevant questions prior to sharing information. To test this, we shared identical information about COVID-19 in either question-and-answer format or via direct statements across two preregistered field experiments in Ghana and Michigan (total n = 49,395). Q&amp;A-style communication increased information seeking about directly related topics (e.g., how to wear a mask properly) by 1.0 percentage point (216%) in Ghana and by 1.1 percentage points (19%) in Michigan (p’s &lt; 0.001) and increased self-reported behavior change by 1.3 percentage points (4%) in Michigan (p = 0.002). However, sharing information in Q&amp;A format did not increase interest in general COVID-19 information in either setting, suggesting that the impact of Q&amp;A-style messaging on information seeking may be issue specific. In Michigan, both Q&amp;A-style and direct statement messaging produced less information seeking than sending no informational messages, likely because of differential attrition: the more texts participants received, the more likely they were to opt out of receiving messages, which made it impossible for them to seek more information via text. In a follow-up implementation experiment with social media ads (a messaging strategy without attrition challenges), Q&amp;A-style ads generated 9%–11% more unique clicks to the CDC website per dollar spent than ads that directly stated information about vaccines (p &lt; 0.001). We speculate that Q&amp;A-style information delivery may stimulate curiosity, driving its benefits.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the National Science Foundation [RAPID Grant 2033321], the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Northwestern University’s Global Poverty Research Lab, Stanford University’s Golub Capital Social Impact Lab, Harvard Business School, the University of Pennsylvania, the AKO Foundation, John Alexander, Mark J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We utilize the introduction of mobile payment technology by the largest bank in Singapore in 2017 to study how mobile payment technology reshapes economic activities and stimulates business creation. After the introduction, business-to-consumer industries witnessed 18.3% more business creation relative to business-to-business industries, with the effect driven by small firms and more pronounced among industries with higher cash handling costs. Underlying this pattern is consumers’ strong adoption of mobile payment and a reduction in ATM cash withdrawals during the post-shock period. The reduced transaction cost also increases consumers’ spending capacity, which justifies the business growth. Interestingly, part of the increased consumer demand is credit card spending. The pattern of changes is consistent with the bank’s adjustment to the technological change: it reduces ATMs and allows more credit card openings and higher credit limits.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: Y.

    <title>Conquering the Divide? The Role of Political Polarization in the Destigmatization of a U.S. Medical Marijuana Platform Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A documented recent rise in the polarization of American legislative politics underscores the question of how increasing political polarization affects organizations and industries. Yet, organizational scholars have not directed significant attention to the impact of polarization. In this paper, we demonstrate that political polarization may play an important role in organizational dynamics by revealing that polarization may expedite the destigmatization of legal yet historically stigmatized industries. To this end, we develop a theory explaining how political polarization normalizes counter-normative behavior and encourages customers to become open about their engagement with stigmatized products and organizations—a key step toward industry destigmatization. We further argue that this polarization impact may vary across regional markets because of differences in local legitimation processes that can either amplify (normative legitimacy) or attenuate (regulatory legitimacy) the effect of polarization on consumer engagement with a stigmatized industry. We find empirical evidence for our theorizing in analyses of all U.S. dispensaries of medical marijuana that existed on the online platformWeedmaps.comfrom its beginning in 2008 to 2014. Ultimately, this paper suggests that political polarization can significantly influence organizations and industries and thus warrants more systematic investigation and attention from organizational scholars, particularly in stigmatized industries.</content>

    <title>Connected to a Sinking Ship? Firm Performance in a Besieged Autocracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Doing business in an autocracy that still permits the existence of markets is fundamentally different than operating under a democracy. This variety of state capitalism, termed authoritarian capitalism, requires specific form of political connections to the regime in order to survive and, in some cases, to thrive. However, authoritarian governance has another defining feature—namely paroxysms of political violence of different modalities, a phenomenon that can harm business but may benefit those who are connected to the regime. This paper examines life under a particular authoritarian capitalist state, 19th-century tsarist Russia, via an examination of one politically connected firm, the full-service steamship firm Kavkaz i Merkurii (Caucasus and Mercury). Using never-before-utilized company archival material to examine the firm’s relationship with the tsar, I find that management directly pursued intense business linkages with the government, even appointing tsarist officials and members of the royal family to leadership positions. This behavior increased even as political violence skyrocketed throughout Russia. A formal empirical analysis shows that this strategy was mostly beneficial for the firm, as some forms of political violence were received positively by shareholders as a source of new business. However, military action that drew heavily on the firm—where the government was underpaying relative to market rates—was perceived negatively by investors, and violence, which could have threatened the regime, manifested in higher long-term volatility. This paper shows both the benefits and costs associated with political connections under authoritarian capitalism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formulate a tractable model of pricing under directed search with heterogeneous firm demands. Demand characteristics drive bids in a position auction and enable us to bridge insights from the ordered search literature to those in the position auction literature. Equilibrium pricing implies that the marginal consumer’s surplus decreases down the search order, so consumers optimally follow the firms’ position ordering. A firm suffers from “business stealing” by firms that precede it and “search appeal” from subsequent firms. We find rankings that achieve the maximal joint profit or consumer surplus by constructing firm-specific scores. A generalized second price auction for positions endogenizes equilibrium orders and bids are driven by position externalities that impact incremental profit from switching positions. The joint profit maximization order is upheld when firm heterogeneity concerns mostly their mark-up potentials. But the consumer welfare order is robust when firms differ mostly over their potential market sizes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Politicians rely on political brokers to buy votes throughout much of the developing world. We investigate how social networks facilitate these vote-buying exchanges. Our conceptual framework suggests brokers should be particularly well-placed within the network to learn about non-copartisans’ reciprocity in order to target transfers effectively. As a result, parties should recruit brokers who are central among non-copartisans. We combine village network data from brokers and citizens with broker reports of vote buying, allowing us to use broker and citizen fixed effects. We show that networks diffuse information about citizens to brokers who leverage it to target transfers. In particular, among those citizens who are not registered to their party, brokers target reciprocal citizens about whom they can learn more through their network, and these citizens are more likely to support the brokers’ party. Moreover, recruited brokers are significantly more central than other citizens among non-copartisans, but not among copartisans. These results highlight the importance of information diffusion through social networks for vote buying, broker recruitment, and ultimately for political outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A seller with commitment power sets prices over time. Risk-averse buyers arrive to the market and decide when to purchase. We show that it is optimal for the seller to choose a constant high price punctuated by occasional episodes of sequential discounts that occur at random times. This optimal price path has the property that the price a buyer ends up paying is independent of his arrival and purchase times, and only depends on his valuation. Our theory accommodates empirical findings on the timing of discounts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We obtain a proprietary data set of all marketable orders routed to one or more wholesalers in May 2022 to study wholesaler execution quality. Contrary to conventional wisdom, external liquidity is used to fill 28.6% of the shares in our sample. We find that order size, both absolute and relative to book depth, and recent order imbalance are associated with the decision to source external liquidity. Using a new benchmark, we find the value of both price and size improvement provided to sample orders is 6.5 times greater than the value of price improvement as measured by mandatory monthly Rule 605 reports. Our results indicate that price improvement is not the only measure that should be used when evaluating the relative benefits of the current market structure to alternatives.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04156 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine effects on productivity, employment, and debt outcomes among college students whose parents reside in areas that experience financial shocks caused by natural disasters. After shocks, treated students exhibit poorer academic performance. To boost the impaired grade point average, these students sacrifice educational content by withdrawing from more courses and enrolling in fewer STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) courses. Effects are stronger for middle class students likely relying on family income to pay for college. Students mostly mitigate financial shocks with additional part-time employment. Ultimately, disrupted students are 10% more likely to default on student loans. Overall, these results shed light on the effects of financial stress on the intensive margin of human capital formation.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02977 .</content>

    <title>Tenant Riskiness, Contract Length, and the Term Structure of Commercial Leases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the connection between tenant riskiness, commercial lease length, and the term structure of lease contracts. Theory shows that the possibility of default on a long-term lease generates a risk/lease-length connection. The empirical work uses a large CompStak lease data set combined with tenant characteristics (including risk) from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). Regressions show that lease length is inversely related to the D&amp;B risk measures, as predicted, and that risky tenants pay a higher rent premium for long-term contracts than low-risk tenants. The presence of such tenants thus raises the slope of the term structure of commercial rents.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04959 .</content>

    <title>The Bright Side of Lower Quality: Evidence from Restaurant Exploration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The value derived from hedonic goods is affected by reference effects at the time of consumption, usually in the form of quality standards. Consumption typically involves two steps: First, the consumer chooses a given good, among a pool of available choices; then, the consumer experiences the good and derives a satisfaction from it. Between both steps, consumers might build expectations about the good that might affect the ultimate realized utility. We investigate the role of quality references in this two-stage (choice-outcome) process. We develop a flexible framework for estimating quality references and their effect in choice and outcome that can include consumers’ own past experiences, as well as that of others, and can give salience to more recent or more distant past experiences. Using novel longitudinal data from online restaurant reviews, we find evidence of quality loss aversion in the choice decision stage in accordance with prospect theory. However, in the outcome stage, we do find evidence of the opposite to loss aversion, that is, satisfaction is affected much less than one would expect when going to a lower quality restaurant. This is consistent with consumers adjusting their expectations downward and suggests that expectation adjustment protects consumers when they experience a good of lower-than-reference quality. Our results challenge the implicit assumption made by most recommendation systems that the expectation building process after making a choice does not change the outcome and imply that it may be better to patronize activities by alternating between high- and low-quality choices.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04141 .</content>

    <title>The Power of Posting: An Examination of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; Social Media Celebrity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing prevalence of social media has prompted discussions regarding its impact on the social evaluations of organizational leaders. In this study, we develop the construct of CEO social media celebrity, which arises when a CEO obtains high levels of attention and positive emotional responses from audiences on social media. Building upon parasocial interaction theory, we examine how a CEO's posting influences their likelihood of becoming a social media celebrity. Analyzing 320 S&amp;P 1500 CEOs on X (formerly Twitter) from 2009 to 2021, who posted over 250,000 times and attracted 1.6 mentions from social media users, we find that the volume, positivity, and variety of CEO posts relate positively to CEO social media celebrity attainment, while the uniqueness of their posts shows no such effect. Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that the nature of the CEO's social media posts relates differently to the two dimensions of CEO social media celebrity (i.e., larger audience attention and positive emotional reactions). We offer suggestions for future research to further enrich the understanding of social evaluations in an increasingly digital world and provide practical insights for CEOs seeking to boost their public profile using social media.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between international trade and development in a model where countries differ in their capability, goods differ in their complexity, and capability growth is a function of a country's pattern of specialization. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for international trade to increase capability growth in all countries and, in turn, to push all countries up the development ladder. This occurs if (i) shifting employment towards more complex sectors raises capability growth and if (ii) foreign competition is tougher in less complex sectors for all countries. Empirically, we provide causal evidence consistent with (i) using the entry of countries into the World Trade Organization as an instrumental variable for other countries' patterns of specialization. The opposite of (ii), however, holds in the data. Through the lens of our model, these two empirical observations imply dynamic welfare losses from trade that are pervasive, albeit small for the median country. The same economic forces also suggest that the emergence of China has held back capability growth for a number of African countries who are pushed away from their most-complex sectors, which China exports, and into their least-complex sectors, which China imports.</content>

    <title>Litigation risk and IPO underpricing: evidence from federal judge ideology</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using federal judge ideology as an exogenous measure of issuing firms’ litigation risk, we document that the initial public offerings (IPOs) of the firms headquartered in more liberal circuits are more underpriced. The effect is mitigated when plaintiffs’ pleading standards are more stringent and is amplified when judges have more discretion in their decisions. The effect is also amplified among deep pocketed issuing firms, while it is mitigated among issuing firms hiring reputable intermediaries in the IPO process. The results of additional analysis suggest that issuing firms located in more liberal circuits are more likely to become targets of lawsuits after their IPOs and that these lawsuits are less likely to be dismissed by the courts and result in larger settlements. Collectively, our findings underscore the salience of litigation risk stemming from the issuing firms’ legal environment in driving IPO underpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic led to sharp declines in public transit ridership, resulting in budget shortfalls and service cuts that disproportionately affect vulnerable riders who lack alternative transportation options. Understanding the effect of vaccination on public transportation demand is important for planning for demand recovery as vaccination efforts progress. This study examines this effect, with a particular focus on heterogeneous effects across population groups. Estimating the impact of vaccination is challenging due to a lack of fine-grained data and potential endogeneity issues. To overcome these hurdles, we exploit the distinctive features of the COVID-19 vaccination progress to identify an instrumental variable. By merging the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination data with county-level mobility data, we construct a sample that links vaccination rates to the demand for public transportation and follow the instrumental variable approach to estimate the impact. We show that higher vaccination rates led to increases in public transportation demand, as reflected in mobility data from transit stations. Furthermore, we find the effect of vaccination on public transit demand is 50% greater in counties with a larger uninsured population and 80% greater in counties with a higher share of residents without a college degree. Our findings suggest that as vaccination efforts progress, public transit agencies should proactively strengthen their infrastructure to accommodate the anticipated rise in ridership. A strategic, forward-looking approach will be critical to ensuring a sustainable and effective recovery of public transportation systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As omnichannel operations become increasingly important for meeting diverse customer expectations in retail, continuous innovation in service and business models is essential to maintain a competitive edge. While effective order fulfillment is key to omnichannel success, the manual picking process in physical stores, one of the major driver of fulfillment costs, still offers substantial opportunities for improvement. This paper focuses on thecrowdpickingmodel as an innovative approach to manage online order picking operations in physical stores by leveraging existing in-store customers, offering a business model with considerable potential. We explore the real-time assignment of orders to in-store customers using ML to identify effective assignment policies. These policies are combined with a task-decomposition strategy to reduce picking costs and enhance crowdpicker participation as a key resource. The proposed crowdpicking model and its real-time management framework are tested on real-world data. Our results show that a well-managed crowdpicking system can lower order picking costs by more than 20% and provide actionable insights for managers in designing such systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we define and develop the concept of avant-garde market driving, a process whereby producers transform an industry by rebelling against the status quo as a means of social-industrial critique rather than in response to market demand. Avant-garde market driving is primarily driven by a desire to rebel against the status quo, at the expense of widespread acceptance; it involves a multiplicity of like-minded individuals such as other producers, intermediaries and consumers; it occurs particularly in contexts where like-minded consumers seek hedonic or aesthetic novelty or social distinction. Breaking new ground comes with substantial challenges. How do rebel producers overcome the challenges of introducing radically different products and successfully sustain avant-garde market driving? Analyzing the wine market in France, we find that avant-garde market driving is initiated and sustained by symbolic disruption and vertical collaboration among producers and intermediaries. This process can provide a strategic advantage to smaller, low-status firms. Based on our analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for producers and intermediaries who wish to engage in avant-garde market driving.</content>

Using a semisupervised topic model to extract discourse topics from 7,000,000New York Timesstories spanning 160 years, the war factor predicts the cross section of returns across test assets derived from both traditional and machine learning construction techniques, and spanning 138 anomalies. Our findings are consistent with assets that are good hedges for war risk receiving lower risk premia, or with assets that are more positively sensitive to war prospects being more overvalued. The return premium on the war factor is incremental to standard effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how relative performance evaluation (RPE) affects industry competition—a question relevant for corporate boards interested in incentivizing executives. Using U.S. airline data, we estimate a dynamic game of competition between heterogeneous firms in an oligopolistic market, with managers incentivized by RPE contracts. While RPE can induce a firm to compete more intensely by smoothing compensation, it also amplifies a firm’s cost efficiency relative to its peers and can weaken competition from inefficient firms. The first effect dominates in small markets and the second in median-sized markets. RPE has little effect in large, highly profitable markets.</content>

    <title>An Empirical Study of Strategic Opacity in Crowdsourced Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowd-voting mechanisms are commonly used to implement scalable evaluations of crowdsourced creative submissions. Unfortunately, the use of crowd-voting also raises the potential for gaming and manipulation. Manipulation is problematic because (1) submitters’ motivation depends on their belief that the system is meritocratic, and (2) manipulated feedback may undermine learning, as submitters seek to learn from received evaluations and those of peers. In this work, we consider a design approach to addressing the issue, focusing on the notion of strategic opacity, i.e., purposefully obfuscating evaluation procedures. On the one hand, opacity may reduce the incentive and thus the prevalence of vote manipulation, and submitters may instead dedicate that time and effort to improving their submission quantity or quality. On the other hand, because opacity makes it difficult for submitters to discern the returns to legitimate effort, submitters may also reduce their submission effort or simply exit the market. We explored this tension via a multimethod study employing field experiments at 99designs and a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observed consistent results across all experiments: opacity leads to reductions in gaming in these crowdsourcing contests and significant increases in the allocation of effort toward legitimate vs. illegitimate activities, with no discernible influence on contest participation. We discuss boundary conditions and the implications for contest organizers and contest platform operators.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A slowdown in revenue growth, referred to as revenue stall in this study, is a key concern for any firm. We examine how information technology-producing firms (i.e., IT firms) differ from non-IT firms in experiencing revenue stall and in benefiting from R&amp;D investments in terms of reduced revenue stall. We hypothesize that whereas IT firms experience more revenue stall than non-IT firms, R&amp;D investments reduce revenue stall to a greater extent in IT firms than in non-IT firms. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of more than 1,400 large public firms in the United States from 1950 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses. Consistent with the theoretical arguments underlying our hypotheses, we also find that IT firms experience higher competition, dynamism, and turbulence, and have higher intangible assets than non-IT firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The research on online social movements generally concludes that collective identity, i.e., the sense of we-ness that individual protesters in a movement share, is not only unattainable but also dispensable, even though it is considered a defining feature of traditional movements. In this paper, we explore one of the boundary conditions of these findings, namely the riskiness of protest practices. Analysing the high-risk social movement, My Stealthy Freedom (MySF), which contests compulsory hijab in Iran in a way that hybridizes online and offline protest practices, we show that a sense of collectiveness can be instantiated in online social movements, why it is critical to the success of high-risk activism, and how it is (re)produced. Comparing and contrasting three instantiations of MySF, each of which was enacted on a different social media platform, we develop a theoretical model of how feelings of collectiveness are enacted in high-risk online activism. In addition to providing guidance for online movements where collective identity is desirable, our study challenges prior research on online activism by theorizing the role of embodiment, affect, and the dialectic between activists’ personal and the movement’s collective identity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As AI becomes integral to enterprise decision-making, this study explores the collaborative dynamics between managers and AI systems, focusing on human willingness to delegate tasks to AI. Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employed a hidden Markov model in a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We found that there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time—in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings.</content>

    <title>The Complementor’s Dilemma: Navigating Growth Ambitions and the Dependency on Focal Actors in Platform Ecosystems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on platform ecosystems increasingly recognizes that nonfocal actors such as complementors may have growth ambitions. Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from nonfocal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the nonfocal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. Referring to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, we unpack the process whereby a nonfocal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examined the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a nonfocal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem.</content>

    <title>Mobile Advertising in Distracted Environments: Exploring the Impact of Distractions on Dual-Task Interference</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is increasingly common for consumers to engage with various tasks on their personal devices amid other distractions such as watching television at home, shopping at malls, or attending concerts. While this split in attention poses challenges, it also opens valuable opportunities for advertisers to strategically push targeted advertisements based on information about the user’s environment. Across a series of controlled lab experiments using a custom app developed for this study, we demonstrate how marketers can optimize pop-up advertising on consumers’ personal devices within distraction-filled environments. In doing so, we extend traditional insights from dual-task interference studies that have previously focused on corresponding tasks in isolation, without considering any stimuli from the environment. Our results indicate that, in the presence of additional stimuli from the environment, a facilitating relationship exists between the attention paid to a task and the effectiveness of pop-up advertisements interrupting the task. However, this relationship is moderated by the extent of attention diffusion from the environment. As the distance between the task and the environment increases, consumer attention to the task is more diffused, resulting in poorer encoding of the pop-up advertisements. Critically, optimizing the content and timing of pop-up advertisements to the environmental content can significantly improve their effectiveness. Our results have important implications for helping marketers develop actionable strategies for mobile advertising in distraction-filled environments.</content>

    <title>Automating in High-Expertise, Low-Label Environments: Evidence-Based Medicine by Expert-Augmented Few-Shot Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many real-world process automation environments are rife with high-expertise and limited labeled data. We propose a computational design science artifact to automate systematic review (SR) in such an environment. SR is a manual process that collects and synthesizes data from medical literature to inform medical decisions and improve clinical practice. Existing machine learning solutions for SR automation suffer from a lack of labeled data and a misrepresentation of the high-expertise manual process. Motivated by humans’ impressive capability to learn from limited examples, we propose a principled and generalizable few-shot learning framework—FastSR—to automate the multistep, expertise-intensive SR process using minimal training data. Informed by SR experts’ annotation logic, FastSR extends the traditional few-shot learning framework by including (1) various representations to account for diverse SR knowledge, (2) attention mechanisms to reflect semantic correspondence of medical text fragments, and (3) shared representations to jointly learn interrelated tasks (i.e., sentence classification and sequence tagging). We instantiated and evaluated FastSR on three test beds: full-text articles from Wilson disease (WD) and COVID-19, as well as a public dataset (EBM-NLP) containing clinical trial abstracts on a wide range of diseases. Our experiments demonstrate that FastSR significantly outperforms several benchmarking solutions and expedites the SR project by up to 65%. We critically examine the SR outcomes and practical advantages of FastSR compared to other ML and manual SR solutions and propose a new FastSR-augmented protocol. Overall, our multifaceted evaluation quantitatively and qualitatively underscores the efficacy and applicability of FastSR in expediting SR. Our results have important implications for designing computational artifacts for automating/augmenting processes in high-expertise, low-label environments.</content>

    <title>The Interplay Between Healthcare Information Technologies and Denied Claims</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of health information technology (HIT) in reducing claim denials, which are a significant burden for healthcare providers in the U.S. We theorize the impacts of electronic health records (EHRs) on claim denials, starting with an examination of EHR adoption and followed by a deeper assessment of how EHRs are sourced both within a hospital and across hospitals in the same health system. We propose that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. Using a large-scale dataset of claim records from the state of Maryland from 2012-2016, we found that the greater the EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, our findings suggest that EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observed a decrease in claim denials when physicians previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multifaceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance.</content>

    <title>Does Ransomware Make Investors “WannaCry”? On Investors’ Divergent Reactions to Ransomware Hits and Near Misses</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, ransomware has become one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with successful attacks causing severe operational disruptions and staggering damages. Rationally speaking, investors should react negatively to firms’ ransomware disclosures, but this may not always be the case. Based on norm theory, we describe a paradoxical phenomenon wherein investors exhibit negative reactions to ransomware hits (i.e., events that led to operational disruptions) but positive reactions to near misses (i.e., events in which operational disruptions were narrowly avoided). The positive reactions occur due to an outcome bias in which near-miss events—events that are objectively negative but less severe than expected—are viewed positively instead of negatively. We tested these predictions by reporting on an investigation of stock market reactions to disclosures of ransomware hits vs. near misses. To do so, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of ransomware incidents disclosed by U.S. public firms. Using the event study method, we estimated abnormal stock market returns and found evidence in support of our predictions. First, in line with expectations, ransomware hits that led to the expected severe impact resulted in stock price drops of -4.40%. However, near misses, where disruptions were avoided, were rewarded with gains of 2.87%, confirming positive instead of negative reactions. This offers new insights into investors’ biased responses to certain cybersecurity incidents. These positive reactions, however, represent a call for caution because, albeit seemingly favorable, they mask underlying risks.</content>

    <title>Do Digital Platforms Improve the Performance of Nonbinding Contracts? Evidence From the Amazon Freight Platform</title>
    <updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how digital platforms influence the performance of nonbinding contracts. Businesses in many industries with high uncertainty, such as trucking freight and construction, simultaneously use nonbinding contracts, which impose no legal sanctions for refusals, and spot markets, which facilitate real-time, flexible transactions with market-determined prices. Understanding the conditions under which nonbinding contracts perform is a major concern in these industries. Leveraging the entry of the Amazon Freight platform in the trucking freight industry, we demonstrate that adding a digital platform-enabled spot marketplace improves the performance of nonbinding contracts. We identified several mechanisms driving this effect: (1) expanding carriers’ transportation capacity, (2) lowering spot market prices, and (3) reducing shippers’ reliance on nonbinding contracts for shorter-haul truckloads. Moreover, the digital platform’s impact on enhancing nonbinding contract performance is particularly pronounced in markets with volatile demand and shorter hauls. This research contributes to understanding the impacts of digital platforms in highly uncertain industries that simultaneously use nonbinding contracts and spot markets. Our findings provide implications to policymakers and business managers on leveraging digital platforms to improve operational efficiency in highly uncertain industries.</content>

    <title>Augmented Reality at Work: Attention Management and Its Impact on Work Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Augmented reality (AR) is rapidly emerging as a transformative display technology, blending computer-generated content with the real-world environment in real time. Using divided attention theory, this study investigates how different information delivery channels (i.e., AR vs. mobile phone) and the nature of information (i.e., dependence on specific physical context and complexity) affect work performance. A field experiment in the aircraft maintenance context demonstrates that the effect on work performance of providing information via AR vs. a mobile phone is mediated by work attentiveness. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of AR is particularly pronounced when information is highly dependent on the specific physical context but diminishes when information complexity is high. This research deepens our understanding of how presenting information directly in front of users’ eyes (i.e., via AR) affects their attention management and work performance. The findings have significant implications for firms in terms of how to leverage AR to enhance work performance in industrial settings.</content>

    <title>Organizing for AI Innovation: Insights From an Empirical Exploration of U.S. Patents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations is on the rise, firms frequently report failures and setbacks in their development and implementation of AI innovation efforts. One common issue behind many failing AI initiatives is that they are organized just like other information technology (IT) innovation efforts. To elucidate why and how the production of AI and IT innovations may need to be managed differently, this study juxtaposes these two types of innovations based on two key dimensions of the Schumpeterian framework: the form (product vs. process) and magnitude (radical vs. incremental) of innovations. By analyzing a matched sample of AI and IT patents, we found robust evidence that AI innovations are less radical and more process oriented than comparable IT innovations. Drawing upon our empirical discovery, we developed a conceptual framework to suggest a new way to think about organizing AI innovation. Our research contributes to the literature and practice on AI innovation by illuminating the comparative differences between AI innovations and other IT innovations and advancing a set of empirically derived propositions on how firms may be able to better manage their AI innovation activities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial is inspired by a growing concern within the information systems (IS) community that novelty has become a dominant criterion for publication, despite being unevenly interpreted and poorly specified. In our editorial experience, when authors are told that their papers lack novelty, they often receive little concrete guidance on what precisely counts as novelty, how it varies across paradigms, or how it should be balanced with rigor and relevance.</content>

    <title>Fake News and True News Assessment: The Persuasive Effect of Discursive Evidence in Judging Veracity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals are often unable to assess the veracity of news claims—especially on social media platforms. Recent research has suggested that interventions indicating normative signals, such as flagging false claims, are not always effective. We propose an approach in which users are provided with discursive evidence to consider in determining the veracity of claims rather than depending on normative true or false flags. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different forms of discursive evidence on individual judgments of the veracity of news claims. We found that providing such evidence can significantly improve individuals’ judgment of both true and false news claims—with certain caveats. Providing discursive evidence with high evidence strength leads to a general increase in veracity judgment. Discursive evidence containing items with lower evidence strength may shift believability— thus improving judgments for either true or false claims but degrading them for the other. We also identify important asymmetries between true and false claims, finding that the effect of some evidence may be improved if people are in a more critical mindset—for example, by priming them to think about the concept of truth and lies. Taken together, these results extend knowledge on the problem of fake news and may suggest effective approaches to address the problem without diminishing attention to true news.</content>

    <title>Engaging Physicians with Introductory Incentives: References to Online and Offline Income</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incentives make or break user contributions. While providing introductory incentives to attract new users has become increasingly popular among online communities, their impact on user contributions remains largely unknown. Utilizing a policy change that doubled the incentives paid to physicians in a leading online health community, we examined the impacts of both the initiation and the termination of such introductory incentives on physician contributions (in terms of patient consultations) and how the impacts varied according to the physician’s online and offline income. We found that despite an increase in physician contributions during the policy window, the introductory incentives unintentionally decreased physician contributions after the policy window ended. Additionally, physicians tended to anchor their contributions using their online rather than offline income as a reference point, suggesting that mental accounting was at play. Our findings provide a cautionary perspective on the unintended consequences of using introductory incentives and reveal the associated mechanisms of mental accounting when users make contributions (or not) to online communities. These findings provide important implications for incentive design and user engagement in online communities.</content>

    <title>Dancing to the #Challenge: The Effect of TikTok on Closing the Artist Gender Gap in the Music Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how “Hashtag Dance Challenges” (HDCs), a phenomenon popularized on the short-video platform TikTok, are instrumental in helping music artists gain traction in the digital music marketplace. HDCs represent an appealing combination of music and dance, designed to engage users and achieve virality, thereby benefiting artists whose music is featured. This research focuses on how HDCs contribute to the success of women artists, as compared to men, in an industry known for its diversity but challenged by gender inclusivity. We apply role congruity theory to posit that women artists are in a better position to derive benefits from being featured on HDCs, relative to male artists, particularly in cases of gender concordance—when both the creator and the artist are women. We measure the benefits of HDCs using daily changes in the artist’s followership on Spotify, a leading music streaming service, and test our hypotheses using song and artist-level data collected from Spotify and TikTok. We found that artists featured in a new HDC achieve a significant increase in followership on Spotify, relative to similar artists not featured in an HDC. Further, we observed that women creators drive this effect, enhancing the daily growth of Spotify followers by approximately 3% more for women artists, underscoring the value of gender concordance. Our findings shed light on the role of short videos, especially through the vehicle of HDCs, in advancing women artists, while also promoting inclusivity within the digital music industry.</content>

    <title>The global sourcing of green products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent years have seen a rise in global trade of “green products”—those designed to minimize environmental harm compared to traditional alternatives. In this study, we examine the relevance of pollution haven effects—i.e., shifts of production toward countries with less stringent environmental standards—in firms’ global sourcing strategies for green products. Given the importance of credible and sustainable manufacturing practices in firms’ global value chains for green products, we expect that country environmental standards shape global sourcing decisions for green versus non-green products differently. Our findings using data on global imports and exports for more than 5000 distinct products over the 2002–2019 period show that green products are more likely to be sourced from countries with higher environmental stringency, whereas non-green product sourcing patterns align with prior research, which emphasizes the appeal of lower environmental standards and cost-efficiency. This green sourcing effect is stronger for consumer-facing products and for sourcing into countries where consumer engagement in environmentalism is higher and non-governmental organizations are more active. Unlike prior research that implies that higher environmental standards hurt exporters, our results suggest that such standards can benefit green product exporters.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rise of environmental concerns in recent decades, many companies have joined the initiative to advertise and promote sustainable consumption. The current research examines how providing sustainability cues to consumers might have unintended consequences of which practitioners and policymakers may not be fully aware. One pilot study and ten main studies, including two real-choice studies, show that a sustainability cue may delay consumption. That is, in an intertemporal choice, a sustainability cue can increase preference for a larger-later option over a smaller-sooner option. This effect occurs because a sustainability cue shifts a consumer’s temporal focus toward the future, leading to a shorter perceived wait time for the larger-later option. The findings further show that the delay does not emerge among those with strong green consumption values and can be circumvented if firms communicate the immediate need or instant payoff of sustainable actions. By investigating how sustainability cues shift consumer preferences between two options separated in time, the current research contributes to the literature on both sustainable consumption and intertemporal choice. The findings offer practitioners and policymakers guidelines to nudge consumers’ sustainable consumption more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model populism as the dissemination of a false “alternative reality,” according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism. (JEL D72, D82, D83)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We demonstrate that predictable uninformed cash flows forecast aggregate market stock returns. Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9. These results suggest price pressure is a widespread result of flows, not an anomaly. (JEL G12, G14, G35)</content>

    <title>Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This “offset” policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A nested bundling strategy creates menus in which more expensive bundles include all the goods of less expensive ones. We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles. (JEL D11, D21, D42, D82, M31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the long-term effect of public R&amp;D on growth in manufacturing by analyzing new data from the Cold War–era space race. We develop a novel empirical strategy that leverages US-Soviet rivalry in space technology to isolate windfall R&amp;D spending. Our results demonstrate that public R&amp;D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors. While migration responses were important, they were not sufficient to generate a wedge between local and national effects. The iconic moonshot R&amp;D program had only modest economic effects for both the local and national space-related sectors. (JEL E22, H54, L60, N12, N42, N62, O47)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Supplemental Security Income program uses a birth weight cutoff at 1,200 grams to determine eligibility. Using birth certificates linked to administrative records, we find low-income families of infants born just below the cutoff receive higher monthly cash benefits (equal to 27 percent of family income) at ages 0–2 with smaller benefits continuing through age 10. Yet we detect no improvements in health care use and mortality in infancy, nor in health and human capital outcomes as observed through young adulthood for these infants. We also find no improvements for their older siblings. (JEL I12, I13, I18, I38, J13, J14, J31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment to quantify the impact of the lifting of the Saudi women's driving ban on women's employment by randomizing rationed spaces in driver's training. Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women. The results underscore the importance of intrahousehold responses that can counteract legal gains in women's freedoms. (JEL C93, D13, J16, J22, K38, O15, O17)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many US colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that “society” dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its “disagreement cost.” We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2. (JEL D31, H24, H31, J22, J31, J62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March 2020, safe asset markets experienced surprising and unprecedented price crashes. We explain how strategic investor behavior can create such market fragility in a model with investors valuing safety, investors valuing liquidity, and constrained dealers. While safety investors and liquidity investors can form a symbiotic relationship with offsetting trades during times of stress, strategic interactions among liquidity investors harbor the potential for self-fulfilling fragility. When the market is fragile, standard flight-to-safety can have a destabilizing effect and trigger a “dash-for-cash” by liquidity investors. Well-designed policy interventions can reduce market fragility ex ante and restore orderly functioning ex post.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a panel of over 28,400 S&amp;P 500 return forecasts by CFOs to examine whether the extent of CFOs’ miscalibration—providing forecast confidence intervals that are too narrow—decreases over time. We find no improvement with task repetition or evidence of learning, that is, no improvement in response to past performance. Across CFOs, miscalibration appears to be a persistent personal trait. We find some evidence that the degree of miscalibration is related to birth cohort and stock market familiarity. (JEL G41, G30, D22, D83, D84)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A primary argument against fair value measurement is the lack of verifiability, where verifiability is defined as consensus in measurement by independent parties. We evaluate this argument by investigating trends in the consensus of reported fair values. Our findings indicate that consensus increased between 2005 and 2019, as evidenced by reductions in the fair value range and standard deviation. Further analyses suggest that enhanced data availability—driven by public dissemination of trade information—serves as a mechanism for this trend. We also document that securities subject to testing by larger external auditors with more resources to take advantage of enhanced data availability are associated with a stronger trend in increasing consensus. Finally, this trend appears to be stronger in situations when management has a heightened opportunity to record a biased estimate. While conventional arguments express concern over management’s ability to manipulate fair values, our results demonstrate patterns consistent with improved verifiability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Are More Information Details Less Useful? A Comparison of Product Contextualization in Customer Images and Review Texts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product reviews, a type of user-generated content (UGC), are found to affect sales; however, their impact on product returns has not been fully explored. Research has revealed that inflated ratings and catchy product images may increase returns, which spells trouble for sellers. To address the issue, we examine howproduct contextualizationin user-posted images and review texts helps online shoppers assess a product’sfunctionalityandaestheticsand, in turn, reduce returns. Using the archival data from an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer, we reveal that contextual cues in UGC help decrease product returns. When comparing the roles of image with text, we explore distinct mechanisms for shoppers’ utilization of contextual cues to assess each type of product feature. For functionality, the level of detail in writing suggests that contextual information for these attributes (e.g., the warmth, stretchability, and water-resistance of a jacket) is likely better delineated in text than image since many of them are measurable (e.g., temperature), can be depicted in subtleties (e.g., running vs. jogging), and, sometimes, on a time dimension (e.g., a two-hour rain). As a result, shoppers’ product evaluation and return decisions are more likely to be influenced by such content. However, our data analysis shows the opposite. Although shoppers perceive verbal contextual cues for these product features as more accurate, detailed, and sufficient, they prefer to use images to assess such attributes because the cost of processing visual information is lower. Regarding aesthetics, since buyers often adopt a sensory-based strategy to evaluate these features (e.g., the design of a shirt), images are likely to be a preferred choice. We find evidence for this argument. Yet, when a product’s aesthetics are closely tied to its geometric fit (e.g., sleeve length), contextual cues in the text have a stronger effect on returns. We offer business insights on leveraging UGC to enhance operating cost management by reducing product returns.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Targeted Automation and Sustaining Human-AI Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many decision processes, a decision maker or planner must review and optionally adjust the recommendations that are generated by a decision support system (DSS). When the DSS is well-tuned to its task, adjustments by a planner can be rare and may even degrade the DSS’s performance. Targeted automation could address these inefficiencies by predicting whether a planner will adjust a recommendation and improve the performance of the system. The remaining recommendations can be automated. However, as more recommendations are automated, fewer will receive planner input. This may starve the prediction model of the observations it needs for retraining. To maintain predictive performance, we must therefore address the loss that automation imposes on the model’s ability to learn from a planner’s decisions over time. Using four years of procurement ordering data from our research partner, a large materials handling equipment manufacturer, we develop and train a series of machine learning classifiers that predict individual instances in which a planner will improve a DSS-generated procurement order decision. We mitigate the performance erosion that automation engenders by structuring the selection of the model’s classification threshold similar to a newsvendor problem, accounting for the value of learning and balancing the costs and benefits of under or over automating. In our setting, this approach automates around 84% of all DSS recommendations while retaining three times more planner improvements than random automation. The models maintain their predictive performance over time, despite losing automated outcomes for retraining and substantial dataset shift. Our research contributes to a broader debate on the allocation of decision authority between humans and algorithms, and creates a framework for targeted automation in an operational setting that balances the net benefits of automation versus the long-term benefits of algorithmic learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore a form of postacquisition integration by which inventors from the target and acquiring organizations share and integrate technological and organizational knowledge, performing joint research and development. We refer to this phenomenon as inventor commingling. Grounded in the knowledge-based view, we posit that commingling enhances the target firm’s innovation performance by enabling the transfer of the acquirer’s organizational knowledge, preserving the target’s existing knowledge base. We explore how commingling differs from structural integration and how the two forms of integration can be combined for postacquisition management. We posit that commingling diminishes the negative effects of structural integration, whereas structural integration may enhance the efficacy of commingling. Because organizational knowledge is firm-specific and cumulative, commingling efficacy should increase with acquirer commingling inventors’ tenure. To test these predictions, we assemble a large sample of acquisitions to study the effect of these forms of postacquisition integration on acquired entity innovation outcomes. Our results support a positive commingling innovation effect, which is more pronounced under structural integration. A high degree of commingling can mitigate the negative effects of postacquisition structural integration documented in the literature. We use direct flights between the acquisition party locations as an instrument to address the potentially endogenous process of inventor commingling. We find consistent results. Our study raises the possibility of inventor commingling as a distinct form of postacquisition integration, which holds the potential of effectively transferring organizational knowledge and supporting postacquisition innovation output, sidestepping the classic postacquisition integration–autonomy trade-off.Funding: This work was supported by Henry Crown Institute of Business Research at Tel-Aviv University; Mack Institute for Innovation Management at Wharton; Wharton Global Initiatives Research Funding Program.</content>

    <title>Seeing Both Sides: How Shared Experience Can Improve Entrepreneur Evaluations of Investors Through Perceived Empathy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarly attention in the venture funding literature is primarily devoted to tie selection, with a great deal of that attention focused on the perspective of the investor evaluating the entrepreneur as a candidate for funding. But venture funding can be conceptualized as a long-term, dual-sided matching process. Two mixed methods studies offer support for a specific basis of background similarity that can influence entrepreneur evaluations of investor tie potential: shared entrepreneurial experience. An archival study of 677 entrepreneurs evaluating 408 investors demonstrates that investors with entrepreneurial experience are more likely to be perceived as empathetic than investors without this experience. In turn, entrepreneurs rate investors whom they perceive to be empathetic more favorably than those they do not perceive to be empathetic. Perceived empathy thus emerges as a mechanism that serves to mediate the positive relationship between shared entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneur ratings of investors. A preregistered between-subjects experiment conducted on 481 entrepreneurs exposed to otherwise comparable investor profiles randomized for experience complements the correlational evidence from the archival study with causal support for each of these paths. Shedding light on the key components of perceived empathy, linguistic analyses indicate the extent to which cognitive perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur thinks) and affective perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur feels) mediate the effect. Gender implications are discussed as this work also documents that women are less likely to traverse the path from entrepreneurship into investing, restricting their ability to reap these relational upsides.Funding: This research was supported by faculty budgets at London Business School and Georgetown University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18429 .</content>

    <title>Round Number Preferences and Left-Digit Bias: Evidence from Credit Card Repayments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine round number preferences and left-digit bias in credit card repayments. We show half of all manual credit card payments are at a small set of round-number values, although all values between the statement minimum and balance were permissible. We use minimum payments, which place a floor on the payment value, to measure the strength of rounding behavior in a natural experiment. We find that when the minimum payment level just rules out a round number from the bottom of the range of possible repayment (e.g., a minimum payment of £50.01 just rules out a payment of £50.00), payments at the next round number jump by 15%–20% (e.g., payments at £60.00). That is, in response to a smooth increase in minimum payments, the selected payments jump up a ladder of round numbers when each lower rung is removed. We also see a classic—although nuanced—left digit bias. When the balance increases such that the left digit changes (e.g., from £1,999 to £2,000), payments in full drop by 3%–8% as if an increase in the left digit makes the balance seem much larger. But average repayments increase by 10%–15%, as smaller partial repayments are all dragged up the ladder rungs. This preference for a small set of round numbers as payment values and this effect of left digit bias on the level of repayment have policy implications. Rounding could be used by policy makers to encourage faster paydown of credit card debt, using one-click “rounds-ups,” defaults, or shrouding. These policy options could deliver interest savings of up to 40%.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [Grants ES/K002201/1, ES/N018192/1, ES/P008976/1, and ES/V004867/1] and the Leverhulme [Grant RP2012-V-022].

    <title>Does Trading Spur Specialization? Evidence from Patenting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the market for technology (facilitated by the establishment of patent exchanges in China) affects innovation specialization. We find that the market for technology induces (i) specialization between patent buyers and sellers, (ii) specialization between patent licensors and licensees, and (iii) specialization based on a firm’s research and development efficiency. All these three specialization patterns indicate that the market for technology promotes comparative advantage–based innovation specialization. Firms with a comparative advantage in creating innovation redirect their resources toward producing patents, whereas firms with a comparative advantage in commercializing innovation switch their effort toward launching new products. A firm also shrinks its scope of innovation and invents in technological fields with greater proximity. Financial friction hampers innovation specialization and relieving trading friction in the market for technology mitigates such negative consequences.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of student loan forbearance on job search outcomes. Our experimental setting is the 2020 federal student loan moratorium that provided some borrowers with forbearance by pausing the payments on their student loans. We use data on unemployment insurance claims, payroll records, and credit histories to compare unemployed borrowers who received forbearance to unemployed borrowers who had to continue making payments. We find that the payment pause did not have any economically or statistically significant effects on job search durations or subsequent incomes. Further, we find no heterogeneity in these effects across borrowers’ financial, demographic, or labor market characteristics.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04047 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm disclosures are mostly unstructured and textual, imposing substantial processing costs on investors. We examine firms’ incentives to enhance the accessibility of these disclosures by expending resources to make them easier for investors to process. We show that an equilibrium with a positive supply of accessibility can be difficult to sustain—even though investors view accessibility as a favorable signal of firm productivity. We further explore how the supply of accessibility interacts with the quality of the numerical (easier-to-analyze) signals and textual (harder-to-analyze) disclosures. Our analysis generates predictions consistent with empirical evidence and offers a framework for evaluating policy initiatives and accounting standards aimed at improving accessibility.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Homing Alliances and Price Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OTT subscription video streaming industry has witnessed significant growth and heightened competition in recent years, marked by the influx of new players. At the same time, we are observing an interesting phenomenon where competing services are forming new alliances that facilitate consumer multi-homing. For instance, Amazon Prime Video has partnered with services, such as (HBO) MAX and Paramount+, to enhance the combined viewing experience for consumers through seamless integration. We build a game-theoretic model with horizontally differentiated services to examine how an alliance facilitating multi-homing between two competing services affects price competition in the market. We find that the alliance’s impact on price competition depends on the level of content differentiation in the market – competition intensifies when differentiation is high but relaxes when differentiation is low. The alliance benefits the partnering services as long as the differentiation is not too high, and interestingly, may increase the profitability of a third non-partnering service when differentiation is sufficiently low. We show that consumer surplus increases under the alliance, even if price competition is relaxed. We also investigate a focal service’s decision to partner with one of two competing services and show that it prefers partnering with a service that has high quality content but a smaller loyal base. Our research offers insights into the current landscape of the OTT video streaming market and provides implications for both managers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Pick-the-Winner-Picker Heuristic: Preference for Categorically Correct Forecasts</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People routinely make decisions based on predictions made by others (e.g., political pundits, market analysts), so it is in their best interest to identify high-quality forecasts. Experts characterize good forecasting as minimization of continuous error (i.e., predictions close to the eventual outcome). By contrast, the present work reveals that laypeople typically see good forecasts as those that correctly predict an event’s categorical outcome (e.g., the winning team). Using within-subjects, between-subjects, and incentive-compatible designs, fifteen studies demonstrate this “pick-the-winner-picker heuristic” as well as its psychological mechanism: People evaluate forecasts by assigning separate weights to (a) categorical correctness and (b) continuous error minimization, depending on the overall importance of the categorical and continuous dimensions for that situation. Thus, in the common case when the categorical dimension matters most (e.g., sports contests), people prize forecasts that accurately predicted the categorical outcome (e.g., the winner, not the margin of victory). However, when the categorical dimension’s stakes are experimentally reduced, an attenuation is observed. While this describes how people typically evaluate forecasts, crucially, a dimension’s importance is not necessarily related to its diagnosticity of forecaster skill or reliability. Accordingly, the pick-the-winner-picker heuristic may constitute a normative mistake, while framing manipulations help debias judgments.</content>

    <title>Routine Dynamics at a Cardiac First‐Aid Unit: How Context, Emotions, and Identities Drive the Adaptation of Action Patterns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emotions are a catalyst for actions. They are therefore important for developing an understanding of organizational routines as generative patterns of interdependent actions. To investigate how the performances and action patterns of routines are impacted by emotion changes brought about by alterations in the context of routine enactment, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry centring on a diagnostic routine at a hospital's cardiac first‐aid unit. Our findings show that context changes from off‐peak to peak times and vice versa engendered differences in the emotions of doctors and nurses because of, respectively, conformity and non‐conformity between their salient identities and their situated experiences. This triggered actions that produced variation in routine performances and action patterns. Drawing on our findings, we present a grounded model that theorizes two complementary emotions and identity‐linked mechanisms that explain variety and stability in action patterns. We discuss the theoretical contributions and implications of our model and findings for research on routine dynamics.</content>

    <title>The Inclusionary Effects of Performing Work: A Practice‐Theoretical Study of Airport Security Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In contrast to inclusion research that often treats work as a neutral, passive background, this study theorizes the active role of work in producing an inclusive organization. We adopt a practice‐theoretical approach that examines the accomplishment of work activities through their discourses, embodiment, and material arrangements, critically analysing both their inclusionary and exclusionary effects. Through an ethnographic study of an airport security company, we found that performing work along the ends of safety and hospitality played a crucial role in the local, situated formation of a collective of employees, recognition of individual contribution, and emergence of egalitarian relationships among security agents. Building on these findings, we discuss how the enactment of work‐related ends can serve as a key place for inclusion interventions, highlighting the concept of ‘horizon of intelligible actions’ as a central explanation. Furthermore, we emphasize how the interconnectedness – the nexus – of work activities as well as material arrangements are crucial in reinforcing or undermining inclusionary and exclusionary effects.</content>

    <title>Single paper meta‐analysis is unavoidable</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advocate that the multiple studies of a common phenomenon that are featured in a typical behavioral research paper be jointly analyzed to provide a statistical summary of the set of studies as a whole. Indeed, we view such single paper meta‐analysis as unavoidable in typical behavioral research papers because (i) such papers feature multiple studies of a common phenomenon, (ii) such papers contain summaries of those studies, and (iii) statistical summaries of studies (i.e., meta‐analyses) are superior to non‐statistical summaries of them. Nonetheless, the current dominant practice is for such papers to feature separate statistical analyses of the data from each of the studies but to contain a non‐statistical summary of the multiple studies rather than a statistical summary. We believe that this is regrettable and therefore aim to rectify matters. Consequently, we review some considerations about meta‐analysis and statistical analysis more broadly; compare single paper meta‐analysis to traditional meta‐analysis and illustrate its benefits via a case study; discuss and dismiss concern about single paper meta‐analysis; and discuss single paper meta‐analysis and the review process.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <title>Executive Pay Cuts and Executive Turnover</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of executive pay cuts on executive turnover. While previous research has largely focused on the drivers of pay increases of top management team (TMT) members or the effects of their relative pay standing on executive behavior, the prevalence and consequences of pay cuts have received limited attention. Drawing on temporal comparison theory, I argue that executive pay cuts are positively associated with executive turnover. I then propose that the impact of pay cuts on executive turnover depends on contextual cues that influence how executives interpret these cuts. Specifically, I argue that the effect is stronger for salary cuts than for pay‐for‐performance (PFP) cuts. I also argue that the impact of a pay cut is stronger when an executive is paid below the TMT pay level and when few other TMT members experience similar cuts. I test these predictions on a large longitudinal sample of U.S. firms and find empirical support. These results highlight the importance of temporal comparisons in executive pay evaluation processes.</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate public support and venture capital (VC) investment in academic startups. Government support may enable follow‐on investment by providing a quality signal to investors. This signal is especially important for academic startups, which face large funding gaps due to their complexity, cutting‐edge nature, and uncertainty regarding the founders' management capabilities and commitment. Using a panel of startups in Germany, our analyses confirm that academic startups are more likely to obtain follow‐on VC investment after receiving public support than non‐academic startups. Further, this effect is limited in time, lasts longer for academic startups, is concentrated in high‐tech manufacturing firms, and is stronger for investments from business angels. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking to foster academic entrepreneurship through policy programs and VC investment.Managerial SummaryObtaining seed and growth capital is essential for potentially highly innovative startups. We show that startups that obtain public support are more likely to receive VC funding and that this effect is stronger for startups with academic founders, approximately twice as large. We further show that this benefit is limited in time, concentrated in the high‐tech manufacturing industry, and more salient for business angel financing than for investment by independent VC funds or corporate VCs. For founders of academic startups, our results imply that acquiring public support might enhance the chances of attracting follow‐on financing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An entrepreneur’s negative attitude toward debt (debt aversion) affects the financing decisions of the businesses they run. Controlling for a range of observable traits, firms run by highly debt-averse entrepreneurs are about 10 percentage points less likely to use debt. The same entrepreneurs are also almost 25% less likely to take up government-guaranteed debt during the COVID-19 crisis. These firms show less interest in COVID-19 support policies if they perceive them to involve debt based on experiments randomizing the framing and labeling of otherwise nearly identical hypothetical COVID-19 support policies as debt or grants.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.

    <title>Getting the Most Out of A/B Tests Using the Asymptotic Minimax-Regret Criteria</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms conduct A/B tests to find a marketing action that improves a value of interest, such as revenue or profit. We develop the asymptotic minimax regret (AMMR) criterion, a practical decision-theoretic approach for choosing among binary marketing actions based on A/B tests. The AMMR is a general large-sample approximation of the minimax-regret criterion from a frequentist standpoint. Our method directly optimizes the decision-relevant metric, accounting for the product of the error probability and the associated magnitude of value loss. Implementing the AMMR decision rule is straightforward; it comprises simply comparing the standardized treatment-effect estimate to the AMMR-optimal decision threshold. The AMMR suggests selecting the treatment whenever the point estimate is positive, as this minimizes the maximum expected net loss from decision errors. A case study of a mobile game company’s A/B testing with Monte Carlo validation demonstrates that the AMMR decision rule effectively selects the optimal marketing action and improves revenue across various data-generating processes.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: K.

    <title>Understanding Talent in Foreign Subsidiaries: A Review, Synthesis, and Way Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations are strategically important, requiring them to tailor their human capital resources to specific needs. Although talent serves as the micro‐level foundation of subsidiaries' organizational‐level human capital resources and strategic outcomes, the current literature is fragmented and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is known, what remains unknown, and what future research should explore about talent in subsidiaries. To this end, we synthesize the literature on talent in subsidiaries over the past two decades, mapping it onto the model of human capital resources emergence. First, we build on existing classifications by integrating the recognized distinction between headquarters‐assigned or locally hired talent with talent nationality, providing a structured perspective that better reflects the realities of subsidiary talent. Second, we examine how talent's individual knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) and social interactions evolve into four subsidiary‐level human capital resources, which in turn contribute to a variety of strategic subsidiary outcomes. Finally, we conclude our review with a future research agenda.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our paper examines analyst reports and online stock opinion articles that recommend buying stocks which, based on the literature, trade at high prices and earn low future returns (“short-leg securities”). Using a textual analysis, we test whether the justifications primarily (1) emphasize safe-haven qualities, (2) indicate exuberance, or (3) highlight lottery-like features. Our results strongly point to (3). We subsequently validate our text-based inferences through a survey of institutional and retail investors with long positions in short-leg securities. Overall, perceived upside potential appears to play a material role in driving investor demand for stocks in the short legs of anomalies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Binsbergen, Han, and Lopez-Lira (2023) predict analysts’ forecast errors using a random forest model. A strategy that trades against this model’s predictions earns a monthly alpha of 1.54% (t-value = 5.84). This estimate represents a large improvement over studies using classical statistical methods. We attribute the difference to a look-ahead bias. Removing the bias erases the alpha. Linear models yield as accurate forecasts and superior trading profits. Neither alternative machine learning models nor combinations thereof resurrect the predictability. We discuss the state of research into the term structure of analysts’ forecasts and its causal relationship with returns. (JEL G12, G31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study depositor behavior and capital flight using data from the Freedman’s Savings Bank, a bank established after the U.S. Civil War to support formerly enslaved individuals. White depositors, who generally had better access to financial information, begin providing significant funding as interest terms are enhanced. They respond faster to postpanic stabilization efforts and negative bank-specific information, and are twice as likely to close accounts before failure, passing expected losses to Black depositors, who were the bank’s primary philanthropic target. Our results show how demand deposit funding of bank-like institutions can create systemic disadvantages for less experienced borrowers. (JEL G530, N20, O160)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an equilibrium corporate bond pricing model that accommodates the heterogeneity in institutional investors’ preferences and mandates in an empirically tractable way. Our model, estimated on rich holdings data, quantifies investors’ preferences and demand elasticities, with inelastic insurers focusing on the investment-grade segment, and elastic mutual funds substituting across ratings groups. The model offers a novel quantitative perspective of the effect of recent trends in institutional ownership on equilibrium credit spreads and the funding costs of corporations. Overall, our model emphasizes the composition of institutional demand as an important state variable for corporate bond pricing. (JEL G11, G12, G21, G22, G23, G24)</content>

    <title>Cost-Saving Synergy: Energy Stacking in Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the great potential benefits of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to electrical grids, most standalone uses of BESS are not economical due to batteries’ high upfront costs and limited lifespans. Energy stacking, a strategy of providing two or more services with a single BESS, has been of great interest to improve profitability. However, some key questions, for example, the underlying mechanism by which stacking works or why and how much it may improve profitability, remain unanswered in the literature. Using two popular battery services, we analytically show that there often exists cost-saving synergy—the cost of performing both services at the same time (simultaneous stacking) is smaller than the sum of individual costs if we had performed each service alone—which allows for bigger profits. Furthermore, we perform comparative statics on the optimal mix of the services to systemically characterize grid/market conditions that maximize/minimize this synergy. We also derive a theoretical upper bound on simultaneous stacking’s benefits, showing that it can approximately double the profit of the best standalone service. Several generalizations of the base model not only show that the main lessons continue to hold but also that stacking’s benefits may become even stronger.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03477 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of information technologies has intensified concerns about individual privacy and highlighted the importance of consumer privacy rights. At the same time, these technologies enable significant personalization of communications and offerings. We develop a theory of the effects of privacy based on the concavity of an individual’s derived payoff function with respect to market beliefs: When this function is concave, privacy is valuable. We identify market conditions that lead to concavity or convexity in the derived payoff function. The framework is applied to contexts such as product choice, price discrimination, data breaches, and health insurance.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the social capital embedded in employees’ networks contributes to firm performance. Using novel, individual-level network data, we measure a firm’s social capital derived from employees’ connections with external stakeholders. Our directed network data allow for differentiating those connections that know the employee and those that the employee knows. Results show that firms with more employee social capital perform better; the positive effect stems primarily from employees being known by others. We provide causal evidence exploiting the enactment of a government regulation that imparted a negative shock to networking with specific sectors and provide evidence on the mechanisms.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: D.

    <title>Vestigial Tails? Floor Brokers at the Close in Modern Electronic Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The closing auction is an increasingly important trade mechanism due to the rise of passive funds that require closing price execution. We study differences in auction mechanism design on NYSE and Nasdaq that may affect closing price efficiency. Unlike Nasdaq, NYSE allows late auction orders through its floor brokers, providing traders with more flexibility to mitigate or create large last-minute auction imbalances. Price changes in the closing auction are more likely to reverse on NYSE compared with Nasdaq, suggesting greater price inefficiency in NYSE closing auctions. Larger last-minute abnormal imbalances on NYSE, particularly in stocks where auction competition may be inhibited by relatively high floor broker auction fees, explain these stronger reversals. Evidence from the NYSE floor closure during the COVID-19 pandemic supports a causal interpretation. Our results highlight an important tradeoff between auction flexibility and price efficiency.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00884 .</content>

We use decision trees to endogenously group similar stocks together by selecting optimal portfolio splits to span the stochastic discount factor, projected on individual stocks. Our portfolios are interpretable and well diversified, reflecting many characteristics and their interactions. Compared to combinations of dozens (even hundreds) of single/double sorts, as well as machine‐learning prediction‐based portfolios, our cross‐sections are low‐dimensional yet have up to three times higher out‐of‐sample Sharpe ratios and alphas.</content>

    <title>Surviving as a Vegan in a World of Omnivores: Relational Fractures in Shared Practices</title>
    <updated>2025-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research documents the role of the misalignment of practice elements in practice habituation and change. We extend this literature by demonstrating the understudied role of practice relationality. Locating our empirical work in veganism, a context that encompasses a bundle of interrelated practices, we show how people who adopt veganism manage the relationality of their food-related practices (e.g., eating, cooking, and shopping for food) during shared moments. Building on interview, secondary, and netnographic data on people who pursue veganism, we demonstrate that changes in shared practice performances cause relational fractures. We pinpoint relational fractures that hinder practitioners from smoothly performing shared practices in three contexts: co-performance, co-learning, and the marketplace. To repair practice relationality, vegan consumers enact four relational competences, which we identify as decoding, decoupling, divesting, and chameleoning. These competences can repair some relational fractures while aggravating others. When vegan consumers fail to acquire any competence, however, they end up reverting to their old omnivorous performances. Our paper contributes to practice theory by conceptualizing the role of practice relationality in practices, introducing the concept of relational competence as a necessary element for performance (re)rehabituation, and demonstrating the role of practice intelligibility in the co-performance of shared practices.</content>

    <title>Concealing Prices: How Delayed Price Disclosure Influences Consumer Purchase Decisions</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article presents the first systematic empirical investigation into a longstanding question in retail: Is it better to display prices upfront or reveal them later in the purchase process? Two large-scale field studies demonstrate that delayed price disclosure can either increase or decrease sales. Supporting lab studies reveal that one plausible explanation is that a price delay allows price beliefs to shift consumers’ internal reference prices upward or downward, creating either positive or negative price expectation disconfirmations when prices are revealed. When consumers anticipate prices should be expensive (e.g., from premium brands or upscale stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations upward, making purchases more likely when prices are revealed. Conversely, when consumers anticipate prices should be inexpensive (e.g., sales events or discount stores), a price delay allows price beliefs to shift price expectations downward, making purchases less likely when prices are revealed. Our findings offer retailers actionable insights on when to reveal prices to customers. In doing so, the authors contribute to the literature on price obfuscation and challenge the conventional wisdom that shopping experiences should always minimize friction. (184 words)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent SEC regulations require that qualified hedge fund advisers provide their investors with narrative disclosures of their business and operations. We find that 40% of these disclosures omit or de‐emphasize information regarding advisers' operational and investment risks when compared to other sources of public information. Funds with such “inconsistencies” are associated with predictably lower fund performance but do not differ in their fund flows, flow‐performance relation, ownership structure, or management fees. These results are consistent with investors being subject to limited strategic thinking, which prevents them from fully unraveling the implications of strategic omissions. This, in turn, contributes to advisers' successful use of discretion to de‐emphasize information with adverse performance implications. Our findings suggest that information processing frictions can facilitate nondisclosure, even in markets with sophisticated investors.</content>

    <title>Is Prevention Better Than Cure? Effects of Cyber Risk Disclosures on Shareholder Response to Breaches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As digitalization increases firms’ exposure to cyber risks, corporate disclosures about how these risks are managed are becoming more common and influential. This study examines 1,912 breach incidents affecting public companies to understand how shareholder reactions differ depending on the type of cyber risk strategies disclosed. We find that, although breaches generally lead to stock price declines, firms that previously disclosed preventive strategies, such as efforts to avoid breaches, experience significantly smaller losses in market value. Conversely, disclosing mitigative strategies, focused on damage control after a breach, amplifies the negative impact. These effects arise from shareholders’ loss aversion: They respond more favorably to firms perceived as trying to prevent harm rather than simply reacting to it. These findings suggest that managers should focus cyber risk disclosures on credible, prevention-oriented strategies to build investor confidence and minimize financial fallout after a breach. Additionally, our findings advise against using cyber risk disclosures as tools for impression management. Managers should ensure these disclosures accurately reflect the firm’s cyber risk management practices, as failing to do so can undermine the economic benefits of emphasizing preventive strategies.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: On Value-at-Risk Based Queueing Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we investigate the economics of queueing systems with strategic non-risk-neutral customers, emphasizing the value-at-risk (VaR) framework. It is distinct from the moment-based utility structure of Naor’s model by introducing the maximum loss customers can bear with a certain level of confidence. Such systems are ubiquitous in various domains involving human customers, such as healthcare or security check queues, wherein risk-based performance measures take precedence and hold greater significance. We consider both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases of risk preferences under different information levels. Our findings demonstrate that optimal strategies in observable queueing systems with non-risk-neutral customers exhibit threshold-type behaviors that differ significantly from those observed in risk-neutral customer settings. For unobservable queueing systems, we derive an equilibrium joining probability for homogeneous risk preferences and a multi-dimensional equilibrium joining probability for heterogeneous risk preferences. Interestingly, under the VaR criterion, there is an indifferent action region in the observable queueing model. Customers with risk preferences falling within this region will adopt the same joining strategy. And, in the unobservable scenario, there is an indifference curve for risk preference. Customers on the same indifference curve have the same level of risk preference. Furthermore, we provide a conversion formula that facilitates comparison between two risk preferences with different confidence levels. When exploring social welfare, we use conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to characterize the customer’s excessive losses that lead to potential negative social utility. To distinguish from the classic social welfare function, we term our proposed social welfare function the “CVaR-Based Extended SocialWelfare Function (CVaR-ESW)”. In observable systems with homogeneous risk preferences, the socially optimal CVaR-ESW-based risk preference falls within a “ribbon” region, while in unobservable systems, it forms a curve. We also uncover intriguing insights about the information disclosure. In unobservable situations, the throughput in the model with naively-assessed (NA) customers is always greater than that in the model with precisely-assessed (PA) customers. Based on the differences in risk tolerance values among customers with different risk preferences, we found that, under certain circumstances, NA customers can generate more social welfare, while in other cases, the opposite is true. Overall, this research sheds light on the interplay between VaR-based queueing economics, risk preferences, and strategic customer behavior.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Manufacturer Encroachment in the Presence of Production Economies of Scale</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well established that a manufacturer generally benefits from encroachment with a profitable direct channel and may also benefit from using encroachment as a threat (i.e., without sales in the direct channel); the retailer may also benefit from both encroachment strategies. Our study provides new insights into the manufacturer encroachment literature by considering the upstream manufacturer’s production economies of scale. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that an increasing level of economies of scale may reduce the manufacturer’s profit if the manufacturer encroaches. Furthermore, we find that under strong economies of scale, refraining from encroachment may be the optimal strategy, even if encroachment could increase the manufacturer’s wholesale profit. This finding suggests that a manufacturer may choose not to encroach solely due to profit losses in direct selling. Interestingly, we also find that the manufacturer can benefit from encroachment by maintaining an unprofitable direct channel with sales, provided that the level of economies of scale is below a threshold. Moreover, our findings reveal that the retailer can benefit from manufacturer encroachment only when the level of economies of scale remains below this threshold, and that an increasing level of economies of scale reduces the likelihood that the retailer can benefit.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Don’T Follow RL Blindly: Lower Sample Complexity of Learning Optimal Inventory Control Policies with Fixed Ordering Cost</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the sample complexity of offline learning for a class of structured MDPs describing the inventory control system with fixed ordering cost/setup cost, a fundamental problem in supply chains. We find that a naive plug-in sampling-based approach applied to the inventory MDPs leads to strictly lower sample complexity bounds compared to the optimal bounds recently obtained for the general MDPs. More specifically, in the infinite-horizon discounted cost setting, we obtain anO~(min{(S¯−s_)2(1−γ)2ε2,1(1−γ)4ε2})sample complexity bound, where(S¯−s_)2corresponds to the number of state-action pairs in a generic MDP with state spaceSand action spaceA. As such,O~((S¯−s_)2(1−γ)2ε2)improves on the optimal generic RL boundΘ~((S¯−s_)2(1−γ)3ε2)(when directly applyingΘ~(|S||A|(1−γ)3ε2)here) by a factor of(1−γ)−1, andO~(1(1−γ)4ε2)is able to completely remove the dependence on state and action cardinality. In the infinite-horizon average cost setting, we obtain anO~((S¯−s_)2ε2)bound, improving on the generic optimal RL boundΘ~((S¯−s_)2tmixε2)(when directly applyingΘ~(|S||A|tmixε2)here) by a factor oftmix, and hence removing the mixing time dependence. By carefully leveraging the structural properties of the inventory dynamics in various settings, we are able to improve on those “best-possible” bounds developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. Our results demonstrate the drawbacks one could face by blindly following RL algorithms and the necessity of designing sample efficient algorithms that properly incorporate the special structures of the inventory systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In practice, new entrants often bypass intermediary retailers and engage in direct competition against incumbents. However, this might place entrants under the burden of integration costs. This paper models the strategic interactions between an incumbent and an entrant, taking into account the integration cost incurred by the entrant and the associated estimation bias exhibited by the incumbent. In the baseline setting with an unbiased incumbent, we find that the entrant’s higher integrative capability (i.e., lower integration cost) always hurts the incumbent, and can even hurt the entrant itself. We then investigate how the incumbent’s estimation bias affects firm performance, and find that increasing the bias can actually benefit the entrant and, intriguingly, the incumbent as well. In particular, a mutually beneficial situation can emerge where a higher level of bias potentially improves profits for both the incumbent and the entrant. Additionally, we extend our analysis to settings with random integration costs, where the bias can be linked to either the mean or the variance of these costs. Our findings offer practical implications for entrants in choosing their integrative capability strategy, and for incumbents in deciding whether to pursue bias reduction.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Incentives for Information Revelation in a Supply Chain and the Bullwhip Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Getting downstream firms in a supply chain to share private information about consumer demand with their suppliers is generally considered a prerequisite to dampening the bullwhip effect, i.e., the amplification of demand shocks as they pass upstream in a supply chain. If downstream firms are reluctant to share their demand information, how can they best be incentivized to do so, and what does the optimal incentive scheme imply for the bullwhip effect and supply chain efficiency? We examine these questions by developing a supply chain model with asymmetric information, and show that the supplier should optimally follow a two-pronged strategy. One prong consists of the optimal incentive contract to induce information revelation. Information revelation requires a distortion in the downstream firm’s orders that makes them more responsive to demand shocks, which tends to strengthen the bullwhip effect. The other prong helps to reduce this distortion and dampen the bullwhip effect. It consists of getting the downstream firm to increase its initial order and stock up on inventory before it learns about demand. A larger initial order is sufficient to eliminate the bullwhip effect if demand shocks are not too persistent. Our results hold if the marginal production cost does not increase too quickly with output and the inventory holding cost is not too high.</content>

    <title>Creating Radical Technologies and Competencies: Revisiting Interorganizational Dynamics in the Nascent Bionic Prosthetic Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why were incumbents able to pioneer and dominate the nascent bionic prosthetic industry, even though entrants represented the majority of the firms investing in this radical technology? To answer this question, our abductive study builds on the novel base principles definition and uses a historical approach to investigate the incubation and early commercialization periods (1974–2018) of bionic prosthetics. We use comprehensive quantitative data on all technological entrants and historical analysis of significant firms to reveal that organizational prehistory affects both the knowledge and intent of technological entrants. Start-ups, incumbents in conventional prosthetics, and established firms in other industries created and integrated subtechnologies into a radical system. Although all firms invested in component technologies, incumbents played a key role as system integrators. Incumbents dominated product commercialization; start-ups captured value through alliances or by being acquired, and established firms in other industries leveraged their knowledge in adjacent value chains as a function of their prior histories and intents. In comparing the virtues of our explanation—the creating radical systems effects—with widely accepted alternative explanations, we develop a more generalized framework of interorganizational dynamics in nascent industries as an endogenous, coevolutionary process that goes beyond explanations that privilege competitive dynamics to also include collaborative dynamics in value creation (and capture).Funding: This paper was funded by the Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets at the University of Maryland, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Strategic Research Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16915 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how market uncertainty impacts the liquidity premium through a demand-side channel. I find that equity mutual funds actively increase the liquidity of their portfolios in response to increased redemptions during market stress. Liquidity preservation is more intense for funds more exposed to strategic complementarities. I show that a stock’s relative illiquidity within a fund’s portfolio is a key determinant in flow-induced rebalancing decisions, whereby funds follow a liquidation “pecking order.” This “flight-to-liquidity” is associated with increases in the liquidity premium and affects individual stocks’ reversal performance: Stocks held by more fragile funds and those with higher illiquidity ranks within funds’ portfolios experience greater returns to liquidity provision during market stress.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02095 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private firms often develop new products by utilizing substantial infrastructure investments made by government agencies. We construct a mixed oligopoly model to study the interactions between the government’s infrastructure quality decision and the subsequent public and private product development decisions. We have five main results: First, the government permits firm entry in the product market only when the firm is sufficiently more efficient at product development than the government. With firm entry, the government invests more in developing infrastructure because the firm’s presence increases the government’s return on investment in infrastructure. Second, the quality received by the consumer might improve or worsen in the presence of a private firm, depending on the relative product development efficiency as well as the cost of infrastructure development. Third, private presence can lead to a significant reduction in consumer surplus, especially at the lower end of the market. This happens when infrastructure investment cost is high, because the small increase in infrastructure quality with firm entry is not enough to compensate for the reduction in the government’s product quality. Fourth, depending on the relative product development efficiency of the private firm, the government might implement policies that prevent the private firm from entering the market. Finally, there exist circumstances under which private presence can be beneficial in that it leads to products that not only enhance social welfare but also improve overall consumer surplus.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: S.

    <title>Using Social Recognition to Address the Gender Difference in Volunteering for Low-Promotability Tasks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows that women volunteer significantly more for tasks that people prefer others to complete. Such tasks carry little monetary incentives because of their very nature. We use a modified version of the volunteer’s dilemma game to examine if nonmonetary interventions, particularly social recognition, can be used to reduce the gender gap associated with such tasks. We conduct a laboratory experiment with three treatments where (a) a volunteer receives positive social recognition, (b) a nonvolunteer receives negative social recognition, and (c) a volunteer receives positive social recognition but a nonvolunteer receives negative social recognition. Our results indicate that social recognition increases the overall probability that an individual volunteers. Positive social recognition reduces the gender gap observed in the baseline treatment, and so does the combination of positive and negative social recognition. These findings suggest that public recognition of volunteering for such tasks can change the default gender norms in organizations and increase efficiency simultaneously.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was primarily funded by the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore [Seed Grant 7399FW].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04017 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically impacted human decision‐making, productivity, and human agentic role delivery, thereby transforming HRM practices, particularly in recruitment and selection. Traditional recruitment and selection methods involve the dynamic interplay of structure and human agents. This interplay is changing with the emergence of human‐technology‐conjoined agencies that share task delivery and role performance responsibilities, thereby altering and creating new recruitment and selection routines. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 43 HR and talent acquisition leaders in a high‐growth emerging market context to understand the transformational role of discriminative and generative AI technology agencies in changing recruitment and selection practices. This study contributes to existing HRM literature by demonstrating the impact of discriminative and generative AI in recruitment and selection and the simultaneous human‐AI collaboration and algorithmic management of humans emerging as a consequence. Furthermore, we theorize the transformational changes in structures and processes across the entire recruitment and selection process emerging from conjoined agencies.</content>

    <title>Ecosystem synergies as drivers of acquisitions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the structure of ecosystems shapes firms’ acquisition choices. We develop a theoretical framework comprising three levels of ecosystem structure – local interdependence, clusters, and centrality – that could drive choices of M&amp;A targets based on expected ecosystem synergies, a previously undocumented acquisition synergy that creates benefits for the acquirer and the ecosystem overall. Ecosystem synergy is value created through combination of the acquirer and target's ecosystem positions that improves the combined firm's alignment with third‐party complementors. Such synergies manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of the firms’ components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. In the setting of the e‐commerce technology industry, our results show that firms acquire targets to increase local interdependence of their components and their presence in component clusters.Managerial SummaryInnovation ecosystems are critical for firms’ performance. While prior research has established the importance of ecosystems and firms’ positioning within ecosystems, we do not actually know whether and how ecosystem structure shapes firms’ acquisition choices. In this article, we show that M&amp;A targets are not chosen solely for the value created by the acquirer or target, but also for their broader ecosystem synergies. Ecosystem synergies are a previously undocumented acquisition synergy (distinct from internal synergies and market power) that manifest themselves in increased attractiveness of firms’ post‐acquisition components to third parties by strengthening, attracting, or connecting complementarities. We test our theory by mapping the ecosystem structure of 6187 technological components that drives 186 acquisitions in the e‐commerce technology sector during the period 2013 to 2021.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important class of structural models studies the determinants of skill formation and the optimal timing of interventions. In this paper, I provide new identification results for these models and investigate the effects of seemingly innocuous scale and location restrictions on parameters of interest. To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without these additional restrictions and show that important policy-relevant parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact the interpretation of parameters and may affect counterfactuals. Importantly, with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions fix identified parameters and lead to misspecification. Consequently, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables might yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I show how existing estimators can easily be adapted to solve these issues. As a byproduct, this paper also presents a general and formal definition of when restrictions are truly normalizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many online platforms like ride-sharing or grocery delivery, some demand agents can wait for a short period of time for a service if they are assured of its eventual provision within an acceptable delay. We study these “partially patient” agents in the context of an online resource allocation problem, contrasting them with impatient agents who require immediate service. We utilize a relaxed notion of competitive ratio, known as the resource/feature augmented competitive ratio, allowing online algorithms to benefit from additional features not available to the optimal offline algorithm. We introduce a class of polytope-based resource allocation (POLYRA) algorithms that achieve optimal or near-optimal competitive ratios by consulting specific polytopes and maintaining feasible algorithm states within these polytopes. For two or three types of agents, these algorithms can achieve the optimal competitive ratio. For more than three types, we present a near-optimal nested POLYRA algorithm that secures at least 80% of the optimal ratio. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical analysis, highlighting the efficiency of our algorithms beyond adversarial arrivals and the modified competitive ratio framework.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03335 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Enterprise risk management (ERM) is an institutional agenda emphasizing holistic risk oversight and strategic planning. This study examines whether and how the adoption of ERM affects management earnings forecasts. We first document that ERM adoption increases the likelihood and accuracy of management earnings forecasts. We then provide evidence that ERM adoption improves forecast quality by reducing the volatility of fundamentals and enhancing managers’ ability to assess both internal and external information. Finally, we find that the positive effect of ERM in improving forecast accuracy is more pronounced for long-horizon forecasts, consistent with ERM’s long-term strategic focus. Collectively, our results shed light on how ERM adoption improves the quality of a key voluntary disclosure—management forecasts.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <title>Displaying and Discounting Perishables: Impact on Retail Profits and Waste</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical studies have shown that consumers’ purchasing behavior depends on product display, that is, how products are organized on store shelves. We explore how a retailer selling a perishable product with deteriorating quality over time can optimize product display and the discounting of soon-to-expire units to maximize profit and reduce waste. Specifically, we consider a product with a finite shelf life that is replenished periodically. The retailer optimizes the product display setting, the discount rate and timing, as well as the order quantity in each replenishment cycle. We assume that the length of the replenishment cycle is such that, at most, two different product ages can coexist on the store shelves, and we refer to these two groups of products as the fresh batch and the old batch. We show that, when the store traffic is deterministic, only the following two policies can be optimal: (i) discarding unsold units at each replenishment epoch, so that there is only one product batch on the shelves at all times, or (ii) keeping and discounting unsold old batch units but making the fresh batch units more accessible to consumers. In contrast, when the store traffic is stochastic, all possible strategies can be optimal, as waste becomes unavoidable. In particular, the optimal strategy depends on the characteristics of the product, store, and consumers. Our numerical results indicate that, compared with a benchmark where units from the fresh and old batch are equally accessible and no discount is offered, optimizing the display and the discount results in an average increase in profit of 6.01% and a decrease in (relative) waste of 21.24%.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00316 .</content>

    <title>Does the Locker Alliance Network Improve Last Mile Delivery Efficiency?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Locker Alliance Network (LAN), a cutting-edge initiative under Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, aims to revolutionize parcel pickup processes. This government-led project seeks to implement two major changes in Singapore’s urban logistics: (i) establishing an open-access facility for all logistic service providers (LSPs) and (ii) enhancing the last mile delivery efficiency of each LSP, thereby reducing its operational footprint. This research investigates the impact of locker network design on the delivery efficiency of individual LSPs and explores strategies for the government to construct an inclusive network for all LSPs. Our study explores two operational modes: the two-trip mode, in which home and locker deliveries are managed separately, and the mixed-trip mode, which consolidates both into one route. We extend the Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley theorem to estimate the delivery trip length to remaining home locations, assuming consumers can choose between locker pickup or home delivery. This enables us to explicitly formulate the LAN design problem as a nonlinear optimization model. Furthermore, our models for both operational modes reveal that optimal locker network design tends to expand in a nested manner relative to the market share of an LSP. This finding suggests that governments could design locker networks based on the profiles of the largest LSP, ensuring that the expansion of these networks aligns with the existing logistics infrastructure. Leveraging data from LAN’s pilot program in Singapore, our research underscores the pivotal role of network design in last mile delivery efficiency. A poorly designed locker network can inadvertently reduce productivity by increasing the length of delivery trips, thus negating the potential benefits of the system. In contrast, an optimized network can mitigate this negative impact on delivery efficiency. Beyond network design, low customer adoption emerges as another critical bottleneck. Our findings show that, as more customers shift to locker pickup, especially in mixed-trip modes, delivery efficiency improves. Therefore, network design and a higher adoption rate of locker pickup are key to LAN’s success. The government’s role in driving deeper customer engagement, alongside efforts to optimize network design and delivery operations, is vital to unlocking the full potential of this smart nation initiative.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72422006], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16210720, 16500423], the 2019 Academic Research Fund Tier 3, the Ministry of Education, Singapore [Award MOE-2019-T3-1-010], and the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China [Grant CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX1667].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04567 .</content>

    <title>How Hybrid Work Shapes Communication Ties: The Role of Concern about Relationship Loss and Organizational Identification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid shift to hybrid work settings has raised concerns about decreased workplace interactions and communication ties. Based on Need‐to‐Belong Theory, this study extends previous research by adopting the concept of ‘concern about relationship loss’ to explore when and how hybrid work leads to the retention of work‐related communication ties. Our research, comprising a quasi‐experimental study and a pre‐registered replication, both conducted in the US, shows that hybrid work increases worries about the potential loss of work‐related relationships (‘concern about relationship loss’). This concern prompts employees to engage in proactive interpersonal and organizational citizenship behaviours (OCBs), but only when organizational identification is high. Notably, the impact of hybrid work and organizational identification is more pronounced for retaining existing communication ties than for losing or forming new ones. Our findings underscore the need to differentiate between concerns about relationship loss and actual isolation. They also emphasize the active role of employees in maintaining communication ties, highlighting the importance of organizational identification and OCBs. This study extends the conventional view of hybrid workers as passive towards a more dynamic understanding of how employees navigate work‐related communication challenges in hybrid work settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize optimal mutual fund risk-taking strategies in competitive multi-period tournaments among multiple players. With multiple competitors, every player begins by taking maximum risk. In the final period, all players continue to take maximum risk except the leading player, who employs a “lock-in” strategy that depends on the magnitude of the lead. Our theory predicts the leader should strategically lock in advantage by reducing risk-taking if and only if the lead is great enough, rather than an increase in risk-taking by the trailers to try to catch up. Empirical evidence from style-adjusted mutual fund tournaments provides strong and robust support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing use of algorithmic management (AM) in human resource (HR) activities has attracted growing attention from HR scholars, as organizations increasingly rely on digital labor platforms to leverage external workers. This study examines how these platforms apply AM in human resource management (HRM) and how these algorithmic systems embed both market and hierarchy management principles for shaping worker control and autonomy. Specifically, we seek to examine how AM manifests in two distinct ways across these platforms: one involving hierarchy and control, and another involving matching and autonomy. Using an inductive qualitative design, we analyzed 33 semi‐structured interviews with platform workers and documentary data from 23 digital labor platforms. Whereas prior research often frames AM in binary terms—that is, market/autonomy versus hierarchy/control—we explore how task characteristics influence the joint application of both market and hierarchy principles in AM for HRM activities of digital labor platforms. Our findings show how platforms dynamically calibrate market and hierarchy approaches to AM in response to task demands, balancing flexibility, oversight, discretion, and incentives. For HR scholars, this study highlights the flexible and conditional nature of AM systems that blend autonomy and control in nuanced ways. By moving beyond the dominant autonomy‐versus‐control dichotomy, we show how AM is configured to align with diverse forms of work across platforms, enhancing efficiency while sustaining worker engagement amid evolving task demands.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how a domestic venture capital (VC) firm’s syndication experience with reputable foreign VC firms improves its likelihood of achieving successful exits for entrepreneurial firms that it subsequently funds. We identify two complementary theoretical mechanisms: (a) domestic VC firms can gain certification from reputable foreign VC firms that improves access to superior investment opportunities and (b) they can learn from reputable foreign VC firms to better select and nurture ventures. Furthermore, the positive impact of syndication experience is particularly pronounced in facilitating exits for portfolio companies in foreign countries. Our findings highlight the enduring benefits that domestic VC firms gain from partnerships with reputable foreign VC firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users are recognized as a vital source of innovation and entrepreneurship, transitioning from passive consumers to active creators. This shift has significantly impacted the entrepreneurial landscape, prompting multidisciplinary research. Using bibliometric and thematic coding, our study critically analyzes 179 articles published over a 25-year period. Our review presents a theoretical analysis and an integrative conceptual framework comprising eight inductively generated topics nested within three clusters, representing distinctive motivations, processes, and outcomes of user entrepreneurship. Our study also maps the theoretical foundations that have shaped the field, highlighting both dominant perspectives and opportunities for further theoretical development. By clarifying the distinctiveness of user entrepreneurship, our review advances theoretical understanding and provides a structured agenda for future knowledge accumulation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Election results act as powerful signals, shaping social behavior in ways that can be dramatic and even violent. This paper shows how racial violence in the post-Reconstruction U.S. South was tied to the local performance of the anti-Black Democratic Party in presidential elections. Using a regression discontinuity design based on close presidential vote shares, we find that Southern counties where Democrats lost the popular vote between 1880 and 1900 were nearly twice as likely to experience Black lynchings in the following four years. Despite no corresponding changes in local officeholding, these defeats were salient among local elites. We show that Southern newspapers, closely aligned with the Democratic Party, amplified narratives of Black criminality in the aftermath of Democratic losses. Such accusations were, in turn, frequently invoked by lynch mobs. These findings point to the strategic use of racial violence by Democratic elites, foreshadowing the institutionalized vote suppression of Jim Crow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a two-tier supply chain in which multiple manufacturers sell their products through a single retailer, and consumer choices follow a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. Each manufacturer selects from its portfolio an assortment of products to sell, subject to a cardinality constraint on the size of the assortment.We consider both the case where manufacturers take wholesale prices as given and the case where they set their own wholesale prices. The retailer determines the retail prices of the products chosen.We develop efficient methods for computing profit-maximizing assortment and pricing strategies for manufacturers in a competitive environment. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms can reduce computational complexity by orders of magnitude in identifying pure strategy Nash equilibria, which we prove always exist. We also conduct a numerical case study to compare different wholesale pricing regimes, and find that the retailer may favor a cost-plus pricing with a uniform markup percentage, not because the rule induces assortment outcomes that maximize the total profit of the supply chain, but because it grants the retailer a larger share of that profit.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Algorithmic Targeting for Opaque Selling in Vertical Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by algorithmic targeting and data management, we explore a scenario where the seller holds an advantage over consumers regarding match-related information about products. The seller optimizes a product line consisting of two vertically differentiated products alongside an opaque product resulting from their mixture, strategically recommending these products to potential consumers. We model algorithmic targeting using an information design framework, and our investigation revolves around understanding how algorithmic targeting shapes consumer purchasing behaviors and influences market equilibrium. Furthermore, we explore the potential orchestration between algorithmic targeting and opaque selling, facilitated by product-line design. These two closely related instruments coincide in ex-ante manipulating information while differing in their targeting objects. Interestingly, only when the basic products exhibit intermediate differentiation does the seller use both instruments. This is because, when the disparity between the two primary products is extreme (either too large or too small), algorithmic targeting makes opaque selling ineffective at increasing profits. However, when these differences are moderate, the two strategies can complement each other. Opaque selling enhances profitability by introducing intermediate product variety, enabling more nuanced market segmentation, while algorithmic targeting is more flexible in promoting the willingness-to-pay of a wider range of consumers. Furthermore, when conducting welfare analysis, the adoption of algorithmic targeting is found sometimes to reduce consumer surplus but can enhance overall social welfare, highlighting the need for careful regulatory oversight in this domain.</content>

    <title>Unearthing Financial Statement Fraud: Insights from News Coverage Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a financial statement (FS) fraud detection framework, called PeerMeta, that makes improvements in all three components of the detection procedure: label measurement, feature set, and detection model. For the label measurement, prior studies mainly adopt FS fraud events that have already been disclosed and confirmed. We construct a new measure based on news coverage that can reflect unrevealed FS fraud behaviors as well. For the feature set, we innovatively add peer factors learned through the business description texts in financial reports. For the detection model, two meta-learning algorithms are applied to aggregate the 19 popular classifiers. The results indicate that the proposed method has amazingly high recall of real fraud cases announced by regulatory authorities, reaching a staggering value of 0.982. We document that all components in PeerMeta contribute to the improvements of FS fraud detection and also showcase the significant economic value of the detection framework and find that recall is more crucial for the economic value than precision.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71991470, 7199471, 72121002, 72310107002] and the National Key R&amp;D Program of China [Grant 2021YFC3340703].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03604 .</content>

    <title>Open at the Core: Moving from Proprietary Technology to Building a Product on Open Source Software</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly moving away from proprietary technology to building commercial products on top of open source software. However, it is unclear how such commercialization of open source affects contributions from the community, as well as product quality and firm performance. Web browser technology provides a unique setting to study such questions. The largest open source project is Chromium, led by Google, which serves as the core of various web browsers. Unexpectedly, Microsoft announced a drastic change in strategy in 2018 and adopted Chromium in a complete redesign of the web browser Edge. Unique data lets us compare Chromium to other open source technologies, and Chromium-based web browsers to other web browsers. We find that overall development activity increases after Microsoft adopts Chromium, predominantly because Microsoft starts to contribute to the project. We also see a modest increase in contributions from external developers. We further document an increase in scrutiny, evident from an increase in the number of individuals performing code reviews and a surge in security vulnerability reporting. We also find positive effects for Microsoft. Edge makes a giant leap in functionality, moving it on par with the market leader Chrome. With the adoption of Chromium, Microsoft fixes more bugs, accelerates release cycles, and increases the market share of Edge at the expense of other less popular Chromium browsers. We discuss a number of general implications for managers and policy.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Customization and the Customer Journey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently offer customers the opportunity to customize in addition to buying ready-made products. Although prior research shows that customization can increase product evaluations, purchase intent, and willingness to pay, customers often do not opt into customization. Using a multi-method approach, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that the Customization Journey is dynamic rather than static: an initial customization experience has a lasting impact on the customer journey. Nine years of transaction data from a retailer shows that customers who customize at least one product are more likely to customize again with the retailer; they also spend more, visit more often, and buy more items. Next, we conduct a series of longitudinal experimental studies. By randomly assigning some participants to customize and others to choose among a matched set of products, we disentangle the effects of the customer’s inherent preference for customizing from their experience with customization. We find that an initial experience with customization significantly increases the subsequent likelihood of customization, leading to more favorable outcomes for both the customer and the retailer. Our findings suggest that customizers need not be “born”—they can be “created” via interventions designed to increase experience with customization, shaping the trajectories of customer journeys.</content>

    <title>Star Advantage: Employee Value Creation and Capture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into knowledge work is fundamentally reshaping employee performance and value creation in ways that challenge conventional wisdom. Rather than performance disparities being reduced through AI adoption, we argue that they may increase as star employees leverage superior domain expertise and strategic AI deployment to widen performance gaps—a phenomenon we term the “AI‐specific Matthew Effect.” These performance transformations coincide with dramatic shifts in value appropriation dynamics: Personal AI tools will enhance employee bargaining power by enabling portable, high‐value outputs independent of organizational resources, whereas enterprise AI systems serve as novel isolating mechanisms that strengthen firm value capture. These developments necessitate a theoretical reconceptualization of strategic human capital frameworks. Accordingly, we introduce the AI‐specific Matthew Effect to explain how AI may intensify performance stratification, modeling how AI reconfigures value creation and capture between employees and firms, and extending foundational human capital theories to account for human–AI complementarity. Our integrative theoretical framework offers critical guidance for navigating this transformation, helping organizations balance productivity gains with workforce equity in an uncertain era of interdependent human and artificial intelligence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thriving at work is a psychological state defined by dual experiences of vitality and learning. Existing research suggests that HRM practices can play a pivotal role in fostering employee thriving. In this perspective paper, we review the current literature on the relationship between HRM practices and employee thriving through five broad conceptual frameworks: (1) high‐performance HRM systems, (2) development‐oriented HRM, (3) purposeful and responsible HRM, (4) relational and inclusive HRM, and (5) multilevel contextual HRM. Beyond this review, we propose four key avenues for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of how HRM practices contribute to employee thriving. These research directions seek to explore the underlying mechanisms, contexts, and conditions that influence the effectiveness of HRM practices in promoting thriving, with a particular focus on sustaining employee thriving over time. Through these insights, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how HRM can be strategically designed and implemented to support sustainable and regenerative thriving in dynamic work environments.</content>

    <title>The extent and drivers of internal agglomeration of U.S. multi‐unit firms</title>
    <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the extent and determinants of internal agglomeration—the spatial clustering of establishments within firms. It introduces a novel methodology that benchmarks a firm's spatial footprint against that of comparable stand‐alone firms, yielding a firm‐level measure of internal agglomeration. Applied across sectors of the U.S. economy, the approach reveals that internal agglomeration is widespread but varies by industry and firm characteristics. It is more prevalent in service, non‐tradable, and labor‐intensive industries, and is especially pronounced among diversified firms. Among potential drivers, labor similarity consistently predicts intra‐firm colocation, while input–output and knowledge linkages are less influential. These findings bring a spatial lens to corporate strategy, showing that when key resources—particularly labor—face geographic frictions, colocating related activities enhances opportunities for sharing and redeployment.Managerial SummaryMany firms are known to colocate or cluster with other firms in related industries to reap the benefits of sharing specialized inputs, labor, and knowledge. We study whether multi‐unit firms can generate similar benefits by colocating their establishments. We examine the geographic distribution of establishments of multi‐unit firms using comprehensive data on the U.S. economy. We find that over half of all firms colocate their establishments significantly more than would be expected if these belonged to independent firms. Firms are especially likely to colocate establishments with similar labor requirements, which suggests a deliberate strategy to leverage internal labor synergies. Our findings suggest that managers should consider the potential benefits of internal resource sharing when selecting locations, particularly to capitalize on synergies from resources that are less geographically mobile.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do banks fail? We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1863 through 2024 to study the history of failing banks in the United States. Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. These commonalities imply that bank failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Failures with runs were common before deposit insurance, but these failures are strongly related to weak fundamentals, casting doubt on the importance of non-fundamental runs. Furthermore, low recovery rates on failed banks’ assets suggest that most failed banks subject to runs were fundamentally insolvent, barring large value destruction of receiverships. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the primary cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals.</content>

    <title>How Does Prepopulating Search Bars with Keywords Affect Online Consumer Behavior? A Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Search aid technologies, especially prepopulated search bars, are increasingly being adopted by major players in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of prepopulating search bars with keywords on online consumer journey. In this study, I design and run a randomized field experiment on a large e-commerce platform involving 72,587 consumers who were randomly exposed to three types of keywords prefilled in the search bar. Individual consumer–level analyses reveal that prepopulating trending category keywords encourages users to discover and buy items from the suggested category without reducing queries using self-entered keywords, ultimately leading to a 10.4% (8.8%) increase in purchase incidence (spending) compared with the counterfactual outcomes when the search bar is empty. Prepopulating personalized keywords brings about more focused product searching within the category recently browsed by users, resulting in a 21% (17%) increase in purchase incidence (spending), although this is offset by the negative effect of a reduction in queries using self-entered keywords. Exposure to niche category keywords is found to have little impact. This study also finds that a prepopulated search bar does not cannibalize the other navigation tool, making it a beneficial addition to the focal e-commerce platform’s business outcomes. These findings, contributing to the literature on consumer search and product recommendation strategies for digital platforms, carry timely implications for e-commerce managers.History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0793 .</content>

    <title>Social Audience Size as a Reference Point: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the dynamic landscape of the digital economy, social trading platforms are experiencing rapid growth. Our study delves into the impact of changes in social audience size—measured by the number of followers—on traders’ performance and behaviors. Utilizing data from a company-led randomized field experiment conducted on a prominent cryptocurrency social trading platform, we unearth intriguing findings. Traders garnering increased social audience size exhibit tendencies to trade more frequently, utilize higher leverage, and, surprisingly, attain poorer performance. Notably, these adverse effects intensify among traders who previously excelled, suggesting a link to overconfidence. Interestingly, our research uncovers a reference point effect associated with social audience size. Removing accumulated social audience size does not alleviate the negative consequences, instead, they persist. Additionally, we observe an extra adverse effect when traders experience a reduction in the digit magnitude of follower counts, supporting our hypothesis about social audience size serving as a reference point. Our study carries significant implications for the design of social trading platforms. It serves as a crucial reminder for both traders and platform managers to carefully navigate the interplay between social audience size dynamics and trading decisions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Does Personalized Pricing Increase Competition? Evidence from NIL in College Football</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact of personalized pricing through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights within college athletics on the recruitment of high school football players by college programs. We focus on whether the new policy disrupts competitive balance by increasing the concentration of talent among top-ranked institutions. Using a data set that encompasses pre- and post-NIL recruitment patterns to examine the distribution of 3, 4, and 5* recruits at college football programs, we find a notable increase in the dispersion of talent. Contrary to the hypothesis that NIL would lead to a “rich get richer” dynamic, we observe a tendency for lower-ranked football programs to attract higher-quality recruits post-NIL, especially among 5- and lower ranked 4* athletes. Furthermore, we show that post-NIL 3* recruits are sacrificing schooling for NIL money and are attending colleges that are less selective and have lower SAT class averages and whose graduates earn a lower midcareer income. We also do not find evidence that schools that spend more money on football are attracting better talent post-NIL. Competitiveness improves post-NIL as sportsbooks set smaller point differentials even after controlling for talent, performance, and the transfer portal. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive examination of NIL’s short-term effects on competitive balance and sets the stage for ongoing research into the long-term consequences of this landmark policy change.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06423 .</content>

    <title>Product Ratings and Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we investigate how information about production externalities, such as ecolabels, can be presented to create market pressure on firms to reduce these externalities. Specifically, we explore whether integrating information on externalities with consumer product ratings into a single combined rating can generate pressure to reduce externalities from all consumers, not just environmentally conscious ones. Theoretically, we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium where producers invest in both high product quality and low production externalities. We show that under separate ratings, this equilibrium depends on a high proportion of “green” consumers, whereas a combined rating achieves similar results without such a requirement. More broadly, our model suggests that bundling ratings can compel producers to address niche concerns more effectively. We experimentally validate this prediction across two studies, confirming that bundling ratings significantly increases producer investment in additional attributes, such as reducing externalities, while maintaining the rating system’s ability to incentivize high product quality.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was financed by BI Norwegian Business School and the University of Bergen.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04684 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding cultural differences in risk perception is critical in an increasingly uncertain world. Here we examine the relationship between the individualism-collectivism continuum and risk perception around the world using a data set from the Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll. The data set contains rich information of a representative sample of 150,000 participants from 142 countries, and investigates risk perception in terms of perceived likelihood and personal experiences for a range of risks in daily life. We observe that participants from countries with a more individualistic culture perceive lower risk after controlling their personal experiences. We observe similar but weaker patterns when we adopt an epidemiological approach to investigate the individualistic cultural influence of first- and second-generation immigrants and use historical kinship tightness to proxy for individualism. Our study sheds light on the importance of culture in shaping risk perception and contributes to understanding global differences in behavioral traits.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was supported by the Social Science Research Council (Singapore) [Grant MOE2022-SSRTG-029].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01612 .</content>

    <title>How Search Engine Impacts Market Structure: Empirical Evidence from a Multivendor Darknet Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the public’s familiarity with search engines, little existing research empirically investigates the impact of such a search-cost-reduction tool on online market structure. Knowledge scarcity of this question can mainly be attributed to the challenge of accessing detailed data from a cross-website search engine. Using data from the online illegal transaction platform, the Darknet markets, we manage to empirically evaluate the influence of a cross-website search engine (i.e., GRAMS) on the market structure at the vendor and product category levels. The results show that, although the search engine’s entry enhances the overall market performance, the benefit is more significant among leading vendors and popular products, contributing to a more concentrated market. Additional analyses provide empirical evidence that the trustworthiness and the scale-up ability of leading vendors can be the underlying mechanisms for the increased market concentration after the introduction of search engines into Darknet markets. Our study not only contributes to the literature on the dynamics of sales distribution in a multiple-vendor e-commerce market but also provides insights into understanding the operating dynamics of the Darknet markets, which can be helpful for law enforcement policymaking.This paper was accepted by D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates sample selection bias in early-stage investment. We use comprehensive administrative data on the universe of new firm starts in Norway, allowing us to compare venture-backed firms with ex ante similar firms that do not receive venture funding. The valuation premium for venture backing is sizeable at firm birth and doubles over the first 5 years, implying a substantial upward bias in venture capital (VC) returns relative to comparable firms. In contrast, the premium for firms receiving multiple rounds of outside equity emerges only after the first year and remains significantly smaller than the VC premium throughout the firm life cycle.</content>

    <title>Digital Development: Reimagining Research Beyond ICT4D</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions: digital in development (institutional use), digital for development (conscious design for outcomes), and development in a digital world (digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and why do producers change the categorization of their offerings? Prior categorization research assumes that producers engage in ongoing efforts to proactively optimize their categorical positioning, but this assumption may not hold for many producers due to their limited attentional capacity. Our theoretical account instead highlights the role of expectation violation cues—salient pieces of information indicating a violation of audience expectations—as triggers that can lead producers to revise their category choice. Our longitudinal study of 84,667 Airbnb hosts' categorization choices finds that negative customer reviews—an important form of expectation violation cue—significantly increase the likelihood of category‐switching, particularly in categories with heterogeneous expectations. Our study suggests that many producers might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.Managerial SummaryHow businesses categorize their products and services influences their commercial success; yet, there exists very limited understanding of when, why, and how businesses revise their category choices. Our study, which tracked the category choices of over 80,000 Airbnb hosts over time, reveals that Airbnb hosts most commonly switch categories after receiving negative customer reviews, particularly when a review indicates that the accommodation did not meet customer expectations and if the previously chosen category lacks a clearly defined set of expected features. When switching categories, hosts tend to choose categories that are relatively similar to their prior choices and that seem to accommodate a wide variety of offerings. These patterns suggest that many businesses might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.</content>

    <title>Competing through category interaction codes: An inhabited view of category strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces category interaction codes—knowledge regarding the expected interactions around entities in a given category—as a critical dimension of category strategy. Through historical analysis of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we demonstrate how these codes shape strategic categorization and competitive dynamics. We show that firms can exploit ambiguous interaction codes to access advantageous decision makers and organizational routines, circumventing entrenched competitors. Further, firms can institutionalize preferred interaction codes through product design, reshaping category prototypes and market dynamics. However, overcommitment to specific interaction codes creates competitive vulnerabilities when market conditions shift. By developing an “inhabited” view of categories that emphasizes socially embedded practices, this study reveals how market categories are enacted through interactions and offers new insights into category‐based competition.Managerial SummaryThis study introducescategory interaction codes—expectations about where, when, how and by whom products are evaluated, used, and purchased within a market. Using the case of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we show that companies can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging and reconfiguringcategory interaction codes. For example, Wang Laboratories sidestepped direct competition with IBM by categorizing its products for engineers and department managers rather than MIS executives, and outperformed IBM in word processing by innovating how actors interact with the new category. For managers, the key insight is that success depends not only on product features but also on how your product fits into the daily decisions, roles, and behaviors that define a category.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the influence of CEO characteristics on M&amp;A decisions has long spurred researchers’ interest, little attention has been devoted to the ramifications of CEO integrity—the adherence to generally accepted norms and standards. We investigate how CEO integrity influences different stages of the M&amp;A decision process. Specifically, we argue that while CEO integrity reduces self‐serving behavior, it may also become a golden cage that constrains CEOs’ latitude of action. Accordingly, we find that CEO integrity decreases the probability of Type I errors (errors of commission) but increases the probability of Type II errors (errors of omission) in M&amp;A decision‐making. We contribute to theory development by putting forward CEO integrity as an important personality construct for upper echelons research to build on and extend further.Managerial SummaryThis paper examines how CEO integrity influences M&amp;A decision‐making, providing key insights for corporate strategy. Analyzing data from S&amp;P 1500 firms (2006‐2021), we find that CEOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in frequent or large‐scale M&amp;As, particularly avoiding cross‐border deals due to higher uncertainty and potential risks. High‐integrity CEOs also tend to pay lower acquisition premiums and take longer to complete deals, reflecting a cautious and thorough approach. While CEO integrity helps protect firms from costly mistakes it may also lead to missed growth opportunities, indicating a trade‐off between stakeholder considerations and strategic risk‐taking. Boards may need to tailor governance frameworks to optimize the balance between the benefits and constraints of CEO integrity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior work on human-algorithmic bias has seen difficulty in empirically identifying the underlying mechanisms of bias because in a typical “one-time” decision-making scenario, different mechanisms generate the same patterns of observable decisions. In this study, leveraging a unique repeat decision-making setting in a high-stakes microlending context, we aim to uncover the underlying source, evolution dynamics, and associated impacts of bias. We first develop a structural econometric model of the decision dynamics to understand the source and evolution of bias in human evaluators in microloan granting. We find that both preference-based and belief-based biases exist in human decisions and are in favor of female applicants. Our counterfactual simulations show that the elimination of either of the two biases improves the fairness in financial resource allocation as well as the platform profits. The profit improvement mainly stems from the increased approval probability for male borrowers, especially those who would eventually pay back loans. Furthermore, to examine how human biases evolve when being inherited by machine learning (ML) algorithms, we train state-of-the-art ML algorithms for default risk prediction on both real-world data sets with human biases encoded within and counterfactual data sets with human biases partially or fully removed. We find that even fairness-unaware ML algorithms can reduce bias in human decisions. Interestingly, although removing both types of human bias from the training data can further improve ML fairness, the fairness-enhancing effects vary significantly between new and repeat applicants. Based on our findings, we discuss how to reduce decision bias most effectively in a human-ML pipeline.This paper has been accepted by D. J.

    <title>Strategic Behavior by Equity Lenders</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that stock lenders are informed about market conditions and pursue revenue maximization by setting premiums or offering discounts on stock loan fees. Using a model of supply and demand in the equity lending market, we illustrate the effect of stock borrowers’ private information on the elasticity of shorting demand. Strategic lenders respond to demand elasticity and increase their revenues through premiums or discounts on lending fees. Empirically, decomposing stock loan fees into intrinsic fee and premium or discount, we confirm lenders’ strategic behavior, showing that premiums and discounts among difficult-to-borrow stocks lead to increased lending revenues. This strategic lending behavior has new implications about informed shorting, short interest, and transaction costs in the equity lending market.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03270 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mutual funds known as closet indexers are marketed as active but actually operate as low-activity funds. Investors end up paying for full service but receiving only a part of it. Supervisory authorities around the world are considering ways to regulate these funds. In this context, we examine the impact of regulatory interventions by Scandinavian regulators. We compare the scrutinized Scandinavian funds with similar unaffected European funds. The findings suggest that the regulated Scandinavian funds preferred increased activity over fee reduction. Consequently, fund managers adopted more active management strategies, resulting in a significant 2% decrease in annual alpha. Therefore, the regulatory interventions resulted in unfavorable outcomes for investors.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This research was supported by funding from the Varekrigsfond for forsikringsaktiviteter at NHH.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03124 .</content>

    <title>Inheriting Versus Developing Data Analytic Tests and Auditors’ Professional Skepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the use of audit data analytic tests (ADA) becomes increasingly established in practice, auditors will often confront situations in which they inherit ADA developed by others, as opposed to developing the ADA themselves. Despite the potential benefits of ADA, inheriting ADA could decrease auditors’ skeptical actions by diminishing their psychological ownership of the ADA. In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA. Evidence from mediation analyses suggests that these effects are driven by decreased psychological ownership when auditors inherit the ADA.</content>

    <title>Listen Closely: Measuring Vocal Tone in Corporate Disclosures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the usefulness of machine learning approaches for measuring vocal tone in corporate disclosures. We document a substantial mismatch between the widely adopted actor‐based training data underlying these approaches and speech in corporate disclosures. We find that existing models achieve near‐perfect vocal tone classification within their training domain. However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance. Our findings emphasize the importance of a domain‐specific approach to voice analysis in accounting and finance.</content>

    <title>Rethinking Indigenous Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous Entrepreneurship has been conceptualized as arising from and reflecting cultural characteristics common to Indigenous people internationally, yet this approach increasingly fails to capture its diversity. Drawing on a database of 19,530 Indigenous enterprises in Australia, we show that criterial approaches to defining Indigenous Entrepreneurship based on preconceived ideas about Indigenous ways of doing business do not adequately characterize Indigenous entrepreneurial activity. We propose an approach that analyses Indigenous entrepreneurialism as a strategic response to the challenges and opportunities encountered by Indigenous entrepreneurs, shifting the focus of study fromexpressions of indigeneity in entrepreneurship, toentrepreneurial responses to Indigenous contexts.</content>
