    <title>Banning Unsolicited Store Flyers: Does Helping the Environment Hurt Retailing?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a ban on unsolicited store flyers in seven Dutch municipalities that shifted from an opt-out to an opt-in policy between 2018 and 2020. Despite a 50% drop in flyer distribution, household grocery shopping behavior remained largely unchanged. The findings suggest that reducing flyer waste may be possible without substantially disrupting shopping behavior.</content>

    <title>On Greedy-Like Policies in Online Matching with Reusable Network Resources and Decaying Rewards</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T13:44:09+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>David Simchi-Levi, Zeyu Zheng, Feng Zhu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a unified modeling framework for classical online matching problems and emerging online matching problems with three additional practical features: reusable resources, network resources, and decaying rewards. For online matching problems in the unified framework, we provide a unified performance analysis tool for the greedy policy and its simple variants, which we refer to as greedy-like policies. We prove that greedy-like policies can achieve near-optimal performances for online matching problems in the unified framework, where the policy performance is measured by competitive ratios under adversarial environments. We then analyze several representative special classes of online matching problems, which incorporate additional realistic structural assumptions on top of the unified framework. Specifically, we consider online matching problems with each of the following three additional structures: (i) singleton resources with time-decaying rewards; (ii) network resources with accept/reject decisions; and (iii) network resources with interval-type bundles. We show that for these special classes of online matching problems, slight modifications to greedy-like policies can successfully utilize additional structural information to further enhance policy performances. This work may suggest that the greedy policy and its variants, despite its simplicity, can achieve reliable performances for a number of emerging online matching problems.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>How Do Domestic and Foreign Firms Respond to a Reduction in Competition from the Public Sector? Evidence from Vaccine Markets in India</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T13:44:09+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how domestic and foreign firms in the private sector respond to a reduction in competition from the public sector. Our analysis exploits the sudden suspension of production licenses of vaccine-manufacturing public sector units (PSUs) in January 2008 in India, home to more than 1.2 billion people at that time. Although the suspension presented a window of opportunity for private sector firms, the opportunity was laden with high uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we find that the suspension was associated with revenue gains driven by new product introductions and that these gains persist even after the supply suspension revocation in February 2010. Importantly, unlike domestic firms, foreign firms gain little. We explore potential mechanisms and find evidence consistent with one of them being the major reason for the differing impact: Domestic firms better navigate the challenges arising from political pluralism, an institutional feature characterized by a lack of political alignment between national and subnational governments. In the presence of political alignment, domestic firms do not have a comparative advantage over foreign firms. Our evidence thus highlights that even an uncertain and transitory window of opportunity arising from a controversial reduction in competition from the public sector can lead to a fundamental market restructuring in ways that can diverge from the intended policy objective. In particular, domestic firms’ ability to manage political pluralism is a core mechanism explaining their comparative advantage over foreign firms in the wake of a national crisis.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Start-Up Research Grant A-0003843-00-00], the University of Minnesota [Summer Research Grant], and the Indian School of Business [Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06174 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of On-the-Job Experience on Base-Rate Neglect: Evidence from Medical Professionals</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect.This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Lehigh University [FRG Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05461 .</content>

    <title>The Effects of MiFID II on Voluntary Disclosure</title>
    <updated>2025-10-01T13:44:09+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II’s controversial unbundling provision on corporate voluntary disclosure. Although prior research has largely focused on changes in sell-side research post-MiFID II, changes in voluntary disclosure and their effects on the information environment are less known. We find that European Union (EU) firms significantly increased the propensity and frequency of management earnings guidance issuance after MiFID II enactment. This effect is more pronounced among firms experiencing a decline in the quantity of sell-side research or a reduction in the consumption and dissemination of analyst reports and is more muted among firms witnessing improvements in research quality. Furthermore, we find that post-MiFID earnings guidance by EU firms becomes more thorough and elicits stronger market reactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the increased guidance effectively alleviates the negative liquidity effects of MiFID II. Collectively, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the efficacy of MiFID II’s unbundling provision by providing evidence that voluntary disclosure plays a key role in mitigating the unintended net negative consequences on the information environment following the regulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: Financial support from the New York University Stern School of Business, Seoul National University, the Baruch College Zicklin School of Business, and George Washington University is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Can Socially Minded Governance Control the Artificial General Intelligence Beast?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealized conditions that presume that the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI, even if this does not maximize profits. It is demonstrated that a socially minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimize harm from AGI that unrestricted products released by for-profit firms might create. The reason is that a socially minded entity can only minimize the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms at a prohibitive financial cost and so, does not preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine data (MD), that is, data generated by machines, are increasingly gaining importance, potentially surpassing the value of the extensively discussed personal data. We present a theoretical analysis of the MD market, addressing challenges such as data fragmentation, ambiguous property rights, and the public-good nature of MD. We consider machine users producing data and data aggregators providing MD analytics services (e.g., with digital twins for real-time simulation and optimization). By analyzing machine learning algorithms, we identify critical properties for the value of MD analytics, Scale, Scope, and Synergy. We leverage these properties to explore market scenarios, including anonymous and secret contracting, competition among MD producers, and multiple competing aggregators. We identify significant inefficiencies and market failures, highlighting the need for nuanced policy interventions.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00674 .</content>

    <title>Limits of Disclosure Regulation in the Municipal Bond Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effectiveness of recent federal disclosure regulation aiming to improve transparency in the $4 trillion municipal bond market. Governments fail to disclose material private placements 50%–60% of the time and, conditional on disclosure, filings often omit contract details essential for bond pricing. Noncompliant issuers are significantly riskier than compliers, with disclosure decreasing in the potential of privately placed debt to adversely affect bondholders. We show that disclosure reveals positive news and is especially informative to investors in low-rated bonds or during market crises. Overall, privately placed debt continues to pose significant risks to municipal bond investors.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: T.

    <title>Pricing Durable Add-Ons: Selling vs. Leasing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms offer products that consist of a durable base good (e.g., a vehicle) and a durable add-on (e.g., autopilot software). Some lease the add-on, whereas others sell it through intertemporal price discrimination or bundled pricing. Motivated by these practices, we examine whether a monopolistic firm should lease or sell the add-on when offering both durables. The literature suggests that leasing is preferable for a single durable good as it avoids the time inconsistency problem associated with selling. However, because leasing lacks an intertemporal link, it is less efficient than selling in balancing surplus extraction across consumers, leading to what we call the intraperiod imbalance problem. When the firm sells the base good, this can resolve the time inconsistency of add-on selling but perpetuate the intraperiod imbalance of add-on leasing. Thus, selling the add-on can be more profitable than leasing it. When the firm can choose between selling or leasing the base good, selling both the base good and the add-on can be more profitable than leasing both.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the unique institutional feature that the Israeli government bond market operates on an exchange rather than over-the-counter to analyze whether and why having an exchange affects market liquidity during a crisis. We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets, such as the Israeli government bond market, with markets lacking an exchange. Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02344 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newly released music is never assessed in isolation by audiences, who tend to compare objective (sonic attributes) and subjective (genre affiliations) elements of its identity with the previous musical catalog of the corresponding artist, his or her musically proximal peers, and the most successful releases in the market. In this paper, we provide a general framework that disentangles the objective and subjective identities of new musical releases and evaluates how differentiation affects audience reactions. We posit that radio stations, who seek commercial success, have different preferences toward differentiation in comparison with critics, who grant cultural legitimacy in the industry. Combining play numbers, reviews, and music description data from different sources, we find that radio stations prefer consistency in the musical style of successive releases by the focal artist and especially favor albums that sound similar to chart toppers. Critics, however, exhibit opposite preferences, preferring novelty compared with past works of the artist, while remaining uninfluenced by contemporaneous music dynamics. Our moderation checks reveal that decisions around genre affiliations and scheduling of new releases aid music producers to effectively manage audience expectations. This suggests that data-driven decision support systems can help artists to strategically release new products that cater to heterogeneous tastes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03319 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <title>Auditing with a Chance of Whistleblowing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of promoting whistleblowing on audit quality and the efficiency of detecting misstatements. On the one hand, whistleblowing alerts the enforcer to the possibility of a misstatement and intensifies the regulatory effort, thereby incentivizing the auditor to improve audit quality. On the other hand, promoting whistleblowing reduces the enforcer’s investigative effort when there is no whistleblowing allegation, which in turn dampens the auditor’s incentive to enhance audit quality. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, encouraging more whistleblowing can impair audit quality and reduce detection efficiency. We also examine the socially optimal whistleblowing program, and our analysis implies that the optimal whistleblowing intensity is increasing in investment cost and the quality of the whistleblower’s information.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <title>A Preregistered Falsification Test of the Decision by Sampling Model and Rank-Order Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was funded by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation [Grant MAW 2016.0132] and the Swedish Research School of Management and IT.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03611 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit within-firm variations in plant-level toxic releases to examine the effect of managerial hometown preference on corporate environmental policies. We find that pollution levels are about 30% lower for plants located near chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) hometowns. This reduction is achieved through resource-intensive pollution control efforts, including source reduction and waste management activities. Analyses using CEO turnover provide causal inferences. Local residents benefit from CEO hometown pollution reduction as localities hosting more hometown plants experience improved environmental conditions and better residential health outcomes. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that CEOs’ hometown preference is related to agency frictions. Overall, our findings reveal the impact of CEOs’ personal motivations on corporate pollution dynamics and their consequential effects on the well-being of local communities.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Q.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel 15-year data set on surgeon adoption of a complex surgical innovation in the English National Health Service and an identification strategy based on surgeon mobility, this paper disentangles three channels of coworker influence on innovation diffusion: (1) peer network size, (2) influential “key players,” and (3) cumulative peer adoption. We find that a one standard deviation in peer connections boost innovation by 16%. Key players can either amplify or dampen diffusion, and peer adoption has a greater impact on less experienced individuals. These results highlight the value of targeting training to high impact network members to speed up diffusion. This work advances our understanding of how professional networks shape innovation diffusion, with implications for technology implementation.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the European Research Council (ANR-17-EURE-0010, POEMH, Advanced Investigator Award HealthCareLabour REP-SCI-788529), the Australian Research Council (Discovery Project DP220101043) and the Health Foundation (Efficiency Research Programme).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00496 .</content>

    <title>Gender Differences in High-Stakes Performance and College Admission Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Gale-Shapley algorithm is one of the most popular college allocation mechanisms around the world. A crucial policy question in its setting is designing admission priorities for students, understanding how they disadvantage certain demographic groups, and whether these differences relate to differences in college performance potential. Studying a policy change in Spain, we find a negative effect of increasing the weight of standardized high-stakes exams on female college admission grades, driven by students expected to be at the top. The impact on admission grades does not affect enrollment, but the percentage of female students in the most selective degrees declines, along with their career prospects. Using data on the college performance of prereform cohorts, we find that female students most likely to lose from the reform tend to do better in college than male students expected to benefit from the reform. The results show that rewarding high-stakes performance in selection processes may come along with gender differences unrelated to the determinants of subsequent performance.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the demand for online freelancers using a large data set from a leading global freelancing platform. We identify the types of jobs that are more affected by generative AI and quantify the magnitude of the heterogeneous impact. Our findings indicate a 21% decrease in the number of job posts for automation-prone jobs related to writing and coding compared with jobs requiring manual-intensive skills within eight months after the introduction of ChatGPT. We show that the reduction in the number of job posts increases competition among freelancers, whereas the remaining automation-prone jobs are of greater complexity and offer higher pay. We also find that the introduction of image-generating AI technologies led to a 17% decrease in the number of job posts related to image creation. We use Google Trends to show that the more pronounced decline in the demand for freelancers within automation-prone jobs correlates with their higher public awareness of ChatGPT’s substitutability.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05420 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policies geared toward environmental and economic improvement could unexpectedly lead to negative consequences in other dimensions. Such cases raise a red flag to economists and policymakers who aim to deliver comprehensive and sensible policy evaluations. This article investigates antisocial behaviors in response to the Clean Winter Heating Policy (CWHP), which seeks to improve outdoor air quality. Our results show that participating villagers are more likely to violate laws to burn agricultural waste and exhibit lower prosociality in incentivized dictator games and public goods games. We further explore treatment heterogeneities and find that two channels are likely to play a part. First, the CWHP was perceived as a negative income shock. Therefore, the villagers would want to reduce their expenditure on straw disposal and behave less generously in the incentivized games. Second, the CWHP could trigger discontent and directly affect social preference. Additional evidence suggests that the antisocial (less prosocial) responses could have been avoided by granting larger upfront subsidies.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: J.

    <title>Evaluating Mortgage Renegotiation Strategies: A Data-Driven Framework for Investors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper offers a novel framework to quantify the expected gains from renegotiating delinquent loans. The framework accounts for important trade-offs between concessions to borrowers, postdelinquency loan performance, and expected collateral values. The framework’s parameters are calibrated using data on renegotiated 30-year residential fixed-rate mortgages that went delinquent during the Great Recession. Our model-implied expected gains increase during the 2007–2009 period coinciding with an increase in the rate of loan renegotiation. Counterfactual analyses show that larger expected gains can be generated from employing principal forbearance and extensions of the term to maturity compared with principal write-downs and interest-rate reductions. On the other hand, principal write-downs can be a powerful tool when borrowers are deeply underwater. Our analyses illustrate how lenders or policymakers might deploy this framework when faced with another delinquency crisis.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The author thanks the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Investors and Financial Markets at the University of Virginia for funding for this paper.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02672 .</content>

    <title>Do Institutional Investors Stabilize Equity Markets in Crisis Periods? Evidence from COVID-19</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the COVID-19 stock market crash, U.S. stocks with higher institutional ownership (IO) performed worse than those with lower IO. By studying firm-level changes, we identify two mechanisms behind this effect: a sudden downscaling of institutional capital in the equity market and a collective attempt by institutions to reposition their equity portfolios toward more COVID-resilient stocks. The stock price effects of their “portfolio downscaling” trades quickly reversed in the market’s recovery phase, whereas those of their “portfolio repositioning” trades lingered. The institutional rush for firm resilience also caused price pressures, with retail investors providing liquidity to stocks sold by institutional investors, both during the crisis and afterward. Overall, our results indicate that when a tail risk is realized, institutional investors amplify price crashes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S. Glossner and P.

    <title>Combining Ad Targeting Techniques: Evidence from a Field Experiment in the Auto Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retargeted advertising that tries to entice potential customers back to a website is widely used by advertisers and has often replaced more traditional forms of targeting, such as contextual targeting that tries to match ads to website content. However, existing research has not investigated the extent to which these different targeting techniques compete with or complement each other. To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale field experiment with an automobile manufacturer to investigate how retargeting meshes with more traditional techniques of contextual targeting online and in turn how that should affect ad content. We investigate this using three different measures of online advertising effectiveness: website visits, engagement, and soft conversions. We find that combining contextual targeting and retargeting is more effective for all three measures. However, to unleash this effectiveness, marketers have to pay attention to the ad content in their retargeted ads. We find that when combining retargeted advertising with contextual targeting, ads that prompt users to customize an offering are the most effective. Last, we provide empirical evidence for understanding the underlying mechanism associated with our findings and replicate those findings with a laboratory experiment.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02310 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the problem of sharing the revenues raised from subscriptions to music streaming platforms among content providers. We provide direct, axiomatic, and game-theoretical foundations for two focal (and somewhat polar) methods widely used in practice: pro rata and user centric. The former rewards artists proportionally to their number of total streams. With the latter, each user’s subscription fee is proportionally divided among the artists streamed by that user. We also provide foundations for two families of methods addressing the rising concern in the music industry to explore new streaming models that better align the interests of artists, fans, and streaming services. One of the families offers a natural compromise between the pro rata and user-centric methods. The other family generalizes the user-centric method while capturing various formalizations of incentives for artists and users.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Xunta de Galicia [Grant ED431B2022/03] and MCIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and FSE+ [Grants PID2020-113440GBI00, PID2020-115011GB-I00, and PID2023-146364NB-I00].</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the popularity of the phrase “wisdom of the crowd,” not all crowds are wise because not everyone in them acts in an informed, rational manner. Identifying informative actions, therefore, can help to isolate the truly wise part of a crowd. Motivated by this idea, we evaluate the informational value of investors’ bids using data from online, debt-based crowdfunding, in which we were able to track both investment decisions and ultimate repayment statuses for individual loans. We propose several easily scalable variables derived from the heterogeneity of investors’ bids in terms of size and timing. We first show that loans funded with larger bids relative to the typical bid amount in the market or to the bidder’s historical baseline, particularly early in the bidding period, are less likely to default. More importantly, we perform theory-driven feature engineering and find that these variables improve the predictive performance of state-of-the-art models that have been proposed in this context. Even during the fundraising process, these variables improve predictions of both funding likelihood and loan quality. We discuss the implications of these variables, including loan pricing in secondary markets, crowd wisdom in different market mechanisms, and financial inclusion. Crowdfunding platforms can easily implement these variables to improve market efficiency without compromising investor privacy.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Business Analytics Center in the Scheller College of Business and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02575 .</content>

    <title>A Structural Model of a Firm’s Operating Cash Flow with Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective management of a firm’s operating cash flow is essential for supporting growth, servicing debt, and maintaining overall financial health. Mismanagement of cash flows can result in severe liquidity challenges and even business failure. However, managing operating cash flow is complex because of its intricate, endogenous relationships with operational variables, like sales, operating costs, inventory, payables, and the impact of exogenous macroeconomic factors on a firm. In this paper, we present a structural model of operating cash flow that untangles this endogeneity, allows us to estimate causal relationships among these variables, and provides a valuable tool for evaluating cash flow management policies. Applying our model to quarterly financial data from S&amp;P’s Compustat database spanning from 1990 to 2020 along with macroeconomic indicators, we provide empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of cash flow with other operational variables. We then showcase the practical value of our model by (i) identifying the characteristics of structural shocks and the new equilibria they induce within the system; (ii) offering a tool for evaluating alternative managerial actions or policy decisions to counteract these shocks; (iii) predicting the impacts of macroeconomic events, such as global recessions and fluctuations in economic sentiment, on firm performance; and (iv) demonstrating superior forecasting performance compared with traditional univariate models. In summary, our structural model of operating cash flow enhances our understanding of its dynamics, enabling better-informed decision making and more effective cash flow management in firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03790 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is more competition the key to mitigating dominance by large tech platforms? Could regulation of such markets be a better alternative? We study the effects of competition and interoperability regulation in platform markets. To do so, we propose an approach of competition in net fees, which is well-suited to situations in which users pay additional charges, after joining, for on-platform interactions. Compared with existing approaches, the net fee model expands the tractable scope to allow variable total demand, platform asymmetry, and merger analysis. Regarding competition, we find that adding more platforms to the market may lead to the emergence of a dominant firm. In contrast, we find that interoperability can play a key role in reducing market dominance and lowering prices. Broadly speaking, our results favor policy interventions that assure the formidability of the competition that dominant platforms face.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that losses constrain short sellers but not the transmission of information to prices. Using unique data on U.S. equity lending, we document a negative impact of the mark-to-market losses of a stock’s short sellers, but no impact of their gains, on the future shorting of the stock. Consistent with funding and institutional constraints limiting short selling, we further show that the effect is highly asymmetric across different loss levels and stronger among stocks facing higher margin requirements. However, loss-making short selling has no impact on price efficiency or predictive power for returns, suggesting that these constraints affect mostly uninformed shorting activity.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the University of Melbourne [Faculty Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01356 .</content>

    <title>Sampling-Based Approximation for Series Inventory Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study inventory management of an infinite-horizon, series system with multiple stages. Each stage orders from its immediate upstream stage, and the most upstream stage orders from an external supplier. Random demand with unknown distribution occurs at the most downstream stage. Each stage incurs inventory holding cost while the most downstream stage also incurs demand backlogging cost when it experiences inventory shortage. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over the planning horizon. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to obtain a heuristic policy (SAA policy) using the empirical distribution function constructed from a demand sample (of the underlying demand distribution). We derive an upper bound of sample size (viz., distribution-free bound) that guarantees that the performance of the SAA policy be close (i.e., with arbitrarily small relative error) to the optimal policy under known demand distribution with high probability. This result is obtained by first deriving a separable and tight cost upper bound of the whole system that depends on (given) echelon base-stock levels and then showing that the cost difference between the SAA and optimal policies can be measured by the distance between the empirical and the underlying demand distribution functions. We also provide a lower bound of sample size that matches the upper bound (in the order of relative error). Furthermore, when the demand distribution is continuous and has an increasing failure rate (IFR), we derive a tighter sample size upper bound (viz., distribution-dependent bound). Both distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the newsvendor problem, a special case of our series system, improve the previous results. In addition, we show that both bounds increase polynomially as the number of stages increases. The performance of SAA policy and the sample size bounds are illustrated numerically. Finally, we extend the results to finite-horizon series systems.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: K.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a measure of local long-run growth prospects, I uncover a novel link between economic fundamentals and house prices. Whereas excess housing returns are positively associated with economic growth prospects, housing valuations are negatively associated with shocks to growth prospects. I document an explanation in metro-area consumption: housing consumption is asymmetrically exposed to economic prospects in that it expands more quickly when prospects are strong than it contracts when prospects are poor. I explain these findings through the lens of an asset pricing model that focuses on a trade-off between nonseparable committed housing and nonhousing consumption.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: Data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01996 .</content>

    <title>Economics of Social Media Fake Accounts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid the rise of the influencer economy, fake social media accounts have become prevalent on many social media platforms. Yet the problem of fake accounts is still poorly understood, and so is the effectiveness of coping strategies. This research models the ecosystem of fake accounts in an influencer economy and obtains insights on fake account purchasing behaviors, the impact of antifake efforts, and the roles of various contextual factors. We show that as the antifake effort increases, the equilibrium may transition from a “pooling” equilibrium, where a low-quality influencer buys fake accounts to mimic a high-quality one, to a “costly separating” equilibrium, where a high-quality influencer may buy fake accounts to prevent mimicry from a low-quality influencer, and to a “naturally separating” equilibrium where low- and high-quality influencers are separated without buying fake accounts. We find that increasing antifake efforts and increasing social media literacy may sometimes result in more fake accounts. A purely profit-driven platform always prefers a pooling equilibrium with zero antifake effort. As a platform puts more weight on consumer welfare, it may exert a positive effort to induce a separating equilibrium, but the platform’s preferred antifake effort tends to be lower than that of consumers. We also find that the platform sometimes prefers a lower social media literacy and a lower fake account base price, whereas consumers prefer the opposite. In contrast, improving the antifake technology level can benefit both the platform and consumers. Our main insights are applicable to scenarios with more influencer types and repeated interactions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Retention or Acquisition? Behavior-Based Quality Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms frequently extend their brand by introducing products in new categories and offering free samples or demonstrations for customers to learn about the quality of the new products before purchasing. When introducing new products based on customers’ purchase behavior in the former category, firms face two customer segments: their own customers and the competitor’s customers. Firms can practice behavior-based pricing (BBP) by charging different prices in the two segments. Moreover, firms can practice behavior-based quality disclosure (BBD) by disclosing quality information to the two customer segments differently. In this paper, we examine how firms practice BBD in addition to BBP. We find that in contrast to the acquisition-focused BBP, firms perform retention-focused BBD by increasing quality disclosure to their own customers and decreasing it to the competitor’s customers. Unlike BBP, which decreases second-period profit and increases first-period profit, BBD increases second-period profit but decreases first-period profit when the disclosure cost is low. We also show that when firms endogenously choose BBD, the equilibrium is a prisoner’s dilemma when the disclosure cost is low and a win-win outcome when the disclosure cost is high.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72171103] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01081 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the first adaptively priced iterative combinatorial auction design, which gradually extends price expressiveness as the rounds progress. This mechanism achieves both high efficiency and fast convergence across a wide range of valuation domains. We implement our auction design using polynomial prices, show how to detect when the current price structure is insufficient to clear the market, and show how to correctly expand the polynomial structure to guarantee progress. An experimental evaluation confirms that our auction is competitive with bundle-price auctions in domains where these excel, namely multiminded valuations, but also performs well in domains favorable to linear prices, such as valuations with pairwise synergy.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4993 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One may reasonably think that cultural homophily, defined as the tendency to associate with others of similar culture, affects collaboration in multinational teams in general but not in superstar teams of professionals at the top of their industry. The analysis of an exhaustive data set on the passes made by professional European football players in the top five men’s leagues reveals that on the contrary, cultural homophily is persistent, pervasive, and consequential, even in superstar multinational teams of very-high-skill individuals with clear common objectives and aligned incentives who are involved in interactive tasks that are well defined and not particularly culture intensive.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: G.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demand externalities arise when past sales stimulate future demand. They pervade many consumer markets. To penetrate such markets, how should manufacturers contract with retailers? We formulate the problem as a dynamic game, wherein the retailer can privately observe and control evolving market conditions, and consumers can act either myopically or strategically. Our contribution is threefold. (i) We characterize the optimal contract: It resolves a dynamic tradeoff between exploiting demand externalities, screening new information, and optimizing channel efficiency; moreover, it has a simple implementation of quantity discount. (ii) We characterize the dual role of demand externalities. Although demand externalities can improve channel surplus by expanding market size, they can also exacerbate information friction by enhancing the retailer’s ability to manipulate the market. Ignoring the dark side of the agency cost, previous studies may have overestimated the benefit of demand externalities. (iii) We provide new practical guidance. We show private information per se need not hurt channel efficiency: The manufacturer can use recursive advance selling to extract new information for free. Our results also shed light on when and why manufacturers should moderate demand externalities and prefer long-term contracts. By highlighting the dual role of demand externalities in long-run channel performance, this study sharpens our understanding of channel theory and practice.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: L.

    <title>To Ask or Not to Ask: The Effects of Broadly and Narrowly Adopted Peer-Recognition Systems on Help Seeking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many companies now use peer-recognition systems that allow employees to publicly recognize their peers for positive behaviors. Practitioners have touted the potential for these systems to increase helping among employees. However, the extent to which employees actually use these systems to recognize their peers varies across organizations; some are used broadly by many employees across all functional, specialty, geographic, and hierarchical subgroups of the organization, whereas others are only narrowly used by some, but not all, subgroups. Across three experiments, we examine how peer-recognition systems impact employees’ propensity to ask others for help (i.e., help seeking) based on whether the system is broadly used by all subgroups or only narrowly used by specific subgroups. We predict and find that a peer-recognition system broadly used by all subgroups strengthens employees’ perception of a help-seeking norm. This perception increases employees’ propensity to seek help directly through norm conformity and indirectly by reducing the perceived psychological costs of help seeking. We also predict and find that the effect of peer-recognition systems that are narrowly used by specific subgroups is moderated by whether employees belong to the subgroups using the system; whereas it increases help-seeking propensity for members of the subgroups using the system, it decreases help-seeking propensity for nonmembers relative to when there is no peer-recognition system. Our theory and results suggest that peer-recognition systems can increase help seeking, but these same systems could decrease help seeking for employees belonging to subgroups that do not use the system.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Supported by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00318 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People are often unaware that their personal data can serve as valuable inputs for economic activities in secondary data markets. However, whether secondary monetization of personal data determines privacy preferences remains unclear. I examine whether privacy decisions are motivated by the data recipient’s ability to benefit from trading individuals’ data with a third party. A large online laboratory experiment involving personally identifiable psychometric data is implemented with real data-sharing consequences and monetary benefits. I find that individuals decrease their willingness to share data—both in terms of their likelihood of participating in the data market and the prices demanded for such participation—when the recipient’s ability to monetize the data through secondary trade is salient. Strategic responses to updated beliefs about the recipient’s gain from the trade are ruled out via the chosen price elicitation. I find that increased data exposure (to more recipients) does not explain the significant revealed disutility from secondary monetization. These findings are also robust to controlling for the risk exposure differences between data recipients and third parties.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This project was funded in part by the Institute for the Social Sciences, Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03423 .</content>

    <title>Designing Information to Engage Customers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collaborative customization is common in many markets. Sellers and customers can collectively discover the value of the product’s basic design. Customers’ willingness to pay can also be increased by being engaged to improve the product design. We study how a seller can design the information structure of collective learning about the product’s basic value to induce costly customer engagement. We consider a setting in which the parties’ expected payoffs are determined endogenously through the strategic interaction between seller pricing and customer engagement and purchase. The customer tends to be engaged in equilibrium, as the uncertainty on the product’s basic value becomes higher to dilute the responsiveness of the optimal price to customer engagement. Therefore, the seller seeks to maximize the probability of generating an intermediate posterior belief. Thus, the optimal information design involves either exaggerating or downplaying the product’s basic value when the prior is low or high, respectively. We show that considering restrictive information structures can generate qualitatively different implications. We also examine how the unobservability of engagement may influence the parties’ strategic interaction, their expected payoffs, and the seller-optimal information design. Interestingly, unobservability may lead to lower equilibrium engagement, hurt the seller, render the customer’s equilibrium expected payoff to increase as customer engagement becomes less important or more costly, and yield more or less information provision.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <title>Consumer Privacy in Online Retail Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploitation of consumer data allows online retailers to enhance services provided to consumers but at the risk of causing unintended privacy issues. There has been debate about whether to devise regulation policies to restrict data collection and usage by online retailers. This paper studies the implications of newly adopted privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for an online retail supply chain comprising a retailer and a supplier. We find that despite the GDPR’s intention to safeguard consumer privacy, it may inadvertently hurt consumer surplus while benefiting the retailer. In fact, the GDPR may lead to an outcome detrimental to all parties involved, including the retailer, supplier, and consumers, thereby resulting in a triple-lose situation. Our results hold significant implications for consumers, supply chain firms, and policymakers alike, contributing to the existing literature on evaluating the impact of privacy regulations on technology innovation and adoption.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01819 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a measure of the speed of firm-level information diffusion, study how it is affected by limited attention, and examine its effect on real corporate decisions. Using local flu epidemics as exogenous attention shocks, we show that inattention from dual-covering analysts and cross-holding institutions reduces the speed of information diffusion from customer to supplier stock prices. We find that the speed of information diffusion along the supply chain affects the price feedback effect for corporate investment decisions and facilitates coordination between customers and suppliers. Our findings demonstrate that coattention from key market participants affects information efficiency and generates real economic outcomes.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How competition affects manipulation by firms of information about important attributes of their products and how such information manipulation impacts firms’ short-term and long-term performance are open empirical questions. We use a setting that is especially suitable for answering these questions—centralized crypto exchanges, on which information manipulation takes the form of inflated trading volume. We find that static and dynamic competition measures are positively associated with volume inflation, indicating that competition may lead to increased information manipulation. Exchanges that manipulate volume obtain short-run benefits but are punished in the long run, consistent with the trade-off between short-lived increases in rents and future losses because of damaged reputation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 2225/21], the Coller School of Management Blockchain Research Institute, the Henry Crown Institute for Business Research in Israel, and the Cornell Fintech Initiative for financial support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02903 .</content>

    <title>Sharing the Fame but Taking the Blame: When Declaring a Single Person Responsible Solves a Free Rider Problem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teams are formed because input from different people is needed. Providing incentives to team members, however, can be difficult. According to received wisdom, declaring all members responsible fails because real responsibility for team output “diffuses.” But why? Also, why and when does formally declaring one member “responsible” mean that this member can be attributed real responsibility? We offer a model that answers these questions. We identify when jointly declaring a team responsible results in reputation free riding. We show that declaring one person responsible can overcome this problem but only if all other team members are protected from being sanctioned.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>Stressed Banks? Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study short-term and medium-term changes in bank risk-taking as a result of supervision and the associated real effects. For identification, we exploit the European Central Bank’s asset-quality-review (AQR) in conjunction with security and credit registers. After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit supply, with the greatest effect on riskiest securities. We find negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit availability. Moreover, nonbanks with higher exposure to reviewed banks acquire the shed risk. After the AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities but not riskier credit, resulting in negative medium-term firm-level real effects. These effects are especially strong for firms with high ex ante credit risk. Among these nonsafe firms, even those with high ex ante productivity, experience negative real effects. Our findings suggest that banks’ liquid assets help them to mask risk from supervisors and risk adjustments banks make in response to supervision have persistent corporate real effects.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: J.-L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relationship between a firm’s successful protest of a government agency’s conduct or terms of a procurement contract and the amount of business the firm conducts with the government going forward. We find firms receive fewer and less valuable government contracts, face more contract cancellations, and experience significant reductions in sales growth and employee growth. Despite widespread belief, successful bid protesters do not delay government procurement because of lengthy dispute resolutions. Overall, we provide the first analysis of corporate interactions with the United States government bid protest system.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02055 .</content>

    <title>Selling Data to Marketers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The supply and the demand for data analytics are growing rapidly. Recent years have seen a surge in the availability of massive consumer data and in the emergence of data sellers (e.g., brokers and intermediaries). Unlike standard products, the value of data analytics for marketers depends on how their business decisions can be enabled and improved. In this paper, we investigate how a monopoly seller can offer a menu of data-based service plans to screen heterogenous marketers that can decide whether to take an action (e.g., direct selling, targeting, lending) with uncertain value and privately known cost. We characterize how, and for which marketers, the provision of information may be distorted in the optimal design. We present conditions under which optimally supplied information can be socially excessive or insufficient. It is shown that selling data appends may yield double reversals in the optimal service plans, in comparison with those when the seller’s offerings serve as marketing lists (i.e., the action is infeasible under the marketers’ outside option). We articulate how these results are coherently driven by the same underlying mechanism regarding how the marginal value of information is endogenously derived from the improvement in the marketers’ decision making over their default action. We also examine how our results can be enriched in alternative settings on the production and the costs of information.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <title>The Value of Specific Knowledge: Evidence from Disruptions to the Patient–Physician Relationship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a member of a work team leaves, some knowledge is lost to the organization. Exploiting quasi-random turnover among military physicians because of deployments, I estimate the effects of turnover on patients and other providers in the same care team. I find that a discontinuity in primary care leads to a 3%–5% increase in costs driven primarily by an increase in the use and intensity of specialty care with no observable benefit to the patient as measured by potential reductions in hospitalization rates and emergency department usage. This indicates that the full cost of turnover includes a reduction in access to knowledge among remaining members of the team.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03884 .</content>

    <title>Long Lags and Large Returns: Experimental Evidence from Advertising to Businesses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a multiyear experiment, we show that advertising to businesses can generate very different responses than has been observed for consumers. First, we estimate larger advertising returns than typically found for consumers: a return on ad spend of 12.0 (95% CI: 4.8–24.5). Second, we estimate longer lags between ad delivery and purchase: 1–5 months for first-time purchases and 5–12 months or longer for repeat purchases. Third, we find that existing business customers are responsible for most of the revenue lift from advertising, though this appears to be driven by existing business customers purchasing new parts. Additionally, our results demonstrate that geography-based switchback experiments that randomize the time between treatments can provide an effective means of estimating lagged effects. For this study we randomized the delivery of digital display ads for electronic components offered by a semiconductor manufacturer; nearly all electronic products require such components.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: M.

    <title>Market Ambiguity Attitude Restores the Risk-Return Trade-Off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A positive relation between the conditional mean and conditional volatility of aggregate stock returns, although viewed as a fundamental law of finance, has been challenging to find empirically. We consider a representative agent asset pricing model with Knightian uncertainty and demonstrate that this risk-return trade-off depends on the agent’s ambiguity attitude (reflecting the agent’s degree of optimism or pessimism). The model predicts that the conditional equity premium is increasing in market volatility, but its slope flattens as market optimism rises. We develop a methodology to extract the representative agent’s ambiguity attitude from our asset pricing model. Results validate our model predictions. We document the significant in-sample and out-of-sample explanatory power of ambiguity attitude in explaining the risk-return trade-off. In our sample, market volatility is not significant in forecasting returns. However, including the market ambiguity attitude leads to a significant positive relationship between volatility and future returns. Hence, our model and results identify market ambiguity attitude as a missing state variable that can explain why the literature has found it difficult to empirically validate the risk-return trade-off.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03595 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct the first large-scale study of how different stakeholder groups assess corporate culture and quantify the economic implications of those differences. We employ generative AI to analyze analyst reports, call transcripts, and employee reviews, and organize the extracted information into a knowledge graph that links a culture type to its perceived causes and effects. We demonstrate that the divergence in different stakeholder groups’ assessment of culture aligns with their distinct roles and economic incentives. Moreover, we show that analysts’ culture analyses are incorporated into stock recommendations and target prices, and investors react to divergence in stakeholders’ assessment of culture.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the Tutoring Online Program (TOP), where tutoring is entirely online and tutors are volunteer university students matched with underprivileged middle school students. We leverage random assignment to estimate effects during and after the pandemic (2020 and 2022), investigating channels of impact. Three hours of individual tutoring per week increased math performance by 0.22 SD in 2020 and 0.20 SD in 2022. Higher dosage yielded stronger effects, while group tutoring smaller effects. TOP enhanced students’ aspirations, socioemotional skills, and psychological well-being, but only during school closures. We also estimate the impact of TOP on tutors, finding an increase in empathy.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a monetary quasi–experiment in Sweden from 2010–2011, when the Riksbank raised the interest rate substantially. We argue that this increase was beyond what labor market conditions warranted, driven instead by new concerns about financial stability. Using a battery of specifications that rule out domestic or international confounders, we show that this monetary tightening led to a substantial economic contraction, raising unemployment by 1–2 percentage points. Using administrative microdata, we find that sectors with nominal wage rigidity drove much of the response and that the monetary contraction was more regressive than the typical business cycle.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adverse selection benefits firms able to identify talent. An informed intermediary expropriates agents’ ability by threatening to fire and expose them to undervaluation of their skill. An agent’s track record gradually reduces intermediary’s information advantage. In response, the intermediary starts churning well-performing agents she knows are less skilled. The accelerated reduction in information advantage boosts profits, as retained agents accept below-reservation wages to build reputation faster. Agents prefer starting their careers working for an intermediary, as benefits from building reputation faster more than offset expropriation costs. Our analysis applies to professions where talent is essential and performance is publicly observable. (JEL D21, D82, J23, J24, J31, J63, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a linear GMM estimator of the discrete-time mixed proportional hazard (MPH) model of duration with an arbitrary distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. We allow for competing risks, observable characteristics, and censoring. We prove our estimator is consistent and apply it to the duration of price spells. We find substantial unobserved heterogeneity with economically meaningful implications for the response of output to a monetary policy shock in a model with time-dependent pricing rules and for the degree of state dependence in a model of price plans.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Did credit drive the 2000s housing cycle? The existing literature’s findings range from credit having no effect to credit explaining most of the cycle. We show that these disparate results hinge on the extent to which landlords absorb credit-driven demand, which depends on the degree of housing market segmentation. We develop a model that nests cases between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically considered, estimate an elasticity that pins down the degree of segmentation, and use it to calibrate our model. We find credit standards played an important role, explaining 32 percent to 53 percent of the boom. (JEL E32, E44, G51, R21, R31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;International migrants may facilitate the transmission of ideas across countries. We examine the impact of migrant exposure to reproductive health policies on origin-country fertility in the Philippines. We exploit temporal variation in destination-country reproductive health policies combined with spatial variation across Philippine provinces in their migration intensity and historical composition of migrant destinations. Migrant exposure to more liberalized reproductive health policies reduces origin-community fertility. This reduction is driven by increased adoption of modern contraceptives. Visible policy changes, such as commercial advertising of contraceptives, lead to this change in behavior. Firmly established family planning values moderate the fertility response.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal income taxation in a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous locational preferences, labor supply decisions, and competitive housing and labor markets. Expressions characterizing the optimal tax schedule in each community are provided that capture the fiscal externalities associated with migration and the effects of redistribution between households and landlords. Correlation between skill and locational preferences yields optimal transfers to poor areas, while sorting based on comparative advantage can motivate transfers in either direction. A calibration to areas targeted by the US Empowerment Zone program yields sizable optimal spatial transfers that are sensitive to assumed levels of migration responsiveness.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy-relevant treatment effect estimation in a marketplace setting requires assessing both the direct treatment benefit and spillovers induced by changes to the market equilibrium. We show how to identify and estimate policy-relevant treatment effects using a unit-randomized trial run within a single large market. A Bernoulli-randomized trial allows consistent estimation of direct effects and of treatment-heterogeneity measures that enable welfare-improving targeting. Estimating spillovers—and providing confidence intervals for the direct effect—requires estimates of price elasticities, which we provide using an augmented experimental design. We illustrate our results using a simulation calibrated to a conditional cash-transfer experiment in the Philippines. (JEL C21, C51, I32, I38, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Software is one of the most important assets that needs to be priced in the digital economy. It has emerged as a disruptive technology, with companies primarily valued for their software offerings growing from 2 percent to 13 percent of market share between 1996 and 2023. We document persistent anomalies in growth forecasts and stock returns for software companies, indicating significant deviations from rational expectations over multiple decades. Our findings are consistent with Bayesian investors gradually learning about software’s growing importance, highlighting how markets can be very slow to discern fundamental shifts from transient shocks in noisy data.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how individual political views shape firm behavior and labor market outcomes using new microdata from Brazil. We first show that business owners are considerably more likely to employ copartisan workers. This phenomenon is in part driven by the overlapping of political and social networks. Multiple tests—surveys, event studies, analyses of wage premia and promotions within the firm, and a field experiment—further highlight how business owners’ political preferences directly influence firms’ employment decisions. A channel of political discrimination appears more relevant than one of political quid pro quo between firms and politicians. (JEL C93, D22, D72, J23, M51, O17, Z13)</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate public support and venture capital (VC) investment in academic startups. Government support may enable follow‐on investment by providing a quality signal to investors. This signal is especially important for academic startups, which face large funding gaps due to their complexity, cutting‐edge nature, and uncertainty regarding the founders' management capabilities and commitment. Using a panel of startups in Germany, our analyses confirm that academic startups are more likely to obtain follow‐on VC investment after receiving public support than non‐academic startups. Further, this effect is limited in time, lasts longer for academic startups, is concentrated in high‐tech manufacturing firms, and is stronger for investments from business angels. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking to foster academic entrepreneurship through policy programs and VC investment.Managerial SummaryObtaining seed and growth capital is essential for potentially highly innovative startups. We show that startups that obtain public support are more likely to receive VC funding and that this effect is stronger for startups with academic founders, approximately twice as large. We further show that this benefit is limited in time, concentrated in the high‐tech manufacturing industry, and more salient for business angel financing than for investment by independent VC funds or corporate VCs. For founders of academic startups, our results imply that acquiring public support might enhance the chances of attracting follow‐on financing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An entrepreneur’s negative attitude toward debt (debt aversion) affects the financing decisions of the businesses they run. Controlling for a range of observable traits, firms run by highly debt-averse entrepreneurs are about 10 percentage points less likely to use debt. The same entrepreneurs are also almost 25% less likely to take up government-guaranteed debt during the COVID-19 crisis. These firms show less interest in COVID-19 support policies if they perceive them to involve debt based on experiments randomizing the framing and labeling of otherwise nearly identical hypothetical COVID-19 support policies as debt or grants.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.

    <title>Getting the Most Out of A/B Tests Using the Asymptotic Minimax-Regret Criteria</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms conduct A/B tests to find a marketing action that improves a value of interest, such as revenue or profit. We develop the asymptotic minimax regret (AMMR) criterion, a practical decision-theoretic approach for choosing among binary marketing actions based on A/B tests. The AMMR is a general large-sample approximation of the minimax-regret criterion from a frequentist standpoint. Our method directly optimizes the decision-relevant metric, accounting for the product of the error probability and the associated magnitude of value loss. Implementing the AMMR decision rule is straightforward; it comprises simply comparing the standardized treatment-effect estimate to the AMMR-optimal decision threshold. The AMMR suggests selecting the treatment whenever the point estimate is positive, as this minimizes the maximum expected net loss from decision errors. A case study of a mobile game company’s A/B testing with Monte Carlo validation demonstrates that the AMMR decision rule effectively selects the optimal marketing action and improves revenue across various data-generating processes.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: K.

    <title>Understanding Talent in Foreign Subsidiaries: A Review, Synthesis, and Way Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations are strategically important, requiring them to tailor their human capital resources to specific needs. Although talent serves as the micro‐level foundation of subsidiaries' organizational‐level human capital resources and strategic outcomes, the current literature is fragmented and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is known, what remains unknown, and what future research should explore about talent in subsidiaries. To this end, we synthesize the literature on talent in subsidiaries over the past two decades, mapping it onto the model of human capital resources emergence. First, we build on existing classifications by integrating the recognized distinction between headquarters‐assigned or locally hired talent with talent nationality, providing a structured perspective that better reflects the realities of subsidiary talent. Second, we examine how talent's individual knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) and social interactions evolve into four subsidiary‐level human capital resources, which in turn contribute to a variety of strategic subsidiary outcomes. Finally, we conclude our review with a future research agenda.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <title>Perceptions of knowledge transferability and entrepreneurial entry: The role of firm‐initiated turnover</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the understudied effects of perceived non‐transferable knowledge on labor market choices after firm‐initiated turnover. Using a large, nationally representative dataset, I assess how workers' perceptions of knowledge transferability, expectations to remain at a firm, and type of turnover experienced correlate with the decision to engage in entrepreneurship. I find that the release of workers with perceived non‐transferable knowledge into the external environment through firm‐initiated turnover reliably foreshadows entrepreneurship, especially as workers' prior expectations to continue wage employment at a source firm increases. This finding indicates that beyond necessity, opportunity and financial resources, workers' self‐perceptions of their human capital and unfulfilled career expectations matter to the choice of entrepreneurship. It also suggests that firm‐initiated turnover may be a form of knowledge divestiture with important ex‐post implications when workers' perceptions of transferability align with reality.Managerial SummaryManagers often overlook the role of employees' self‐perceptions in shaping post‐turnover career decisions. This study highlights that workers who perceive their knowledge as non‐transferable—skills and expertise they believe cannot easily be applied to other employers—are more likely to pursue entrepreneurship following firm‐initiated turnover. This trend is particularly pronounced among workers who expected to remain in wage employment but were unexpectedly terminated. Firm‐initiated turnover, while serving to shed human capital, can inadvertently encourage the creation of entrepreneurial ventures that may compete with the firm. To mitigate unintended outcomes, firms should (a) recognize the strategic implications of firm‐initiated turnover as a form of knowledge divestiture, with implications for both the firm and the broader market, (b) reevaluate how they manage exits for employees with the firm's specialized knowledge, to reduce the risk of competitive ventures, and (c) engage in open dialogue to align employee expectations with organizational strategies, considering retention or redeployment options for those at risk of a forced exit. By understanding how workers' perceptions and unmet expectations influence their career paths, firms can make more informed decisions about human capital management and turnover strategies, potentially reducing unintended competitive risks while fostering long‐term relationships with former employees.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 2,000 professionals in 24 large corporations in Türkiye, we explore the relationship between female leadership and the relational culture in the workplace. First, we document that although male and female leaders possess equal cognitive capacity, they diverge in socioemotional characteristics. Next, we show that the relational dynamics in the workplace are different under male and female leadership. Male employees form homophilic professional ties under male leadership, whereas we observe less gender-segregated networks under female leadership, where both males and females establish more links with their female colleagues. Female employees receive more support from their leaders and are less likely to quit under female leadership. However, female employees working under female leaders report worse workplace satisfaction and meritocracy. Delving into the mechanisms reveals that female employees depict a gloomier workplace climate in the absence of social support from their female leader. Overall, our findings highlight the influential role of social support from leaders and suggest that increasing supportive female presence in leadership positions may be an effective way to foster a more inclusive relational culture in the workplace.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Science Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy [Grant EXC 2126/1–390838866].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05507 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the preferences of 10,000 capital owners worldwide, including nearly 3,000 from the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, regarding green shareholder voting and divestment. Findings indicate substantial support (53%–72%) for shareholder engagement and green voting, which is more popular and less politically divisive than divestment. Preferences for green voting increase with the likelihood of green outcomes being implemented though 63% of the payoff is attributed to expressive benefits. These results suggest that shareholder engagement and green voting could play a central role in a broader climate strategy portfolio.This paper was accepted by Caroline Flammer, sustainability.Funding: This work was supported by The Norwegian Finance Market Fund (Finansmarkedsfondet).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08186 .</content>

Using loan listings from Prosper, we find that borrowers adjust their willingness-to-pay interest rates in response to unexpected Federal funds rate changes, whereas anticipated shifts have negligible effects. These responses are more pronounced among high-income, high-credit-score borrowers; large loan applicants; and when Federal Reserve communication is transparent. The responses are highly asymmetric—Borrowers sharply lower rates during unexpected easing but resist increasing them during unexpected tightening. The results are robust to alternative specifications, including regression-discontinuity-in-time designs and alternative measures of monetary policy shock. Lenders also respond to policy shocks and counteract borrowers’ adjustments. Analysis of Robinhood data shows that retail investors mirror this behavior by reducing equity holdings after surprise rate hikes.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the general research fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong [Grant 17504925], the Dean’s Research Fund of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, The Education University of Hong Kong [Grant FLASS/DRF 04635], the Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology [Grant FRG-24-019-MSB], the Seed Funding Grant of EdUHK [Grant 02C11], and the Block Grant Blueprint of EdUHK [Grant 02A23].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04649 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Public and Buyer‐Driven Governance for Supplier Sustainability Development in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments and regulatory agencies in emerging countries are increasingly enforcing labor and environmental protection laws. However, how this growing public governance interrelates with existing buyer‐driven governance to influence supplier sustainability development remains unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal case study involving two rounds of extensive data collection at nine Chinese suppliers of COSMOS, a European multinational company in the consumer electronics industry. We identify three distinctive configurations of how public governance and buyer‐driven governance jointly influence supplier sustainability development. Identifying these configurations builds on prior research that distinguishes between competitive, complementary, and coexistent interactions between public and private governance. We extend this literature by uncovering the causal mechanisms through which each configuration gives rise to a unique sustainability development trajectory. Specifically, we unpack the different elements of each configuration and analyze their influence on suppliers' willingness and ability to pursue sustainability improvement. We conclude by delineating the boundary conditions that define the generalizability of our findings across contexts.</content>

    <title>Bridging the Divide: How Dual‐Background Leaders Unlock Returnee Innovation in Politically Connected Chinese Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how firm leadership diversity influences innovation, focusing on the interplay between returnee leaders – those with international experience – and politically connected leaders. While returnee leaders introduce globally derived innovation practices, their efforts often clash with the state‐aligned agendas of politically connected leaders. By integrating bridging mechanisms into upper echelons theory, we introduce dual‐background leaders – executives with both political and international experience – to bridge these divergent cognitive logics. Through a longitudinal analysis of Chinese publicly listed firms from 2006 to 2016, we find that the positive effect of returnee leaders on innovation performance is significantly weakened in firms with high political connectivity, especially in the absence of dual‐background leaders. Conversely, firms that effectively integrate dual‐background leaders are better positioned to reconcile competing innovation agendas and unlock the synergistic potential of leadership diversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine hidden orders usage by algorithmic traders (ATs) and nonATs. ATs extensively use hidden orders but of smaller size than nonATs, who are the primary contributors to hidden volume. ATs’ relative share of hidden volume decreases with volatility, adverse selection costs, and the relative tick-size. Proprietary ATs (HFTs), who differ from agency ATs (AATs) in their information sets and potential gains from trade, hide orders to reduce competition for liquidity provision, whereas AATs use hidden orders to conceal information in their more informed orders and manage picking-off risk. Finally, superior technology provides limited benefit for hidden order execution.</content>

    <title>The Determinants of ESG Ratings: Rater Ownership Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how common ownership affects Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—an important research question given the increasing use of these ratings in investment decisions and corporate evaluations. We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an asymptotic framework for conducting inference on continuous-time asset pricing models using high-frequency returns over an increasing time horizon. Our study focuses on the identification and estimation of risk premiums associated with the continuous component and jumps of various size brackets. We extend the classical Fama-MacBeth regression from the discrete-time setting to a continuous-time factor model, incorporating general dynamics for factors, idiosyncratic components, and factor loadings. Our empirical analysis of U.S. equities, foreign exchange, and commodities underscores the distinct significance of continuous and jump risk premiums for the specific factors constructed within each asset class in determining expected returns.</content>

    <title>Incentive alignment in ecosystems: The role of complementarity types and multi‐sided bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alignment of incentives to improve value creation in ecosystems is crucial to their growth and survival. We examine how two fundamental ecosystem features affect alignment: types of complementarities and their interplay with multi‐sided bargaining over value. Using a formal model, we find that multi‐sided bargaining typically causes misalignment, in patterns that vary dramatically depending on the type of complementarities. For instance, we find that multiplicative complementarities typically entail weak alignment among participants. In contrast, when value creation is constrained by the weakest component, alignment can be alternatively very strong or very weak. We also find that the starting levels of participants' functionality matter. This suggests new avenues for assessing ecosystem performance and the potential for alignment among participants.Managerial SummaryManagers of firms operating in ecosystems need to understand the factors that make their partners aligned with the objective of increasing the ecosystem's value creation. Our research shows that, under multi‐sided bargaining, a major driver of incentive alignment is the type of complementarity between ecosystem's components, that is, how the different pieces of the ecosystem contribute to value creation. Depending on the complementarity type (multiplicative, additive, and weakest‐link), and ecosystem partners' starting levels of functionalities, we show which combinations are intrinsically favorable for aligning development incentives and which ones may undermine alignment. These findings can serve as a guide to diagnose the potential for misalignment among ecosystem partners and how much value creation is at stake.</content>

    <title>Mobilizing the silent majority: Discourse broadening and audience support for entrepreneurial innovations</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs operating in a public interactional domain face a unique communicative challenge: they must leverage conversations with a small subset of vocal discursive partners to mobilize support from a broader base of silent audiences observing these exchanges. I propose that entrepreneurs who engage with these vocal discursive partners using what I refer to asdiscourse broadeningare more likely to successfully gain support from the broader silent audience. Using a computational linguistics model to analyze discourses on an online platform featuring entrepreneurial innovations, this study finds an inverted U‐shaped relationship between discourse broadening and support from silent audience members. This relationship is moderated by the similarity between the interpretative lenses of discursive partners and silent audience members, which influences the trade‐off between the benefits and costs of discourse broadening.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face the critical challenge of persuading broader audiences to support their novel ideas despite having limited opportunities to interact with them directly. This article examines how entrepreneurs can strategically engage with their immediate conversational partners on online platforms to gain support from a wider base of silent observers. The findings show that entrepreneurs must carefully balance the extent to which they broaden the discourse with their conversational partners to maximize support from the broader audience. They also need to tailor the level of discourse broadening based on how much their conversational partners represent the views of silent observers. These insights reveal a discursive strategy that entrepreneurs can leverage on online platforms to increase the likelihood of success in commercializing their innovations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human decision-makers frequently override the recommendations generated by predictive algorithms, but it is unclear whether these discretionary overrides add valuable private information or reintroduce human biases and mistakes. We develop new quasi-experimental tools to measure the impact of human discretion over an algorithm on the accuracy of decisions, even when the outcome of interest is only selectively observed, in the context of bail decisions. We find that 90% of the judges in our setting underperform the algorithm when they make a discretionary override, with most making override decisions that are no better than random. Yet the remaining 10% of judges outperform the algorithm in terms of both accuracy and fairness when they make a discretionary override. We provide suggestive evidence on the behavior underlying these differences in judge performance, showing that the high-performing judges are more likely to use relevant private information and are less likely to overreact to highly salient events compared to the low-performing judges.</content>

    <title>A double-edged sword: materiality classifications of sustainability topics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has classified sustainability topics as material or not material for investors. We leverage the staggered release of the SASB classifications from 2013 to 2016 to examine whether and how they prompt changes in U.S. firms’ sustainability performance. We measure sustainability performance using RepRisk scores, which reflect environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incidents. We find that RepRisk scores on sustainability topics classified as material decrease following the release of SASB classifications. Conversely, incident scores on nonmaterial sustainability topics increase. This suggests that firms improve their sustainability performance on topics the SASB deems relevant for investors while simultaneously performing worse on irrelevant topics. Firms adjust their internal sustainability policies to mirror these changes. The changes in sustainability performance occur primarily through two channels. We document that higher exposure to the classifications from shareholder pressure and sustainability-linked executive compensation prompts managers to prioritize sustainability topics classified as relevant for investors over irrelevant ones.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a field experiment, we find that a mandatory mentorship program raises worker productivity, whereas a voluntary version of the program does not. A significant reason why the mandatory program results in larger gains is that the lowest-productivity employees do not participate when the program is voluntary despite their having the greatest treatment benefits. A nationally representative survey of U.S. workers shows wide variation in human capital development program participation, suggesting that understanding self-selection is important for firms’ returns on these programs across a variety of settings. Our findings have implications for resource allocation, experimental design, productivity dispersion, and inequality.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07524 .</content>

    <title>How Middle Managers Affect Frontline Idea Generation: Evidence From Healthcare Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This multiple case study develops a mid‐range theory on how frontline idea generation is affected by the actions of an organization's middle management. The study draws from four acute‐care hospitals in Germany and involves 36 semi‐structured interviews with representatives from all hierarchy levels. We use mission statements from these hospitals to measure top management's strategic intent regarding frontline idea generation. Then we analyze the idea generation performance of 156 nurses from the hospitals and link it to specific middle management behaviors. The cross‐case analyses reveal that middle managers' shaping of nurses' innovation identity improves nurses' idea generation performance. However, this connection also means that middle managers' own forays into innovation can impede frontline idea generation. We find that middle managers' supportive behavior is largely independent of top management intent, a dynamic that offers both advantages and risks. These insights extend our knowledge about the role of middle managers in frontline idea generation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Temporal Patterns of New Product Introductions and IPO Value: The Importance of Recency, Dispersion, and Asymmetry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s innovation activity is often judged by the number and type of new products it launches, butwhenthese products are introduced may be equally important, especially before going public. This research investigates how the temporal pattern of new product introductions (NPIs) influences a firm’s initial public offering (IPO) value. The analysis uses data from 298 firms that went public between 2006 and 2023, and focuses on three patterns of timing: recency (how recently the latest product was launched before the IPO), dispersion (the degree to which NPIs before the IPO are spread out over time), and asymmetry (how disproportionately NPIs were launched over time before the IPO). Results demonstrate that firms with more dispersed NPIs achieve higher IPO value, whereas firms that introduce a product just before the IPO or introduce several new products disproportionately closer to the IPO tend to perform worse. Findings show that 1% increases in recency, dispersion, or asymmetry result in a 1.34% decrease, 3.65% increase, and 1.03% decrease, respectively, in IPO value, and these vary depending on the firm’s industry growth and product innovativeness. Results provide new insights for theory and practice, highlighting that innovation timing is a key determinant of IPO performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Psychological Ownership and Territorial Behaviors in Rental Transactions: Why “Who” You Rent from Matters</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The phenomenal growth in rentals, with the advent of access-based platforms, has made it possible for consumers to rent products from person providers (e.g., Alex on Airbnb) and company providers (e.g., Apex Vacations on Airbnb). But does “who” a consumer rents from matter? Across nine experiments (including one with real behaviors), we demonstrate that despite the product being the same, consumers differ in how they feel about the product depending on “who” they are renting from. Consumers feel stronger psychological ownership for the product when renting from company providers than person providers. These feelings of psychological ownership drive consumers to engage in “territorial” behaviors – actions that assert their claim on the rented product (e.g., moving furniture in a rental cabin). Consequently, consumers are more willing to exhibit such behaviors when renting from company providers than person providers. These behaviors impose real costs on rental providers through increased operational burdens and property damage, as exemplified through additional analyses of providers’comments on Airbnb’s community platform and interviews with providers. We further identify strategies to mitigate consumers’ territorial behaviors by altering consumers’ feelings of psychological ownership through its antecedent in the rental context: provider’s connection to the rental product.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores U.S. public firms’ cryptocurrency holdings and accounting practices from 2013 to 2022 against the backdrop of the recently enacted crypto accounting rule, ASU 2023‐08. Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manipulated consumer reviews are a growing concern for digital platforms, undermining trust and distorting market outcomes. This study analyzes data from the Apple App Store to assess how both positive and negative manipulated reviews—later filtered by the platform—affect app sales rankings. Surprisingly, both one-star and five-star manipulated reviews initially boost app rankings, even when one-star reviews are intended to harm competitors. These effects can persist for weeks and take up to six months to reverse through platform filtering. Using text analysis, we find that negative manipulated reviews are linguistically more distinguishable from organic ones than are positive manipulated reviews, making them easier for consumers to spot. Our results show that review volume often outweighs valence in influencing consumer behavior, and that manipulated reviews have stronger effects on free apps, gaming apps, and apps from large developers. These findings underscore the urgency for platform managers to invest in faster, more accurate filtering systems, and highlight the need for policymakers to strengthen governance mechanisms to protect marketplace integrity and consumer trust.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For sellers of experience goods, consumer uncertainty threatens profits. Resale platforms and enhanced consumer learning are popular tools to manage this uncertainty, but their impacts differ significantly and require tailored strategies. Our research reveals critical nuances overlooked by prior studies: the resale platform’s negative effect is often underestimated because of its indirect influence on consumer waiting behavior, whereas consumer learning can harm sellers of high-cost goods when consumers are impatient. Critically, the profitability and environmental outcomes depend on production costs and consumer patience. Encouraging consumer learning creates a profit-environment win–win with patient consumers, whereas resale platforms excel with impatient consumers and high costs. Combining both mechanisms benefits sellers only when consumers are patient and costs are moderate ([Formula: see text]"). Key strategic imperatives emerge: (i) resale behavior: encourage selectively (beneficial mainly for high-cost goods), minimizing resale discounts; (ii) learning behavior: nurture consumer patience and avoid rushing purchases, especially for premium goods; and (iii) product upgrades: avoid frequent, minor updates. Sellers must move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches, aligning their uncertainty management (resale, learning, upgrades) with product economics and consumer patience to optimize profits and sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study of nascent entrepreneurship lies at the core of entrepreneurship scholarship, offering critical insights into how both entrepreneurs and ventures emerge through a contextually embedded process. This review synthesizes findings from 95 peer-reviewed articles that employ the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), two comprehensive longitudinal datasets specifically focusing on nascent entrepreneurship. Using thematic analysis, we synthesize the literature into three core dimensions—the entrepreneur, the entrepreneurial process, and the venture—and emphasize the role of context. Although research on individuals and ventures is relatively well developed, the process dimension remains underexplored, and contextual influences warrant further investigation. We also identify key methodological challenges—particularly related to construct validity—as well as emerging methodological innovations. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, underscoring the need for more large-scale initiatives and opportunities to re-engage with the PSED’s untapped potential to advance understanding of entrepreneurial emergence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study adopts a Bourdieusian lens to examine how founders’ social class origin influences venture performance through a central aspect of entrepreneurial habitus—risk-taking. In Study 1, we find that risk-taking mediates the relationship between social class origin and venture performance, advantaging those from higher social class origins. In an archival dataset, we show that an alternative measure of childhood social class similarly predicts risk-taking among self-employed individuals. In Study 2, we investigate how field-specific social capital moderates this pathway through founders’ social networks. These findings advance understanding of how early-life social class conditions shape entrepreneurial behavior and performance and imply the need for more nuanced and class-inclusive support within entrepreneurial ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether the interplay of social comparisons in housing and rising income inequality contributed to the household debt boom in the United States between 1980 and 2007. We develop a tractable macroeconomic model with general social comparisons in housing to show that changes in the distribution of income affect aggregate housing demand, aggregate debt, and house prices if (and only if) social comparisons are asymmetric. In the empirically relevant case of upward-looking comparisons, rising inequality can rationalize a substantial share of the observed housing and debt boom.

    <title>A Walrasian Mechanism with Markups for Nonconvex Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce markup equilibrium—an extension of Walrasian equilibrium in which consumers pay a fixed percentage markup over producer prices. In quasilinear markets, markup equilibria exist despite nonconvexities. They are resource-feasible and envy-free, incur no budget deficit, and require little more communication and computation than ordinary Walrasian equilibrium. The associated markup mechanism is asymptotically incentive-compatible. We also introduce a Bound-Form First Welfare Theorem, which states that for any feasible allocation, the welfare loss compared to the first-best is bounded, using any price vector, by the sum of the resulting (i) budget surplus and (ii) rationing losses suffered by the participants. Using producer prices, this bound implies that any markup equilibrium with a small markup and few unallocated goods is nearly efficient.</content>

    <title>Auditor-provided nonpublic signals of misreporting and CFO dismissal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research suggests that board members value financial reporting quality because executive dismissal often follows low reporting quality events. However, inferences about the board’s demand for reporting quality in these studies are confounded by board members’ reputation incentives because the events examined are public (e.g., restatements). We investigate boards’ demand for reporting quality by exploiting aprivatesignal of misreporting: audit adjustments communicated to the Board by the external auditor. We first survey 29 audit committee chairs to understand whether boards use audit adjustments in their oversight of management and then conduct an empirical investigation to answer our research question. We find an increased likelihood of CFO dismissal following audit adjustments. This association is driven by adjustments that reduce income and by firms with better board oversight. These findings suggest that boards proactively use nonpublic signals of reporting quality and incorporate information from auditors into their monitoring function.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Facilitating Review Information Disclosure in the Platform Economy: Is More Accurate Always Better?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online consumer reviews (OCRs) publicly disclose consumer uncertainty about product valuations, enabling firms to acquire more accurate demand information. This paper develops a game-theoretic model in which a manufacturer sells products through both physical stores and a third-party online platform, which may operate in reselling or agency business modes. We investigate the interplay between OCR disclosure and business mode choices. We find that the manufacturer and the platform generally share aligned interests in OCR disclosure across business modes, with the information value of OCRs shaped by their accuracy and the uncertainty of consumers regarding product valuations. Specifically, OCR disclosure benefits both parties, yet it leads to higher gains for the manufacturer than the platform in the reselling mode, whereas their profit gains depend on the commission rate in the agency mode. When either consumer uncertainty about product valuations or the accuracy of OCRs is relatively low, both parties prefer the agency mode if the commission rate is moderate or the reselling mode if it is sufficiently high. When both consumer uncertainty about product valuations and the accuracy of OCRs are sufficiently high, both parties prefer the agency mode only if the commission rate is sufficiently high. Notably, the effects of OCR disclosure on the equilibrium business mode selection are non-monotonic: More accurate OCR disclosure facilitates the realization of an equilibrium business mode when the initial accuracy of OCRs is low and inhibits it when their accuracy is high. Last, we find that limited disclosure of OCRs and an endogenous commission rate can be employed as strategic tools to align business mode preferences. Our findings caution against the assumption that full OCR disclosure uniformly benefits platforms and manufacturers, and we offer practical insights for the design and operation of review systems.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Portfolio Allocation Under Market Incompleteness and Wealth Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dynamic Portfolio Allocation Under Market Incompleteness and Wealth EffectsIn the paper “Dynamic portfolio allocation under market incompleteness and wealth effects,” a novel decomposition of an optimal dynamic portfolio is developed under general incomplete-market models and the wealth-dependent hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility. It shows that with hedgeable interest rate risk, the optimal portfolio consists of two parts: a pure constant relative risk aversion optimal portfolio and a financing bond portfolio for investor future subsistence requirements. Under such a structure, the wealth growth rate is always higher for HARA investors with more initial wealth, leading to increased wealth inequality regardless of the underlying model dynamics and realized market scenario. Using the decomposition, the authors solve the HARA optimal policy in closed form under an incomplete-market model with both stochastic interest rate and volatility. The wealth effect in the optimal portfolio has interesting implications. It generates a procyclical pattern in investor stock positions and time-varying risk aversion levels as well as a “buy high, sell low” market timing effect that may hurt HARA investors with low initial wealth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper shows that competing firms with competitive advantages in distinct attributes can credibly coordinate their messaging about attribute importance, reducing consumer uncertainty and generating category demand. A truthful equilibrium arises in which each firm highlights the more important attribute—even when at a disadvantage—but such an equilibrium does not exist without competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the estimation of dynamic economic models for which some of the state variables are observed only occasionally by the econometrician—a common problem in many fields, ranging from marketing to finance to industrial organization. If those occasional state observations are serially correlated, the likelihood function of the model becomes a high-dimensional integral over a nonstandard domain. We generalize the recursive likelihood function integration procedure to incorporate the occasional observations, enabling likelihood-based inference in such estimation problems. In extensive Monte Carlo studies, we demonstrate the favorable properties of the proposed method for identifying all model parameters and compare it to alternative methods.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lack of comovement between consumption differentials and real exchange rates is a traditional indicator of a disconnect of foreign exchange markets from economic fundamentals. We present novel empirical evidence for the disconnect between the volatilities, as opposed to the levels, of these variables. The volatility correlations are below one, but they are larger than the level correlations. We discuss the economics of volatility disconnect anomaly in settings with complete and incomplete markets and provide an explanation of our empirical findings based on international risk sharing of expected growth and volatility news shocks.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: Y.

    <title>Vaccines at Work: Experimental Evidence from a Firm Campaign</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health campaigns in firms could be a cost-effective approach to reduce sickness absence and to mitigate negative economic consequences of ill health among employees. Low participation rates, however, may prevent firms from realizing such private economic benefits. Moreover, employees may overestimate the effects of the campaign and engage in risky behaviors that could be detrimental to their health, thereby reducing the potential benefits of the intervention. We ran a natural field experiment with a bank in Ecuador, where we employed a randomized encouragement design by experimentally manipulating incentives to participate in a campaign to get vaccinated against influenza. This allows us to study the determinants of on-site vaccination and the consequences of increased participation in a firm campaign for employees, thereby informing about the private incentives for firms to run such interventions. Using rich administrative records merged with employee survey data, we find strong evidence that opportunity costs to participate in the campaign and peer behavior in the firm matter to increase vaccination take-up. Contrary to the firm’s expectation, increased participation in the campaign did not imply reduced sickness absence during the flu season. As we observe no relevant health benefits or externalities via coworker vaccination, our comprehensive analyses indicate that the campaign most likely was not economically beneficial for the firm. We discuss potential explanations for this result and present evidence consistent with the notion that a vaccination campaign can influence the behavior of employees concerning their health.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04908 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document a pecking order of transaction costs in the interdealer market for German sovereign bonds, where three trading protocols coexist. Dealers can trade over the counter (OTC), either bilaterally or via brokers, as well as on an exchange. Trading on the exchange is more expensive than OTC, and broker-intermediated trades are more costly than bilateral OTC trades. The existence of an OTC discount is difficult to square with theories centered around search-and-bargaining frictions but is in line with models of hybrid markets based on information frictions. Consistently, we show that dealers’ information impacts their choice of trading protocol and that the pecking order of transaction costs is aligned with the informational content of order flows across protocols. Search and bargaining as well as information proxies explain differences in OTC discount within protocols. A realistic description of hybrid markets thus requires both types of frictions.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: L. Pelizzon and M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the influence of supply chains on the transmission of financial shocks to firms’ innovation. Using matched Italian firm-bank data over the 2007–2017 period, we find that firms’ engagement in supply chains enhanced the resilience of innovation activities to the banking shock caused by the “twin financial crises” (Great Financial Crisis and sovereign debt crisis). The results suggest that, amid the banking shock, supply chains facilitated purchases of innovative intermediates through trade credit provision and helped to sustain firms’ joint research and development efforts. The estimates imply, however, that the support offered by supply chains did not extend to radical product advances.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03601 .</content>

    <title>It's Not Just What You Say, but How You Say It: The Effects of Enterprise Social Media on Service Management, Through the Lens of Signaling Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Frontline service workers are crucial to service delivery and have been a long‐standing focus of research, with scholars and practitioners alike maintaining an interest in their effective management. As technology increasingly transforms this context, the way in which managers in service organizations communicate with frontline workers has also evolved, with a notable increase in the use of enterprise social media (ESM). This study investigates the idea that it is not just ‘what’ management says (service‐oriented messaging) but ‘the way’ they say it (via ESM) that matters. Drawing on interviews with 36 informants and guided by signaling theory, this study explores how ESM influences customer‐focused signaling via management communication and HR implementation in the frontline service context, fostering conditions for a service climate. Findings reveal that ESM's affordances can potentially enhance service climate by strengthening HR system strength, promoting voice, and fostering informal leadership. However, risks such as manager role ambiguity, perceptions of mixed messaging, and over‐surveillance are also identified. This study highlights the double‐edged implications of ESM in its shaping of service‐oriented signaling and emphasizes the importance of the signaling environment in realizing its benefits while mitigating its risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances real options reasoning (ROR) logics by examining how entrepreneurs make sequential decisions under varying uncertainty. Although ROR has been conceptualized as a useful decision-making framework, its boundary conditions and theoretical applications remain underspecified. Through a multistage experimental design with 181 entrepreneurs and an archival study, we demonstrate that entrepreneurs employ different ROR logics based on both the initial level of uncertainty and its subsequent directional changes. This advances ROR by establishing its boundary conditions, demonstrating when entrepreneurs do and do not employ ROR logics, and revealing how the directionality and magnitude of uncertainty changes influence entrepreneurial decision-making.</content>

    <title>Core or periphery: Examining where to allocate heterogeneous inventors and the impact on firms' innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms should allocate their inventors to network locations to achieve their best innovation performance. We use an NK model to model the interactions between key factors that influence a firm's innovation: (a) individuals' embeddedness within the firm's network, (b) individuals' heterogeneity across their search distance as well as their adoption (i.e., imitation) propensity, and (c) the complexity of the firm's landscape. We find that in high‐complexity landscapes, firms benefit from allocating low‐adopter agents to the core and high‐adopters to the periphery, thereby promoting more independent search at the core. The opposite is true for low complexity landscapes. We further find that when agent types are unknown, individuals should be allocated based on their adoption propensity versus search distance.Managerial SummaryWhere should firms locate their heterogeneous inventors within their networks? Simulating a complex innovation landscape, our study focuses on the interaction of three essential factors that may influence firms' innovation: the location of inventors in the core (embedded position) or periphery of a firm's structure, the distance inventors search for solutions, and the adoption propensity with which inventors will imitate their peers' solutions versus being independent and following their own trajectory. Our results show that firms benefit by placing independent searchers who also search far at the core of the firm when facing highly complex problems, and at the periphery otherwise. Though search distance and adoption propensity have substitutive effects on innovation performance, firms should allocate based on inventors' adoption propensity to lower innovation‐performance variance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study repurchase options (repo contracts) in a competitive asset market with adverse selection. Gains from trade emerge from a liquidity need, but private information about asset quality prevents the full realization of trades. In equilibrium, a single repo contract pools all assets. The embedded repurchase option mitigates adverse selection by improving the volume of trades relative to outright sales. However, liquidity provision can be inefficiently low as lenders compete to attract high-quality assets via high haircuts and low rates. The equilibrium has a closed form and aligns well with empirical patterns across Mortgage-Backed Securities repos.</content>

    <title>To Each Their Own: Personalized Product Offerings in Competition</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study competition between two firms that personalize product offerings to consumers. Firms have private, imperfect signals of each consumer’s ideal location and offer each consumer a different product without observing the competitor’s product offering. We characterize the equilibrium personalization strategy and examine how the accuracies of firms’ signals affect equilibrium strategy, profits, and consumer welfare. A firm generally charges a higher price for a more niche product and profits more from niche consumers unless its prediction accuracy is sufficiently lower than its competitor’s. When both firms have the same industry-level prediction accuracy, an increase in accuracy initially relaxes but later intensifies price competition for niche consumers, having the opposite effect on mainstream consumers. Interestingly, equilibrium profits also have an inverse-U shape in the prediction accuracy. A higher accuracy can also decrease welfare for mainstream consumers. When firms can endogenously invest in prediction accuracy, firms have incentives to overinvest in equilibrium, resulting in a prisoner’s dilemma. Privacy regulations that reduce predictive accuracy, including industry self-regulation, could improve profits and hurt consumer welfare by relaxing price competition. Our results remain robust under consumer search. The paper also discusses what happens if firms charge uniform pricing, if consumers’ ideal locations are distributed on the Salop circle, or if firms receive common signals, highlighting price discrimination between mainstream and niche consumers as the key driver of results.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce formal measures for two psychological factors of probabilistic risk attitudes: attractiveness (motivational factor) and discriminability (cognitive factor). Unlike previous approaches that relied on heuristic proxies, our measures precisely capture these two fundamental factors. Our measures are mathematically tractable, robust to discontinuities, such as in the NEO-additive case, and flexible to be applied to any weighting function, as well as to both small and large probabilities. Additionally, through detailed numerical analysis, we examine to what extent existing weighting function parameters capture the two factors: attractiveness and discriminability. Finally, using these new measures, we provide a formal understanding of the independence between motivational and cognitive factors.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The research was made possible by the financial support from Brazilian Agency of Research and Innovation (Finep), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [Grants PROJ–CAPES PRINT 1033427P] and PUC-Rio.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04870 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Limit orders submitted around the same time are subject to random latencies and will be queued accordingly. In equilibrium, end-of-queue limit orders always lose money—the liquidity supply appears excessive. The model generates empirical predictions regarding such “overshooting” liquidity: (i) new limit orders appear fleeting—clustered submissions are followed by immediate cancellations, (ii) the resulting cancel-to-add count ratio reflects adverse selection, and (iii) the cancel-to-add size ratio measures high-frequency market-making activity. Welfare can be hurt by the overshooting liquidity if it induces excessive speculation. Overall, the model contributes to a more comprehensive understanding and better utilization of order book data.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03371 .</content>

    <title>Addressing Gender in Authenticity and Inclusion at Work: Nuancing Conservation of Resources Theory With Social Role Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we elucidate how gender may influence the mechanisms and conditions under which perceived inclusion climate facilitates authenticity at work. We nuance conservation of resources theory with social role theory to argue that perceived inclusion climate acts as a caravan passageway through which authenticity at work can be fostered, yet how inclusion climate relates to authenticity is different for men versus for women. We hypothesize that men will feel more authentic when they perceive their organization to be inclusive because such perceptions enable them to feel unique, whereas women will feel more authentic when in inclusive organizations because such environments foster their belongingness. In a time‐lagged study, we find that for women, it is belongingness that is the mediating process, whereas for men, it is both uniqueness and belongingness. We additionally propose, and find, that structural empowerment, as an HRM contextual resource caravan, moderates the relationships between perceived inclusion climate and belongingness/uniqueness for women but not for men. Here, structural empowerment is particularly important for women's needs for belongingness and uniqueness when they perceive their organization be not very inclusive. Overall, we contribute to workplace inclusion and authenticity literatures by underscoring the need to consider gender differences in more depth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professional house price forecast data are consistent with a rational model where agents must learn about the parameters of the house price growth process and the underlying state of the housing market. Slow learning about the long-run mean generates overreaction to forecast revisions and a modest response of forecasts to lagged realizations. Heterogeneity in signals and priors about the long-run mean helps the model account for cross-sectional dispersion in forecasts. Introducing behavioral frictions helps improve the model’s predictions for short-horizon overreaction and dispersion. Using a cross-section of forecasters and a term structure of forecasts are crucial for inference. (JEL C32, D84, G41, R32)</content>

    <title>Status-Amplified Deterrence: Paul Manafort’s Prosecution Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents often struggle to deter organizational deviance. We propose a theory of “status-amplified deterrence” wherein enforcement’s deterrent effects are amplified when carried out against high-status organizational actors. First, this enforcement is interpreted as willingness and ability for far-reaching enforcement. Next, amplified deterrence occurs as these episodes become widely known through (1) extensive media coverage and (2) the marketing efforts of third-party compliance advisors. We examine this theory in the context of the U.S. Department of Justice’s enforcement against Paul Manafort for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that enforcement against Manafort caused a widespread, sustained, and economically significant reduction in FARA noncompliance. We show supplementary evidence consistent with the idea that deterrence was amplified in significant part by media attention and by law firms referencing the episode while successfully marketing FARA advisory services. We contribute to literature illuminating how organizations, in conjunction with third-party compliance advisors, adjust deviant activities in response to shifting regulatory environments.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18754 .</content>

    <title>Rethinking the Value and Emission Implications of Green Bonds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our analysis of green bonds issued between 2013 and 2022 reveals a distinctive shareholder preference for such assets, particularly among financial institutions. In the secondary market, the green bonds issued by financial firms’ trade at a “greenium” of 8.2 basis points compared with matched samples, which is attributed potentially to the financial firms’ efforts in channeling funds to green loans. Past work documenting a positive stock price reaction to the issuance of green bonds is isolated to financial firms and to specific issuers. Issuers of green bonds with higher emissions before the green bond issue report an insignificant reduction in such emissions after issuance. Our analysis of the sustainable lending practices of these gatekeepers reveals that the greenium earned in the green bond market does not translate to the green loan market. Furthermore, the borrowers’ performance remains unchanged in the short term, indicating a lack of due diligence by the gatekeepers. This study underscores the complex relationship between financial markets and environmental stewardship.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial assistance from Columbia Business School, Fordham University, Harvard University (Program on Corporate Governance), and MIT Sloan (Sustainability Initiative).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00961 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Comparative Analysis of FLE Wellness Benefits and Customer Responsiveness: A Social Exchange Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the importance of frontline employees (FLEs) for organizations and consumers, it is important to motivate them to achieve optimal performance. One way to motivate FLEs is through employer-provided wellness benefits, which might increase FLEs’ responsiveness to customer needs. Building on social exchange theory, this research simultaneously examines five different wellness benefits to identify factors that can enhance FLEs’ feelings of being valued and an induced sense of indebtedness, which in turn can have downstream effects on customer responsiveness. The results of five studies, including a pilot study, preliminary sales study, field studies, and an internal meta-analysis, demonstrate how food and social benefits exert the strongest effects, with food yielding stronger direct effects on customer responsiveness and both showing indirect effects through value and indebtedness feelings. The next strongest effects are from mindfulness benefits. Physical and health wellness benefits exert the weakest downstream consequences. Importantly, if FLEs are in a supportive work environment, the effects of food and social benefits are enhanced. Conversely, job stressors and motivational constructs do not significantly impact the effects of employer-provided wellness benefits. By adopting the provided recommendations, retailers and service providers can institute effective and optimal wellness programs to enhance their FLEs’ customer-facing behaviors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers demonstrate a preference for products with glossy surfaces. This research examines how and why product glossiness influences consumers’ product preference in the first-hand versus second-hand markets. Six studies demonstrate that consumers generally prefer products with a glossy, as opposed to a matte, surface in both first-hand and second-hand markets. The preference for product glossiness is driven by the heightened recency (pristineness) perception of glossy products in the first-hand (second-hand) market. In addition, in line with these mechanisms, the positive effect of product glossiness on consumer preference is reversed for time-enhanced products (i.e., product quality and value improve with age) in the first-hand market and diminished when diagnostic prior product usage information is available to consumers in the second-hand market. Findings in this research contribute to a deeper understanding of visual marketing and product newness by verifying how visual glossiness induces two different interpretations of product newness in the first-hand and second-hand markets. This research offers practical implications for product design and presentation in the first-hand market, as well as refurbishing and resale strategies in the second-hand market, suggesting ways to communicate a consistent brand image and enhance product preference more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how deskilling technology (map apps) affects the choice of individuals to provide ride‐hail service. In a vignette experiment, technology increased participation in work by 8% and 4% among low‐ and high‐skill drivers respectively. Technology can increase participation by raising productivity or affording an amenity (reducing disutility of work). A field experiment revealed that the technology afforded more amenity to low‐skill drivers and they incurred more stress when driving without technology. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce wage pressures.Managerial SummaryTechnologies that deskill work may afford an amenity by reducing the disutility of work. In formulating technology strategy, managers must consider how the amenity varies by worker skill and how it affects the supply of labor. In the context of ride‐hail drivers, we show that navigation technology affords an amenity. The amenity is larger and the effect of technology on increasing labor supply is more pronounced among drivers with less skill. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce pressures for higher wages from low‐skilled workers.</content>

    <title>On the Optimal Design of a Financial Stability Fund</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of a Financial Stability Fund (the “Fund” henceforth) for a union of sovereign countries. By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.</content>

    <title>Complementarity in Future Selves: How Networks of Future-Oriented Cognitive Representations Influence Individuals’ Ability to Proactively and Adaptively Manage Their Career</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When thinking about one’s future work life and career with its seemingly endless possibilities, individuals rarely have a singular “put together” vision of their future self, in which all components neatly fit together. We investigate how the complementarity of a future self impacts an individual’s efforts to work toward their desired future career. We conceptualize and operationalize a future self as a network of future-oriented cognitive representations and complementarity as the extent of mutually beneficial connections in this network. We propose that future self complementarity amplifies the energizing effect of activated future self representations as it spreads across the network, enhancing vitality, and thus promoting proactive career behavior. In Study 1, we developed and validated a network-based measure to capture future self complementarity. In Study 2, we found, in a temporally lagged sample of 517 employees at 11 organizations, an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior through vitality. Study 3, a preregistered causal chain experiment, provided further support for this link. In Study 4, a preregistered field experiment, we again found an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior, assessed using a scale as well as a behavioral measure, via vitality.Funding: Financial support from a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency as part of the “Investissements d’Avenir” program [ANR-16-IDEX-008]; a grant from the Community for Learning &amp; Innovation at Erasmus University Rotterdam; and by the ESSEC Research Center is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18204 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern tech platforms provide workers real-time control over when they work and, increasingly, flexible pay: the option to be paid immediately after work. We investigate the labor supply effects of pay flexibility and the implications of present-biased preferences among gig-economy workers. Using granular data from a nationwide randomized controlled trial at Uber, we estimate the effects of switching from a fixed weekly pay schedule to Instant Pay, a system that allows on-demand, within-day withdrawals. We find that flexible pay substantially increased drivers’ work time. Furthermore, consistent with present bias, the response is significantly higher when drivers are further away from the end of their counterfactual weekly pay cycle. We discuss welfare and broader implications in contexts in which workers have the ability to flexibly supply labor.This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05301 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For products developed through a collaboration of specialized groups, success requires craft and engineering ingenuity from designers who focus on specific attributes, coupled with synchronized coordination between various design groups. Although shared work experience in the team—or familiarity—can improve coordination, it can deter creativity. We empirically study the impact of team familiarity on market performance of products by focusing on product development in the video game industry by coupling a granular database of development credits with sales data for video games. Although familiarity among coordinators has a positive effect on performance, familiarity among designers has a negative effect. Further, the positive (negative) effect of familiarity among coordinators (designers) is present even if familiarity is built through roles other than coordination (design). Overall, team familiarity is associated with a decrease in the product's market performance. Our results suggest that infusing fluidity in design roles and maintaining stability in coordination roles could improve the performance of new products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Integrating the attention‐based view with the strategic leadership interfaces perspective, we propose a theoretical model of situational urgency mechanisms influencing the allocation of CEOs' attention towards responsive actions. Specifically, we theorize upon the role of humility, which leads CEOs towards embracing interfaces and makes them particularly attentive to the situational context in which they operate. We test our theorization by studying corporate venture capital investments in digital ventures as a response to the situational urgency for digital transformation originating from multiple levels of analysis, internal and external to the firm. Testing a sample of 362 CEOs from 191 firms and 35 industries, we find support for the importance of CEO humility and the moderating role of the lack of top management team digital experience (team‐level urgency) and emerging digital competition (industry‐level urgency). Our study provides important insights into CEO responsiveness and advances our understanding of situated attention through the theorization of situational urgency and its integration with the strategic leadership interfaces perspective.</content>

    <title>The Robin Hood Effect in Transgressions Against Firms: How Political Ideology Shapes Consumer Justifications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer transgressions against firms involve moral violations in which consumers take advantage of loopholes in companies’ return and satisfaction-guaranteed policies or the lack of strict enforcement against password sharing, piracy, shoplifting, wardrobing, coupon stacking, promotion abuse, and fraud. Drawing on the timeless tale of Robin Hood, the legendary outlaw who stands up against injustice, the authors demonstrate that consumers use a Robin Hood justification to legitimize their transgressions against firms. Building on moral foundations theory, this research demonstrates that political ideology impacts consumers’ transgression behavior and the perceived morality of these practices. Six studies show that under certain conditions in which the moral virtues of fairness and care are cued, liberals are more likely to engage in transgressions than conservatives. The studies further test factors that can intensify or mitigate consumer transgressions against firms. Findings from this research can help marketers better understand how consumers justify transgressions and how to effectively reduce these costly and pervasive behaviors.</content>

    <title>Can Legal and Professional Personnel Selection Principles be Met With Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence)?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The purpose of this article is primarily to evaluate whether machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) can meet scientific, professional, and legal principles of personnel selection based on the rapidly accumulating research literature in Human Resource Management (HRM). It does so by addressing a series of questions in terms of what is known in the current research literature on these principles and related topics and by proposing a research agenda for what else needs to be studied. The review shows that there is enough current scientific evidence on the value of ML to support its use. ML tools are able to meet the basic principles of personnel selection and better meet many other very important principles. In addition, ML for personnel selection decisions is not a “black box” and can be understood and explained. It does not increase the legal risks from hiring, although it may require some additional steps in a few jurisdictions. There are uses of ML in selection that most organizations should be considering. Customized procedures will require good data, but generic vendor products may also serve some needs. Additional expertise may be required of HRM professionals, but not necessarily at a high level that would require new staffing or consultant expense. The availability of large language models (LLMs) may render unproctored remote assessments vulnerable to cheating, and all narrative candidate information provided in the future susceptible to AI‐generated text, resulting in more questions than research answers at this stage. The article ends with practical and theoretical implications for the use of ML in selection.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from a Twitter-like investor social platform, we document evidence consistent with self-enhancing transmission bias. We find investors are more likely to post about their better-performing stocks. Their followers are more likely to buy the posted stocks than other non-posted stocks. The effect of the postings on follow-up purchases is consistent with an attention-based interpretation: the postings bring the discussed stocks into the followers’ choice set and increase their purchases. We also find that postings’ effect on follow-up purchases is related to postings’ perceived credibility. The performance-postings relationship is stronger among more volatile stocks and the relationship between postings and follow-up purchases is stronger among stocks with higher recent returns, shedding light on the spread of high-variance and extrapolative strategies. We also document that the social network features influential nodes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Investment Incentives and Relative Bargaining Power in a Multi-Product Distribution Channel</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Distribution channels featuring a common retailer that sells competing products and makes long-term, strategic investments are widespread. Within this context, we study retailer investments that have differential impacts on demand for competing products, which implies that the retailer might intentionally weaken a strong supplier’s bargaining position with its investment by helping a weak supplier’s product become more competitive in the consumer market. Our analyses show that the relative bargaining powers of suppliers who do not directly interact determine investment efficiency, product market shares, firm and channel profit, and consumer surplus. This is in contrast with single-supplier settings, where the supplier’s absolute bargaining power determines the retailer’s investment incentives and resulting outcomes. In further contrast to single-supplier models, we find that investment can be efficient (inefficient) when the investing retailer has limited (full) bargaining power, inefficiencies can manifest as under- or overinvestment, and a supplier benefits when competing suppliers have more bargaining power vis-a-vis the retailer. Our insights extend to supplier investments, product-specific investments, and repeated sequential investments and contribute to the ongoing discourse on channel management with multilateral bargaining, backward integration, dominant retailers and suppliers, and consumer surplus.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper introduces a novel two-beta currency pricing model, which decomposes the conventional dollar factor beta into a beta with risk-premium news and a beta with real-interest-rate news. These betas capture distinct features of currency returns and explain cross-sectional variations in currency risk premiums. The risk-premium beta is associated with an unconditionally positive price of risk, while the real-rate beta has an unconditionally negative price of risk due to precautionary savings. The prices of these beta risks exhibit conditional variations tied to economic conditions. Furthermore, the model explains the abnormal performance of various currency trading strategies.</content>

    <title>Dollar Dominance and The Transmission of Monetary Policy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Has the dominance of the dollar in global trade rendered monetary policy ineffective? An emerging view contends that if a country invoices its exports in dollars, exchange rates cannot stabilize economic activity, as the classical expenditure-switching channel is muted. This view rests on the premise that export prices are sticky in dollars, breaking the link between export demand and depreciations. But this assumption is not borne out by the data: goods priced in dollars tend to have more flexible prices, along with higher elasticities of substitution. We propose a model with more realistic assumptions and show that even with dollar pricing, depreciating the currency by loosening monetary policy can still boost exports and activity materially. The limit to any expansion is not demand, but supply capacity. We also show that low exchange-rate pass-through to dollar prices is not informative about price stickiness. The price response to exchange rates is small when demand elasticities are high, even with flexible prices: low pass-through is an equilibrium result, not evidence of a nominal friction.</content>

    <title>When Market Incompleteness Is Preferable to Market Power: Insights from Power Markets</title>
    <updated>2025-09-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the liberalization of power markets in Europe, almost all investments have required some form of subsidy, due in part to the incomplete nature of the market. In that respect, the literature has consistently shown the benefits of risk-sharing instruments to boost investments. Because of entry barriers, however, some producers today might find themselves in a dominant position. In “When market incompleteness is preferable to market power. Insights from power markets,” Ibrahim Abada and Andreas Ehrenmann investigate the impact of completing a market with financial contracts in the presence of market power. To do so, the authors formulate a set of stochastic equilibrium investment models of risk-averse agents with possibly two types of market failure: incompleteness and market power. They provide existence results and conduct a thorough numerical application inspired by the French case. Contrary to what is reported in the literature, the authors highlight conditions under which social welfare is worse off when partially completing the market with contracts in the presence of a price-making incumbent.</content>

    <title>Online Planning in Nonstationary Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A team of researchers, Cheung and Lyu, developed a new computational approach to tackle a central challenge in online planning: balancing real-time decisions with long-term performance in dynamic systems. Traditional solutions often rely on intractable dynamic programming, but the new method delivers near-optimal performance efficiently, even in nonstationary environments. The framework addresses a broad class of planning problems with concave objectives and convex constraints, applicable to real-world scenarios like coupon assignment, order fulfillment, and resource allocation. The study considers two decision-making settings: one with unlimited access to data samples via simulations and another with finite sample data. By leveraging gradient-based insights from offline simulations, the researchers propose an offline-to-online framework that performs well in both settings. Notably, in the sampling setting, the approach improves as more data or longer planning horizons become available. Numerical tests on coupon assignment and supply chain management problems show significant gains over existing methods.</content>

    <title>Sequential Decision Making: From Decision Elicitation to Strategy Identification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Characterizing behavior in sequential problems is often complicated by the presence of multiple decision rules with overlapping predictions. To address this issue, we introduce a new experimental and econometric approach for identifying decision strategies in sequential contexts. This approach consists of eliciting conditional strategies (as opposed to direct choices) and measuring policy adherence via maximum-likelihood estimation (as opposed to counting coincidences). Applying this approach to several common types of sequential problems increases the proportion of uniquely identifiable subjects by up to a third relative to standard methods and yields the following findings. First, in search and stopping problems, decision makers respond less strongly to state and time of the dynamic problem than in problems that do not have a stopping structure. Second, decision rules are often biased toward being more accepting (less demanding) than the optimal policy would predict. Third, the format used to elicit decisions (menu-based choice versus numeric threshold entry) has a significant effect on policy adoption. In addition to identifying decision rules that better fit observed behavior in dynamic choice problems, these results have implications for firms serving customers who face sequential decisions. We use a revenue management example (optimal subscription service pricing) to show that failing to account for the relevant decision rules can reduce firm profits by up to 54%.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02381 .</content>

    <title>Efficient Switchback Experiments with Surrogate Variables: Estimation and Experimental Design</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Switchback experiments, in which experimental units are assigned to control and treatment interchangeably over time, have gained increasing popularity in recent years due to their ability to mitigate interference across units. Despite their wide adoption in the technology sector, drawing reliable inferences from such experiments remains challenging due to temporal interference. In this paper, we address this challenge by examining a special causal structure commonly found in a wide range of applications. Specifically, we consider scenarios where there exist surrogate variables at each experimental period that can fully capture the potential temporal interference from the past. We outline the necessary assumptions for identification in this context and propose an unbiased estimator using the technique of importance sampling. Additionally, we derive an experimental design with a near-optimal worst-case guarantee and compare it theoretically and empirically to the inverse propensity score estimator. To facilitate inferences, we introduce both an exact inference procedure based on Fisher’s randomization test and an asymptotic inference procedure based on the central limit theorem. We demonstrate by extensive numerical experiments that the proposed estimator, coupled with the experimental design, results in lower risk compared with the traditional inverse propensity score estimator.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Anticompetitive Effects of a Dominant Retailer’s Guaranteed Profit Margin and Low-Price Contracts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A retailer can insist on a guaranteed margin contract with its supplier, wherein it requires a margin on each sale. In addition, it may want to have the lowest selling price in a market with competing retailers, and if this strategy of offering the lowest price reduces its margin, the supplier must pay up the difference. There has been recent debate on whether this approach leads to anticompetitive behavior with elevated retail prices, monopolistic market, or diminished market coverage. We analyze a game-theoretic model involving a supplier and two retailers where the focal retailer adopts either the guaranteed margin contract or the guaranteed margin contract with lowest price guarantee. We show that when product category competition is intense, the guaranteed margin contract is anticompetitive: The supplier forms an exclusive distribution with the focal retailer leading to higher prices and reduced product access in comparison with when they both adopt a wholesale price contract. However, if the intensity of competition is low, consumers benefit by paying lower prices with wider access as long as the supplier sets identical wholesale prices, but prices remain higher when they set differentiated wholesale prices. The guaranteed margin contract with lowest price guarantee, however, always leads to higher prices by dampening competition. As such, the ability of the focal retailer to choose the contract type and the intensity of product category competition leads to outcomes that can either benefit or hurt consumers. Our results help inform policy makers on the necessary interventions to alleviate anticompetitiveness.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: A.

    <title>How Does Going Public Affect Employee Satisfaction? Evidence from Glassdoor Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how initial public offerings (IPOs) influence employees’ satisfaction with their employers. Using millions of company reviews and a generalized difference-in-differences method, we document that employees become less satisfied after their employers go public. The effect is driven by employees who joined the company before the IPO rather than those who joined after it and is stronger for employees whose tasks relate to regulatory compliance, for smaller firms, and firms with Big 4 auditors at the IPO. The effect is weaker for IPO firms in industries with low environmental, social, and governance (especially social) reputation risk. Using the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to explore changes in regulatory burdens associated with an IPO, we find that the adverse effect of an IPO on employee satisfaction is weaker for IPO firms that benefit from reduced regulatory burden. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into how going public can affect employee welfare and one potential mechanism behind this effect.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04285 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHospital-affiliated online health communities (OHCs) offer a powerful tool to enhance off-line care quality and promote health equity. This study reveals that, when physicians participate in OHCs, their patients experience a 3.87% reduction in mortality risk and a 4.63% increase in recovery rates. A key mechanism is the improvement in care continuity—better care coordination and stronger patient–provider relationships—facilitated by online interactions. Crucially, these benefits are significantly more pronounced for patients with low socioeconomic status, demonstrating OHCs’ potential to reduce healthcare disparities. To maximize impact, healthcare providers should actively encourage physician engagement in OHCs, integrate these platforms with existing health records, and promote their use among disadvantaged populations. Policymakers can leverage OHCs as a strategic tool to advance equitable, high-quality care.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly 400,000 Black men were drafted into the National Army during World War I, where they toiled primarily as menial laborers in segregated units. Leveraging novel variation from the WWI draft lottery and millions of digitized military and NAACP records, we document the pioneering role these men played in the early civil rights movement. Relative to observably similar individuals from the same draft board, Black men randomly inducted into the Army were significantly more likely to join the nascent NAACP and to become prominent community leaders in the New Negro era. We find little evidence that these effects are explained by migration or improved socioeconomic status. Rather, corroborating historical accounts about the catalyzing influence of institutional racism in the military, we show that increased civic activism was driven by soldiers who experienced the most discriminatory treatment while serving their country.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Secrecy is critical for knowledge protection during innovation, but it can hinder knowledge creation. Despite considerable research into when and why organizations employ secrecy, our understanding of how secrecy is managed during the research and development (R&amp;D) process remains limited. I examine how secrecy emerges, manifests, and evolves across the R&amp;D process through a historical case study of the making of the atomic bomb in the United States during World War II. I uncover a model of adaptive secrecy, whereby practices of knowledge sharing and concealment evolve with changing tensions between knowledge creation and protection. Adaptive secrecy practices give rise to different types of uncertainty (evaluative, boundary, and performance) that are navigated through three types of adaptive disclosures: revealed concealment, revealing meta-information, and revealing contextual information. Through this process, organizations develop complex, multilayered secrecy structures with in-groups, out-groups, and in-between groups. I articulate feedback relationships between elements of the adaptive secrecy model and establish boundary conditions pointing to research directions on variants of this process. This study contributes a dynamic, microfoundational view of secretive innovation, develops the notion of out-groups and in-between groups within organizations, and advances the idea of meta-knowledge sharing in collaborative work.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17687 .</content>

    <title>Margin or Mission? Understanding the Relationship Between Multilevel Functional Subgroups and Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study extends the behavioral theory of the firm by examining how functional subgroups within organizations influence strategic decision-making differentially across hierarchical levels. We argue that a larger proportion of managers in a specific functional subgroup within an executive team causes this group to focus the organization’s strategic agenda on those issues that this functional subgroup considers most important. However, within a functional subgroup, the issues to which managers pay attention can vary between hierarchical levels, with senior managers’ attention shaped by higher-level strategic schema, and lower-level managers’ attention shaped by local, more operational stimuli. We test our theory using data from 1,064 U.S. hospitals, 6,218 executives, and Medicare-adjusted pricing for hospitals’ shoppable services. Our analysis focuses on two key functional subgroups: the revenue subgroup, which focuses on financial sustainability, and the medical mission subgroup, focused on quality and accessible healthcare. We find that a higher proportion of revenue-focused managers at the system level is associated with higher insured pricing. In comparison, a higher proportion of system-level medical mission managers is associated with lower pricing. Interestingly, at the hospital level, a greater proportion of medical mission managers correlates with higher insured pricing, likely reflecting efforts to secure additional resources. Posthoc analyses further clarify the mechanisms behind these relationships. Our results highlight that functional subgroups are not monolithic; their managers’ perspectives can vary with their relative position in the organizational hierarchy, and this can provide an important mechanism of conflict resolution.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the recent Basel Accords, the Expected Shortfall (ES) replaces the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the standard risk measure for market risk in the banking sector, making it the most important risk measure in financial regulation. One of the most challenging tasks in risk modeling practice is to backtest ES forecasts provided by financial institutions. To design a model-free backtesting procedure for ES, we make use of the recently developed techniques of e-values and e-processes. Backtest e-statistics are introduced to formulate e-processes for risk measure forecasts, and unique forms of backtest e-statistics for VaR and ES are characterized using recent results on identification functions. For a given backtest e-statistic, a few criteria for optimally constructing the e-processes are studied. The proposed method can be naturally applied to many other risk measures and statistical quantities. We conduct extensive simulation studies and data analysis to illustrate the advantages of the model-free backtesting method, and compare it with the ones in the literature.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: R.

    <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Application Costs for Managing Congestion in Online Matching Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Matching platforms seek to facilitate market clearing, but congestion arises with imbalances in supply and demand. In online labor markets, when workers can apply to jobs without restriction, they may apply to an excessive volume of positions to maximize their likelihood of securing work, overwhelming employers and making screening difficult if not altogether unmanageable. Prior research has theoretically argued that imposing application costs on workers can mitigate this issue. However, the efficacy of such a solution has yet to be evaluated empirically in matching platforms where employers incur significant screening costs. We address that gap here, considering a prominent online labor market that imposed application costs on workers. We report evidence that application costs successfully improved matching outcomes via at least two channels. First, the application costs reduced bid volumes, lowering employer screening costs in turn. Second, the application costs led workers to become more selective in their applications, focusing on the employers and jobs that they were best suited for and putting greater effort into differentiating themselves, including actively reaching out to employers via direct messages. These worker-side, secondary responses enhance the first-order benefit of the application costs (i.e., constraining application volumes). Finally, the workers’ increased selectivity comes paired with risk aversion among workers, who become more likely to apply for jobs requiring familiar skills and less likely to apply for jobs posted by employers in different time zones or speaking a different language. We discuss the implications of our findings for workers’ longer-term career trajectories and market sustainability generally.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>The Interplay Between Product Variety and Customer Retention: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The optimal number of products to offer consumers is one of the core strategic problems that firms face. This is increasingly so in digital markets where many firms offer a large product variety. In these markets, consumers purchase products repeatedly, making customer retention an important aspect for firm performance. In this paper, we study the interplay between these two variables, product variety and customer retention. First, we provide a novel game-theoretic model to analyze this interplay and also determine how the optimal product variety depends on the market environment. Second, we provide suggestive evidence for our theoretical predictions using data for video games from Steam. Our data set allows us to measure the key variables in our game-theoretic model and additionally contains plausible instrumental variables for empirical identification. We show theoretically that investment in product portfolio size and investment in customer retention are substitutes because the former increases demand from switching consumers, whereas the latter increases the repurchase probability of current consumers. We then derive predictions on how market conditions determine a firm’s product variety, for which we find evidence in our empirical analyses: there is (i) a negative relation between product portfolio size and customer retention, (ii) an inverted U-shaped relationship between market value and product variety, and (iii) a positive relation between consumer heterogeneity and product variety. Both our theoretical and empirical results are robust to a wide set of robustness checks.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Grant 462020252].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00985 .</content>

    <title>All for one or one for all? How power states affect consumer giving across charities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Though ample research on consumer giving exists, it has typically focused on factors affecting donation depth, or how much a consumer donatesto one charity. Much less research has focused on factors affecting donation breadth, or how a consumer distributes donationsacross multiple charities. To address this void, the current research offers eight studies examining how donation breadth may be affected by the level of power consumers experience. A core finding is that low‐ (vs. high‐) power states lead to greater donation breadth. This effect arises through a novel mechanism by which low‐ (vs. high‐) power states promote more refined categorizations that help consumers discern cross‐charity differences to increase donation breadth. Convergent evidence of this categorization‐based mechanism is provided by causal chain, measurement‐based, and moderation approaches. The impact of this research on the prosocial behavior and consumer power literature is discussed, as are implications for organizations seeking to strategically manage consumer giving in the context of multiple charities.</content>

    <title>CEO Human Capital and Digital Product Innovation: A Dynamic Managerial Capabilities Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHow does the human capital of chief executive officers (CEOs) drive digital product innovation in manufacturing firms? Analyzing data from 216 U.S. firms and over 8,000 new product announcements, this study shows that technological and business knowledge can both enable and inhibit digital product innovation, depending on the external environment. In stable settings, tech-savvy CEOs drive digital product innovation, whereas business-savvy CEOs focus elsewhere. In dynamic environments, these effects reverse. These findings offer a contextual view on the ongoing debate about the value of technological versus business expertise in top management, suggesting that neither type of knowledge is universally beneficial. We also find that CEOs serve as distinct innovation catalysts beyond their top management teams. Follow-up interviews reveal the diverse strategies they use to initiate, develop, and implement digital product innovation in established firms. Based on these findings, the study offers guidance for boards of directors on aligning CEO selection with environmental demands and for CEOs seeking to expand their knowledge base to more effectively foster digital product innovation under varying conditions.</content>

    <title>Quality Control for Crowd Workers and for Language Models: A Framework for Free-Text Response Evaluation with No Ground Truth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As businesses increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as customer service and information retrieval, ensuring the accuracy of their responses is a critical challenge. Traditional verification is costly, slow, and often requires scarce domain experts. We introduce the automated quality evaluation based on textual responses (AQER) framework, a novel, cost-effective method to assess the correctness of free-text answers from both LLMs and human workers without needing preexisting correct answers. AQER works by intelligently aggregating multiple responses to the same question, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to create a reliable synthetic correct answer, followed by an iterative procedure that accounts for response quality cues. AQER obtains state-of-the-art performance compared with existing automated response evaluation baselines. For managers AQER offers a scalable, data-driven method to (i) evaluate and select the best performing LLMs for specific organizational needs and use cases, (ii) continuously monitor artificial intelligence (AI) performance to ensure reliability and accountability across different model versions, and (iii) manage the quality of crowd workers essential for high-quality AI training and validation. AQER, thus, offers a robust mechanism for improving model performance and mitigating the significant financial and reputational risks associated with deploying untrustworthy generative AI technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how the emergence of digital distribution platforms (DDPs), platforms that facilitate transactions between consumers and incumbents, affects industry structure and competition. Studying the effect of delivery platforms on restaurants in the United States from 2012 to 2018, we show that DDP emergence increases exit and concentration and reduces business dynamism. We provide speculative evidence that these changes are driven by both an increase in inter‐firm competition as well as increased margin pressure from the platform. We show that strategic positioning shapes how establishments experience such changes to competition and that DDP emergence can cause a revaluation of resources within an establishment's business model. This research documents how technology‐enabled intermediaries can disrupt an industry by altering the basis of competition.Managerial AbstractThe emergence of platforms like Grubhub or Instacart that connect consumers to existing incumbent establishments can alter industry structure and within‐industry competition. We study the effect of delivery platforms on restaurants in the United States and show that the emergence of such platforms has increased exit and concentration within the restaurant industry. We present suggestive evidence that these changes are driven by intensified inter‐firm competition and increased margin pressure from the platforms. We then explore which restaurants are better able to weather the emergence of delivery platforms, showing that establishments' strategic positioning and prior investments shape the extent to which delivery platform penetration is beneficial versus detrimental. Through this research, we document how digital distribution platforms can reshape competition within an industry.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulatory concerns over a tension between expanding financial access and limiting default have led to significant restrictions on contract terms in a number of countries, despite limited evidence on their effectiveness. We use a large nation-wide RCT to examine new borrower responses to changes in interest rates and minimum payments for a credit card that accounted for 15% of all first-time formal loans in Mexico. Default rates were 19% over the 26 month experiment and a 30 pp decrease in interest rates decreased default by 2.5 pp with no effects on the newest borrowers. Doubling minimum payments increased default by 0.8 pp during the experiment but reduced it by 1 pp afterwards, possibly by reducing debt. Matching the experimental sample to their formal employment histories we find that the effect of job separation—more common among new borrowers—on default is seven times larger than the effect of the 30 pp interest rate change. We provide a simple framework for interpreting the experimental results, and rationalize the smaller contract term effects by their limited effects on cash flow rather than by differences in per-peso impacts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model a fishery with potential congestion, in which firms obtain public and private signals about the location of the densest fish stock. We analytically determine the regions of parameter space where greater precision of public and/or private information increases welfare, and we examine the effects of two types of information sharing. Using high-resolution data from the world’s largest fishery, we estimate the structural model. Point estimates imply that more precise private information raises welfare, whereas more precise public information has a negligible effect on welfare. Moreover, welfare is much more sensitive to changes in the precision of private information than to changes in the precision of public information. This difference reflects the fact that public information increases congestion more than private information does. We also find empirically that a small amount of information sharing can reduce welfare, whereas more extensive information sharing raises welfare, as do information clubs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the adoption of electric vehicles emerges a need for coordinated charging strategies to cater to the increased and often synchronized energy demand without violating physical infrastructure limits. Common charging strategies repeatedly solve a corresponding offline problem. In “Relating Electric Vehicle Charging to Speed Scaling with Job-Specific Speed Limits,” Winschermann, Antoniadis, Gerards, Hoogsteen, and Hurink thoroughly analyze that offline problem and present the flow-based offline charging scheduler (FOCS), an algorithm that solves the problem to optimality. The authors continue to quantify the approximation ratio of repeatedly solving the offline problem throughout the day as opposed to solving the offline problem with a priori knowledge of future arrivals. Numerical experiments confirmed that the found worst-case approximation ratio of 4 is far from the achieved empirical ratio of 1.3 when evaluating the ratio for real-world electric vehicle charging instances. Experiments based on that same real-world data show that FOCS only takes seconds to schedule 400 EVs in 15-minute granularity, which is competitive with commercial solvers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fairness in Online Selection ProblemsTwo of the most studied models in online decision making are the secretary problem and the prophet inequality problem. Both capture the challenge of making irrevocable choices under uncertainty. But, what happens when candidates come from different groups and fairness enters the picture? In “Fairness and bias in online selection,” José Correa, Andrés Cristi, Paul Dütting, and Ashkan Norouzi-Fard introduce and analyze multicolor variants of these problems. In these models, each candidate belongs to a “color,” and comparisons are only meaningful within the same color. This captures real-world situations where crossgroup rankings are unreliable or biased—for instance, when evaluating students from different schools or job applicants from diverse backgrounds. For the multicolor secretary problem, the authors characterize the optimal online algorithm. In contrast to the offline optimum—which always selects from the most promising group—the optimal online algorithm is inherently fairer. For the multicolor prophet inequality, they design algorithms that enforce target selection probabilities across groups, ensuring equitable treatment.</content>

    <title>The Check Is in the Mail: Can Disclosure Reduce Late Payments to Suppliers?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether buyers reduce their late payments in response to a regulatory change in the United Kingdom that mandates the public disclosure of their payment practices. We find that UK buyers subject to this regulation reduce their late payments. In cross-sectional tests, we find that this reduction in late payments is more pronounced for buyers with a greater extent of late payments, buyers facing a more concentrated supplier base, and buyer-supplier relationships in which a supplier is more important to a buyer than other suppliers. In additional tests, we document evidence consistent with increases in contracting costs for late payers after the disclosure of late payments. Specifically, we find that late-paying buyers experience (i) a loss of suppliers and (ii) a negative stock market reaction. Finally, for buyers subject to the regulation, we document a decrease in operating cash flows, increase in debt, decrease in investment, and decrease in future profitability. Our findings that the disclosure of late payments contains decision-useful information can inform standard-setters, as the FASB and IASB recently mandated new disclosures related to trade credit but omitted mandates for disclosures related to late payments.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06586 .</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present two findings on how environmental policy uncertainty impacts municipal bond returns. First, yields increase after a new pollution standard is proposed but decrease after this standard is finalized. Second, after annual announcements of compliance status, yields fall for counties that remain in compliance but increase for newly noncompliant counties. We present suggestive evidence linking these short-run municipal bond market reactions to long-run changes in pollution and housing prices. Our findings suggest that increases in either regulatory stringency or uncertainty over future environmental policy increase the cost of municipal debt raised to fund schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02340 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Relative performance evaluation has become an increasingly common component of executive compensation contracts. We study how these incentive plans relate to corporate disclosure and predict that they introduce an incremental disclosure cost. This cost arises because disclosures can help competitors make better investment decisions, enhancing their performance and thereby reducing managers’ expected compensation. Consistent with this prediction, we find a negative association between relative performance plans and voluntary value-relevant management forecasts, alongside a positive association with redactions in mandatory filings. This pattern is specific to plans with accounting-based metrics and absent for plans with price-based metrics. The results for price-based metrics are consistent with the idea that the incentive to reduce information asymmetry with market participants outweighs disclosure costs in these plans. The results for accounting-based metrics are more pronounced for managers whose plans provide stronger incentives and for those whose forecasts provide meaningful information spillovers to peers. Overall, this paper contributes the idea that relative performance plans can impose disclosure costs, thereby shedding light on contracting mechanisms that discourage disclosure—a less well-understood aspect of disclosure research.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06200 .</content>

    <title>Base Rate Neglect as a Source of Inaccurate Statistical Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical discrimination relies on people inferring unobservable characteristics of group members based on their beliefs about the group. Across four preregistered experiments (N = 9,002), we show that accurate information about the composition of top performers can induce incorrect beliefs about performance differences across groups when the groups are of unequal size. Because people fail to account for base rates, they underestimate the performance of individuals from smaller groups. As a result, when participants in our experiments receive true information about the gender composition of top performers in a male-dominated candidate pool, they are less likely to hire women, even when there are no gender differences in performance (Study 1). Similarly, they are less likely to hire better-performing non-White candidates when the racial demographics of the candidate pool reflect the U.S. population (Study 4). We show that these choices reflect an error in statistical reasoning, rather than being motivated by a desire to discriminate against any particular group (Study 2). Despite leading to less accurate beliefs, participants disproportionately seek out information about top performers when given the choice, and discrimination thus persists when information selection is endogenous (Study 3).This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00603 .</content>

    <title>On Telemedicine Reimbursements and Hospital Adoption: A Policy Analysis Using Causal Inference Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There continue to be substantial differences in the quality and access to healthcare available to communities across the United States. Researchers have called this the healthcare divide. Telemedicine, a technology‐mediated intervention that promises to bridge this healthcare divide, has been discussed by some as the great leveler. Policymakers, therefore, continue creating legislation that may drive hospitals to adopt telemedicine. Yet, how (or whether) such legislation achieves the goal of telemedicine adoption (and relatedly, healthcare divide reduction) is unclear. In the current study, we investigate a phased introduction of telemedicine reimbursement policies across various states in the United States between 2014 and 2019 to explore the causal effects of such policies on hospital adoption of telemedicine. Results suggest that while reimbursement policies drove the adoption of telemedicine services, this adoption was restricted to inpatient services rather than outpatient ones. We ground our investigation on extant theoretical insights from institutional isomorphism and highlight the limitations in our understanding of the adoption of telemedicine by hospitals in the country.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Buyer's Incentives and Organizational Structure on Suppliers' Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Changes in a buyer organization's incentives and structure can have a significant impact on supply chain performance, such as the quality of sourced components. We examine this relationship using data from a unique quasi‐experiment where one of the two plants of a buyer introduced long‐term quality improvement incentives and a more organic structure for supply chain engineers, while the other plant did not. Analyzing longitudinal component quality data from suppliers to both plants using difference‐in‐differences and triple‐differences methods, we find that (i) the changes in incentives and structure led to differential improvements in supplier quality across the two plants, and (ii) suppliers did not easily transfer quality knowledge gained from one buyer relationship to others. Our paper contributes by showing that organizational redesign by a buyer focused on implicit incentives along with a supportive organic organizational structure can create a learning environment at its suppliers that can help improve the quality of sourced components and the learning generated does not necessarily spill over to other buyers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how tracking the running times of durable medical equipment connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to estimate the demand for MRO products and consumable supplies (MRO &amp; CS) and lessen the Bullwhip Effect in healthcare supply chains (HSCs). By analyzing a unique data set consisting of orders for medical supplies in a multi‐echelon HSC spanning 12 quarters (3 years), using two‐stage econometric modeling and counterfactual analysis methods, we find that the sharing of these usage and consumption signals significantly improves forecast accuracy, lowers order size, and reduces the bullwhip effects of MRO &amp; CS. We find that the supply chain benefits of tracking equipment running time are amplified by the scope of the relational exchanges between supply chain partners. We analyze the two dominant IoT networking paradigms—Edge and cloud IoT—and find that the benefits of signal sharing are significantly higher under the Edge IoT network. We also find that the tracking of medical equipment has second‐order effects that extend to products whose consumption is correlated with the tracked products. Our research makes important theoretical contributions to the HSC and technology management literatures and provides valuable insights into how emergent technologies can be used to address the distinctive challenges of healthcare supply chains.</content>

    <title>Examining the Impact of Generative AI on Users’ Voluntary Knowledge Contribution: Evidence from A Natural Experiment on Stack Overflow</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice and policy abstractGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping online knowledge-sharing, but its effects on voluntary user contributions remain uncertain. This study examines how the usage of ChatGPT influences users’ answering behavior on Stack Overflow, one of the world’s largest question-and-answer platforms. Using a natural experiment, we find that access to generative AI increases the number of answers users provide, whereas those answers are typically shorter and easier to read. These patterns suggest that users are learning from AI outputs, enabling them to share knowledge more efficiently. However, intensive reliance on AI introduces cognitive strain, which can reduce contribution levels. For practice, our findings underscore the importance for platform owners and managers to strike a balance between AI integration and user support. Encouraging AI-assisted learning can expand participation and improve the accessibility of content, but safeguards are necessary to prevent cognitive overload and ensure the quality of answers. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of establishing clear guidelines for the responsible use of AI in community-driven platforms. By designing thoughtful integration strategies, organizations can harness the benefits of AI—enhancing efficiency and readability—while sustaining authentic, high-quality knowledge contributions.</content>

    <title>Willingness to Pay for Carbon Mitigation: Field Evidence from the Market for Carbon Offsets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) for carbon mitigation from demand for carbon offsets in a field experiment with an online supermarket. The experiment randomizes whether the firm subsidizes the price of the offset or matches the offset’s impact on carbon mitigation. Consumers are price-elastic but fully impact-inelastic, implying that they buy the offset but their WTP for the carbon it mitigates is zero. If the firm informs consumers that it contributes to the offset costs, WTP increases to 16 EUR/tCO2. A complementary survey shows that consumers’ stated WTP is 238 EUR/tCO2, far above their revealed preferences. (JEL D61, D82, H21, Q50, Q58)</content>

    <title>Policy Diffusion and Polarization across U.S. States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists have studied the impact of numerous state laws, from welfare rules to voting ID requirements. Yet for all this policy evaluation, what do we know about policy diffusion—how these policies are introduced and spread from state to state? We present a series of facts based on a data set of 602 U.S. state policies spanning the past seven decades. First, proxies of state capacity do not predict a higher likelihood of innovating new policies, but the political leaning of the state does predict a higher likelihood of introducing partisan laws since 1990. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity—a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so—as well as similarity in voter policy preferences. Third, since 2000, party alignment has become the strongest predictor of diffusion, and the speed of adoption has increased. Models of learning and correlated preferences can account for the earlier patterns, but the findings for the last two decades indicate a sharply increasing role of party control. We conclude that party polarization has emerged as a key factor recently for policy adoption, plausibly leading to a worse match between state policies and voter preferences.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Hybrid Fleet Management and Vehicle Repositioning in Mobility-as-a-service Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms have revolutionized urban transportation and fundamentally transformed travelers’ experience and engagement, they encounter a significant challenge in maintaining a temporal and spatial balance between supply and demand, particularly with the inclusion of crowd-sourced freelance drivers. In this study, we propose a hybrid supply-side management problem that accounts for heterogeneous revenue dependent on surge pricing, where surge pricing not only determines per-trip earnings but also influences demand elasticity and overall revenue generation. This problem combines the physical repositioning of in-house vehicles with an incentivedriven approach (surge pricing in crowd-sourcing) for freelance vehicles. A multinomial logit (MNL) model is employed to model the repositioning behavior of crowd-sourced drivers, and reformulated as a low-level equilibrium problem embedded in a bi-level program. To characterize the surge price-dependent uncertain demand, a tailored residual-based Wasserstein ambiguity set is constructed within the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. Notably, the proposed residual-based Wasserstein DRO model is demonstrated to satisfy both finite sample guarantee and asymptotic optimality. A linear decision rule (LDR) approximation facilitates a tractable reformulation, and it is shown to incur no loss of optimality for the single-period case. We validate the practical applicability of our model using a dataset from RideAustin, a ride-hailing platform operating in Austin, Texas. We find that the hybrid fleet approach gets the best of both worlds by increasing average revenue using crowd-sourced vehicles and enhancing system robustness using in-house vehicles. Interestingly, we show that a “sweet-spot” may exist as an optimal ratio between the number of in-house and crowd-sourced vehicles that maximizes the overall revenue.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Knowledge Outsourcing from a Consultant: Implications of Absorptive Capacity and Knowledge Reuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a client who has a problem she cannot solve by a given due date, and a consultant engaged to help. The consultant sets the price for knowledge outsourcing to maximize his profit. The client sets the quantity of knowledge outsourcing and the portion of the problem she solves in-house to minimize her cost. The client benefits from knowledge outsourcing only to the extent that she has absorptive capacity to understand and utilize that knowledge. In this context, absorptive capacity is driven by the client’s relevant knowledge and the working relationship between the client and the consultant. We examine how absorptive capacity impacts the key operational decisions of both the client and the consultant. Motivated by the experience of one of the co-authors, we introduce a deterministic model and two stochastic extensions that are critical in industries including semiconductor manufacturing. While we find that more absorptive capacity always reduces the client’s total cost; under certain conditions, the consultant’s profit may deteriorate. If project scope uncertainty exists, we find that, in some competitive environments, the availability of an outsourcing option can indirectly incentivize a client to take on more risk. If project completion time uncertainty exists, we show that a client employs a more experienced consultant and forgoes control of the project to lower her expected total cost. Surprisingly, in a time-based competitive environment, the more experienced consultant increases his price; whereas if time-based competition is limited, the consultant’s price is lower. Lastly, extensive numerical experiments are developed based on the synthesis of the deterministic and the two stochastic models. The numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of the analytical results. Additionally, numerical results are obtained whereby, prior to the start of the game: (i) the client may invest to increase her initial knowledge or (ii) the client and the consultant may invest to improve their working relationship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of late penalties in reducing patient tardiness. Specifically, we evaluate two types of penalties: the last-place penalty (i.e., assigning late-arriving patients to the end of the queue) and the fixed-place penalty (i.e., moving late patients back by a fixed number of positions), under two conditions—absence of a time recommendation and presence of an explicit time recommendation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 9,573 patient visits at a partner hospital in Asia. Our findings indicate that the fixed-place penalty has no significant impact on patient tardiness. In contrast, the last-place penalty significantly reduces patients’ late rate and encourages earlier arrival, particularly when no time recommendation is provided. When combined with a time recommendation, the last-place penalty continues to lower the late rate but does not further shift arrival times earlier. We also find that the lastplace penalty is effective in increasing the patient’s compliance with the time recommendation. We further implemented the last-place penalty in the partner hospital across a broader dataset involving 61,829 visits, yielding consistent results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ privacy choice between withholding and sharing personal data may change during crises. Crises not only alter personal considerations of benefits and costs of this choice, but also trigger societal considerations, such as use of shared data in crisis management. Although the literature on privacy choice has focused on personal considerations, research on how this choice is influenced by broader circumstances remains sparse. We address this topic by leveraging newly available location big data and a global public health crisis as a natural shock. Analyzing 22 billion raw records of intertemporal individual-level mobile location data across a wide spectrum of cities in the United States, we present the first large-scale evidence that opt-out reduces during a crisis, and societal, beyond personal, considerations might have influenced consumers’ privacy choices.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00017 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Auditor Reputation in an Emerging Audit Marketplace: Evidence from Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the role of auditor reputation in driving the value of smart contract audits (SCAs) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Given the lack of regulatory oversight and the risk of cybersecurity breaches against the protocols comprising the DeFi ecosystem, a marketplace has emerged for voluntary on-demand assurance to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts’ coded logic. After documenting that market participants value SCAs and exploring the protocol attributes associated with the demand for smart contract audits, we show that auditor reputation can be established through both advertising (i.e., engagement on Twitter) and the delivery of a high-quality audit, which significantly shape the extent to which an SCA is valued. Additional analyses suggest that the value of an SCA is maximized when both high advertising and high audit quality are present, highlighting the complementary role of these two factors in enhancing auditor reputation. Furthermore, we find that events conceivably damaging the reputation of the auditor (i.e., breaches of protocols recently audited) generate a negative spillover to the auditor’s other recent clients. Overall, our study provides novel insights about the role of auditor reputation in emerging audit markets.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02245 .</content>

    <title>The Dual Brokerage Role of Digital Platforms in the Transition to a Circular Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transition to a circular economy hinges on effective brokerage—the work of intermediaries in connecting innovative closed‐loop recyclers (the niche) with the established waste network (the regime). While brokerage theory and its classicaltertius iungens/gaudenstypology explain how a broker's strategic intent shapes their behaviors, it offers limited insight into how brokers operate at the niche‐regime interface, a context defined by inherent tensions. This inductive study of a digital platform intermediary in the post‐industrial textile waste contexts of Bangladesh and India addresses this by theorizing brokerage as a set of tension‐derived strategies. Our empirical findings identify three tensions: network structure, operational capability, and socially sustainable capability tensions. We then show how the platform addresses these tensions through a dual role:structural brokerage, via semi‐disintermediation, andcapability brokerage, via standardization and legitimization. In addition, the platform engages in identity work to overcome its own challenge of being a new network actor. We contribute a novelcontingent perspectiveon brokerage by unpacking a broker's response to inherent tensions in a transition period. The research also shows how technology‐based intermediaries can be deployed to manage reverse flows, and it furthers understanding of how informal actors can be integrated into formal supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A holistic model encompassing a hospital patient engagement system and its relationship to the quality of provider‐patient interactions is presented. Based on service‐dominant logic, the study examined whether the effects on hospital performance of providers' systemic patient engagement efforts to enable value co‐creation are fully mediated by experiential quality (realized patient engagement). The research model was tested via 2SLS regressions using survey data matched with secondary data. Mediation hypotheses were tested using bootstrapping. The results showed that experiential quality fully mediates the beneficial effects of a hospital patient engagement system on patient recommendation, readmission rate, return on assets, and excess margin. Post hoc tests confirmed the broad applicability of a hospital patient engagement system for reputational and financial advantage.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Talking with Your Hands: How Hand Gestures Influence Communication</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From salespeople and entrepreneurs to politicians and influencers, marketplace actors often communicate with their hands. But despite how integral these movements are to communication, little work in marketing has examined their effects. Might moving one’s hands while speaking increase persuasion? And if so, what types of movements are more impactful, and why? A multimethod investigation, including automated video analysis of thousands of presentations, application of a large multimodal model on almost 200,000 video segments, and preregistered controlled experiments, demonstrates that hand movement can boost impact. Further, the results demonstrate that certain hand gestures (i.e., illustrators) are particularly impactful. By making content easier to understand, using illustrators makes speakers seem more competent, which increases persuasion. Taken together, these findings shed light on hand movement’s impact, deepen understanding around nonverbal communication, and highlight how automated video analysis and multimodal models can provide insights into consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, evolving from reactive tools to proactive collaborators, reshape team dynamics in today's digital workplaces. Text‐based collaboration now frequently involves AI participants that perform tasks traditionally handled by humans, such as creative problem‐solving and decision‐making. This transition has been linked to changes in group dynamics, particularly in relation to social presence, which appears to shape the patterns of productivity and collaboration. We conducted three empirical studies on human–AI teams to investigate the relationship between social presence and willingness to depend on teammates, team‐oriented commitment, and motivation to contribute. Drawing on social presence theory and theory of planned behaviour, our results show that while social presence has a direct association with motivation to contribute, an equally important indirect pathway is associated with human factors like team‐oriented commitment and team members' willingness to depend on each other. We show that while social presence is significantly associated with behavioural intentions, greater AI familiarity and understandability are associated with a stronger relationship, raising questions about the sufficiency of relying solely on anthropomorphic features. Our study contributes to the understanding of human–AI collaboration in social presence research, highlighting the importance of considering social and interpersonal processes in hybrid teams. Our findings have managerial implications for organizations looking to adopt AI‐based systems for collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms face increasing pressure to moderate harmful content while preserving user engagement and free expression. We examine shadowbanning—a strategy that hides content without notifying the user—and compare it to traditional content removal. Our results show that if users only moderately believe that shadowbanning occurs, the platform benefits from a larger user base and higher profit, which also leads to greater social welfare than with content removal or no moderation. Shadowbanning allows the platform to reduce users’ exposure to extreme content without deterring content creators, enabling more participation of users across the extremeness spectrum. However, outcomes depend on user beliefs and the accuracy of moderation technology. When users are highly suspicious of shadowbanning or when moderation tools are significantly imperfect, the platform’s incentives—and the societal benefits—decline. These findings offer practical insights for platform designers and regulators: shadowbanning can be effective, but its benefits hinge on how transparently and accurately it is implemented. Policymakers should account for user perceptions and technological capabilities when evaluating or regulating opaque moderation strategies.</content>

    <title>Evening the Odds in a Gendered Workplace: The Empowering Role of Knowledge Repositories</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations become more diverse, women are increasingly entering traditionally male-dominated technical fields like HVAC repair. However, in these gendered workplaces, women face structural biases that limit their access to the informal knowledge sharing networks crucial for task performance while also encountering significant barriers to promotion and career advancement. This study examines how access to codified organizational knowledge through online repositories can help women circumvent these workplace disadvantages, enabling them to enhance their performance and improve their prospects for professional success. Accessing general knowledge from a knowledge repository on a just-in-time basis helps improve female technician’s performance. These female technicians’ comprehensive information processing approach is the underlying mechanism of why women can better utilize general knowledge in general documents to aid independent problem solving in the field. Also, although women in this male-gendered domain face barrier to promotion, accessing more firm-specific knowledge from problem-solution documents increases their likelihood of being promoted within the firm, helping them mitigate some of the extant bias against women. General knowledge on the other hand helps women find external opportunities for career advancement.</content>

    <title>I‐Deals for Some Employees May (Not) Be Ideal for the Team: Positive and Negative Relationships Between I‐Deals Differentiation and Team Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reflecting a more balanced employer–employee relationship in which employees have latitude to shape aspects of their employment, idiosyncratic deals (i‐deals) are voluntary, personalized, nonstandard agreements that employees negotiate with their employers. In teams, i‐deals differentiation (i‐dealsD), the extent to which the degree of these arrangements varies across members, is a key form of HR differentiation. While research has largely emphasized its negative effects, we propose that the impact of i‐dealsDon team effectiveness depends on the type of i‐deals. We focus on career, flexibility, and task i‐deals, the most common types of i‐deals that employees across different jobs can negotiate with their manager. Drawing on social comparison theory, we argue that career and flexibility i‐dealsDrelate positively to team relationship conflict, and in turn associate with lower customer‐related outcomes. In contrast, task i‐dealsDrelate negatively to team relationship conflict, and subsequently associate positively with customer‐related outcomes. We test our model in two samples: a field study with three‐source data collected from 59 stores of a national restaurant chain located in the United States (Study 1) and a field study with two‐source data collected from 108 teams from three service companies located in China (Study 2). Across both studies, flexibility i‐dealsDand task i‐dealsDhad a negative and a positive association, respectively, with team customer‐related outcomes via team relationship conflict, while career i‐dealsDwas unrelated to our outcomes of interest. We advance the literatures on i‐deals and HR differentiation, and offer practical insights into the implementation of i‐dealsDin teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores how state and religious providers of education compete during the nation building process. Using novel administrative data, we characterize the evolution of Indonesia’s Islamic education system and religious school choice after the introduction of mass public primary schooling in the 1970s. Funded through informal taxation, Islamic schools competed with the state by entering in the same markets. While primary enrollment shifted towards state schools, religious education increased overall as Islamic schools absorbed growing demand for secondary education. In the short run, electoral support for the secular regime weakened in markets with greater public school construction. Over the long run, Islamic schools established at this juncture are more differentiated in terms of religious curriculum, and cohorts exposed to mass public schooling as children are more invested in religion than in the national identity. Our findings offer a new perspective on the political economy of education reforms and the emergence of parallel systems of public goods provision.</content>

    <title>Homeownership, Polarization, and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why are job polarization and income inequality higher in large U.S. cities? I offer a new explanation: when house prices grow faster in large cities, middle-income households increasingly cannot afford to own a house there. They move to smaller cities and the middle of the income distribution in large cities hollows out, making them more polarized and unequal. I document that (1) cities with higher price growth experienced larger polarization and increase in inequality since 1980 and (2) middle-income households migrate more often to cheaper locations for housing-related reasons than low- or high-income households. Using a spatial equilibrium model with tenure choice and skill heterogeneity, I find that excess growth of prices relative to incomes and rents in large cities accounts for nearly all of the gap in polarization and almost one-half of the gap in inequality growth between large and small cities from 1980 to 2019.</content>

    <title>Pricing and Design of Pay-to-Win Add-Ons</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In player-versus-player video games, players’ natural desire to win and avoid losing has created an opportunity for game developers to sell “pay-to-win” add-ons, digital items that give buyers a competitive advantage against other players. In this paper, we investigate the pricing and design of a pay-to-win add-on, its effect on the base game, and profit implications for the developer. When a large share of the players are less price sensitive and highly willing to buy the pay-to-win add-on, we find that, surprisingly, the developer may prefer not to introduce it. Further, when it is optimal to sell the add-on, the developer designs it to be less (more) powerful in games where players are highly (moderately) sensitive to losing. In practice, the developer may design rewards or penalties in the game to influence players’ sensitivities to winning and losing, respectively. Our findings suggest that when selling a pay-to-win add-on, the developer ideally prefers players’ loss sensitivity to be neither too high nor too low, whereas high win sensitivity tends to benefit the developer. The introduction of a pay-to-win add-on influences the optimal pricing and design of the base game. In particular, the developer decreases the base game price and may even sell it as a freemium. Despite the price reduction, investment in game quality may actually increase. From the players’ perspective, our analysis shows that the introduction of a pay-to-win add-on can actually improve player surplus. In an extension of our core model, we show that the developer may prefer to customize player-to-player matching probabilities based on ownership of the pay-to-win add-on, making players who own it more likely to be matched against nonowners. However, such customization is not always optimal, and under some market conditions, the developer may optimally abstain from customizing matching probabilities. In another extension, we show that the developer may benefit from setting a negative price for the base game; counterintuitively, player surplus does not increase from negative pricing.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The web appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04610 .</content>

    <title>Human Decision Making in Dynamic Resource Allocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We experimentally study dynamic resource allocation decisions using product development as the context. A product manager must accept or reject a series of design improvement opportunities, given a limited budget. Human subjects perform well when the cost-to-implement is fixed throughout the project. However, in a more complex setting where the cost increases for the latter half of the project, subjects’ performance worsens substantially. We use the strategy frequency estimation method to analyze subjects’ decision mechanisms and find that many subjects are (a) mis-weighting future periods (underweighting in the simple case, overweighting in the complex) and (b) focusing on only the highest value opportunities. These heuristics perform poorly in the complex setting, leading to excess savings and are a counterproductive reaction to the cost increase. Top performers in the complex setting do well by decomposing the problem into two subproblems resembling the simpler setting, which they can handle nearly optimally. In a second study, we test managerial interventions based on prompting this decomposition approach to improve performance in the complex setting. Merely prompting subjects to consider problem decomposition is largely ineffective. However, additionally sharing a “best practice” budget plan that gives information about how and why top performers decompose the problem significantly improves performance. Our results highlight when decision makers will perform well or poorly in a dynamic resource allocation problem and show effective ways to reframe the problem and improve their performance.This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.Funding: The work of D.

    <title>A Global Optimization Algorithm for &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;-Center Clustering of One Billion Samples</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a practical global optimization algorithm for the K-center clustering problem, which aims to select K samples as the cluster centers to minimize the maximum within-cluster distance. Specifically, we propose a reduced-space branch and bound scheme that guarantees convergence to the global optimum in a finite number of steps by only branching on the regions of centers. To improve efficiency, we design a two-stage decomposable lower bound, the solution of which can be derived in a closed form. In addition, we also propose several structure-exploiting acceleration techniques to narrow down the region of centers, including bounds tightening, sample reduction, and parallelization. Extensive studies on synthetic and real-world data sets have demonstrated that our algorithm can solve the K-center problems to global optimal within four hours for 10 million samples in the serial mode and 1 billion samples in the parallel mode, whereas existing studies can only address small-scale problems (e.g., thousands of samples). Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art heuristic methods, the global optimum obtained by our algorithm reduces the objective function by an average of 25.8% on these synthetic and real-world data sets.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2019-05499].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00218 .</content>

    <title>Green Bonds: Reputational Bonding via Media Coverage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on prior literature showing that green bond issuance signals a firm’s environmental commitment, this paper provides empirical evidence on a mechanism that gives credibility to this signal: reputational bonding through increased media coverage. Compared with matched firms, media coverage of a firm’s environmental performance increases significantly after issuing green bonds. This increase persists over time and extends to aspects of environmental performance that go beyond the contractual obligations of the green bond. Although this result is more pronounced for positive news, the increase in negative news is significantly larger for green bond issuers with environmental controversies after green bond issuance. Cross-sectional analyses show that this media coverage increase is concentrated among green bond issuers that are larger, listed on green bond exchanges, and in countries with weaker institutional oversight of environmental issues. To shed light on the effectiveness of this reputational bonding mechanism, I find that higher media attention following green bond issuance is associated with higher environmental performance.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey 262 chief executive officer (CEO) alumni of Harvard Business School and gather evidence on three aspects of each executive’s strategy practice: how formalized it is, how it is developed, and how it is implemented. We report three main results. First, firms with higher adoption of structured strategy practices outperform their peers; they grow faster and are more profitable, especially in industries with greater strategic complexity. Second, the appointment of CEOs with more structured styles appears to drive this outperformance, not firm-specific effects. This raises the question of how an executive comes to adopt more structured strategy practices. Our third finding provides a partial answer; business education can have a lasting impact on a CEO’s strategy practices as evidenced by a regression discontinuity analysis centered around a curriculum change at Harvard Business School.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: Financial support was provided by Harvard Business School.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of venture capital (VC) firms in private mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) contracting, particularly in reducing information asymmetry. Analyzing a proprietary data set of 851 startup acquisitions from 2015 to 2020, I find that M&amp;A contracts are significantly less likely to include earnouts, mechanisms designed to mitigate information asymmetry, when a VC is involved in the transaction. Further analysis reveals that earnouts are more likely in transactions with high information asymmetry between the VC and the buyer. The study also examines the effect of prior relationships between VCs and buyers, showing that these connections not only increase the chances of repeat transactions but also further reduce the reliance on earnouts. These findings suggest that VCs play a crucial role in mitigating information asymmetry, reducing the need for earnouts, and ultimately improving M&amp;A outcomes.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Research funding was provided by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00654 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We take an extended perspective on project success that includespost‐projectoutcomes as well asat‐endandduring‐projectsuccess. To manage projects accordingly, we conceptualize three corresponding orders of uncertainty (outcomes,deliverables, andmeans uncertainties). We study 11 cases of behavioral intervention development (BID) projects to explore how managers handle each of the three orders of uncertainty to achieve post‐project success—fully, partially, or not at all. Our analysis suggests several key insights. The hierarchical nature of multi‐order uncertainty management implies that decreasing a higher‐order uncertainty (e.g., outcomes) increases the next‐lower order (e.g., deliverables). In the studied cases, reducingoutcomes uncertaintytended to increasedeliverablesandmeans uncertainties—causing one step forward to seem like two steps backward. Thus, the sequence of uncertainty‐management activities matters, with post‐project success linked to reducingoutcomes uncertaintybeforedeliverablesandmeans uncertainties. Violations of this sequencing were associated withuncertainty masking, a failure to acknowledge uncertainty that misdirected uncertainty‐management activities. Moreover, the uncertainty‐management activities must be timely, lest they become misaligned with other project activities. These findings elaborate the theorized relationships between uncertainty management and project success. We further outline how project managers can manage uncertainty byreframingoutcomes,rescopingdeliverables, andreplanningmeans.</content>

    <title>Improvising for Learning: How and When Firm‐Level &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Systems Drive Team Exploratory and Exploitative Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly rely on teams to balance innovation and efficiency by simultaneously engaging in exploratory and exploitative learning. However, the cross‐level mechanisms through which firm‐level systems enable such ambidextrous capabilities at the team level remain insufficiently understood. This study develops and tests a multilevel contingency framework that explains how change‐oriented human resource management (HRM) systems foster both forms of team learning through team improvisation—a dual‐purpose capability that integrates real‐time responsiveness with adaptive refinement. Drawing on multisource, time‐lagged data from 205 new product development (NPD) teams nested within 75 pharmaceutical firms, we find that team improvisation mediates the cross‐level relationship between change‐oriented HRM systems and both exploratory and exploitative learning. Furthermore, this mediating effect is contingent upon the nature of intra‐team knowledge sharing: tacit knowledge sharing amplifies the relationship between improvisation and exploratory learning, while explicit knowledge sharing enhances its link with exploitative learning. Our findings offer theoretical insight into how HRM systems cascade across organizational levels to shape team capabilities, advancing perspectives that conceptualize ambidexterity as an emergent property of behavioral routines rather than structural design. Situated within a politically and economically constrained environment, this study also underscores the heightened strategic value of HRM systems in enabling adaptability and innovation under institutional adversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New labels with symbolic value may constitute a strategic resource for firms in established market categories, but these labels must also provide audiences with classificatory utility. We explore this tension and develop a process explanation of how firms in established market categories appropriate new labels under audience scrutiny. Analyzing eleven years (2011–2022) of earnings calls transcripts of eight leading Information Technology services firms, we theorize around their interest in appropriating the label ‘digital.’ We find that such appropriation is shaped by category work – forged in the tension between contrary impulses of the firm and the audience, and enacted through their claims, probes, and claim calibrations. We also highlight the symbolic appropriation dilemma and the unintended consequences of label appropriation for incumbents in established market categories.Managerial SummaryIncumbent firms in established market categories may strive to satisfy their stakeholders' demands for demonstration of both continuity and novelty by developing symbolic management strategies. In doing so, these incumbents may come to view novel category labels as valuable resources for symbolic action. However, the incumbent's pursuit of symbolic action in an established market category is often constrained by the conservative scrutiny of securities analysts. Our study of the global Information Technology services industry reveals the mechanisms of claim calibration deployed by executives to evade or blunt analyst scrutiny while appropriating the digital label. Our study also alerts leading incumbent firms to a dilemma of symbolic management that compels them to confront the trade‐off between symbolic appropriability and symbolic flexibility.</content>

    <title>Sanctions and the Exchange Rate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trade wars and financial sanctions are again becoming an increasingly common part of the international economic landscape, and the dynamics of the exchange rate are often used in real time to evaluate the effectiveness of sanctions and policy responses. We show that sanctions limiting a country's exports or freezing its assets depreciate the exchange rate, while sanctions limiting imports appreciate it, even when both types of policies have exactly the same effect on real allocations, including household welfare and government fiscal revenues. Beyond the direct effect from sanctions, increased precautionary savings in foreign currency also depreciate the exchange rate when they are not offset by the sale of official reserves or financial repression of foreign-currency savings. We show that the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 are quantitatively consistent with the combined effects of these forces calibrated to the observed sanctions and government policies. We evaluate the associated welfare, fiscal and inflationary consequences for both Russia and the coalition of Western countries.</content>

    <title>Ripples in the Pond: Product Portfolio Reconfiguration and Dynamism in the Competitive Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The management literature often overlooks how firms can alter the competitive landscape without introducing groundbreaking changes or innovations. Applying the awareness, motivation, and capability framework from competitive dynamics, we posit that as a firm intensifies its product portfolio reconfiguration, its rivals become increasingly aware and motivated to respond, creating a ripple effect that accelerates change in the competitive environment. However, extreme reconfigurations may decrease rivals’ motivation due to the costly and disruptive nature of keeping pace. We also argue that rivals will be more motivated to respond to reconfigurations from a firm with high customer orientation and when they possess financial slack. Using a longitudinal dataset of 6382 firms’ product portfolios and those of their rivals, we find support for these arguments. This study contributes to competitive dynamics research by expanding the focus to a firm’s entire set of rivals and highlighting how a firm’s competitive moves can result in ripple effects throughout its rival network. We also demonstrate how moderate organizational changes can quickly lead to increased environmental dynamism, an overlooked avenue in research of dynamism. Finally, we suggest that a broadened competitive dynamics perspective rooted in Austrian economics can enhance our understanding of firm adaptation.</content>

    <title>Work Has Changed, Has &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt;? Designing for the Distributed, Fragmented, and Fluid Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses the growing misalignment between traditional human resource management (HRM) systems and the realities of distributed, fluid, and fragmented work. To address this issue, we introduce the FLUID‐HRM framework—a layered design architecture that reconfigures core HRM domains (resourcing, rewards, development, relations, work systems) across onsite, hybrid, and distributed forms of work. The framework is anchored in five structural principles of fluidity: spatial flexibility, temporal desynchronization, employment multiplicity, identity fragmentation, and digital mediation. For each, we propose differentiated HRM responses and corresponding information system (IS) infrastructures. Rather than retrofitting core legacy models, FLUID‐HRM offers a principle‐based approach for designing ethical, effective, and inclusive people systems in boundaryless work environments. By linking structural challenges to HRM innovation, we extend foundational HRM theory and provide actionable guidance for organizations navigating the transformation of work.</content>

    <title>How Activists Collaboratively Divide the Labor of Making Change: The Case of LGBT Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While theories at the crossroads of social movements and organizations have explored different strategies and challenges faced by insider and outsider activists, research examining their collaborations is just emerging. We contribute to this literature by introducing the concept of collaborative division of labor, which theorizes how social movement organizations (SMOs) collaborate through adoption of different roles, leveraging their distinct positions (insiders, outsiders, belonging to different sectors), postures (persuasive or disruptive), and expertise to pursue a common political agenda. Through a study of the LGBT movement in French workplaces, we examine the interactions among eight SMOs with regard to four strategies: amplifying one another’s actions, compelling organizations to respond, threatening organizations’ reputations, and engaging in complementary datactivism (the production and dissemination of data for a social movement cause). Our findings show that SMOs’ division of labor relied on multidirectional collaborations, as activists adopted roles that provided complementary, unidirectional, mutually beneficial, and indirect support to one another. In addition, our research offers counterintuitive insights about the postures of insider and outsider activists, as we argue that these postures do not always align with what is expected in the literature. Last, we reveal how this collaborative division of labor led to several intermediate outcomes, thereby enhancing our understanding of the effects of interactions that go beyond competitive dynamics among groups within the same movement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of childhood cultural upbringing on financial advisor misconduct using novel data on advisors’ childhood addresses. We find that an advisor’s childhood location significantly predicts misconduct, with exposure to misbehavior culture during childhood playing a stronger role than exposure during adulthood. Addressing endogeneity concerns, we conduct several tests that support the notion that our results reflect cultural exposure rather than advisors’ employment choices, location preferences, local conditions, family characteristics, or clientele characteristics. Our findings underscore the formative influence of culture in shaping financial advisors’ personal ethics and could help us understand and prevent financial misconduct.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rising student loan debt and concerns over unaffordable payments provide rationale for “income-driven repayment” (IDR) plans, which aim to protect borrowers from default and resulting financial consequences by linking payments to income. We estimate the causal effect of IDR payment burdens on loan repayment and attainment for several cohorts of first-time IDR applicants using a regression discontinuity design. Borrowers who are not required to make payments experience short-run reductions in delinquency and default risk, primarily because of lower costs of inattention, but this effect fades over the longer run as some borrowers become disconnected from the student loan repayment system.

    <title>The Impact of EITC on Education, Labour Market Trajectories, and Inequalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a complement to the federal earned income tax credit (EITC), some states offer their own EITC, typically calculated as a percentage of the federal EITC. In this paper, we analyse the effect of state EITC on education using policy discontinuities at US state borders. Our estimates reveal that an increase in the state EITC leads to a statistically significant increase in the high school dropout rate. We then use a life-cycle matching model with directed search and endogenous educational choices, search intensities, hirings, hours worked, and separations to investigate the effects of EITC on the labour market in the long run and along the transitional dynamics. We show that a tax credit targeted at low-wage (and low-skilled) workers reduces the relative return to schooling, thereby generating a powerful disincentive to pursue long-term studies. In the long run, this results in an increase in the proportion of low-skilled workers in the economy, which may have important implications for employment, productivity, and income inequality. Finally, we use the model to determine the optimal design of the EITC.</content>

    <title>Two-Sided Benefits of Price Transparency in Smallholder Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information platforms have emerged in the developing world to improve price transparency and welfare for smallholder suppliers. Meanwhile, sustaining welfare improvement often requires such platforms to benefit both suppliers and buyers. This paper studies the impact of price transparency on market price and welfare in smallholder supply chains, and identifies conditions and driving forces for creating benefits to both suppliers and buyers. Motivated by granular data from smallholder supply chains, we develop a new Hotelling model of price search, where price-setting buyers face the operational challenges of demand asymmetry and costly underage or overage amid uncertain supply. We find that high overage costs, combined with high demand asymmetry that dominates random supply variations, give rise to two-sided benefits, driven by price competition benefiting the suppliers and demand signaling benefiting the buyers under increased transparency. Moreover, achieving two-sided benefit requires implementing a well-chosen level of price transparency, and, in some cases, creating a low uncertainty environment for buyers. These results help close the gap between the empirical literature and the theoretical economic literature on this topic, and offer possible explanations for the variation in empirical findings. We provide managerial recommendations for information platform designers, including for our partnering platform, on identifying the target markets and whether to implement full or partial transparency.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by Stanford King Center on Global Development, Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), and Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01617 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the role of vertical incentives between upstream issuers and downstream brokers in the retail bond market when there exist agency problems. Although arms-length transaction regulations require that vertical incentives not influence their activities, I show that both upstream issuers and downstream brokers are sensitive to vertical incentives. I then present a structural model in order to measure the degree of vertical incentives for downstream brokers, controlling for the extent of agency problems. The structural estimates show that brokers are willing to give up one dollar of their own profit if their vertically integrated issuer’s profit goes up by 1.25 dollars.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03572 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using director-specific, within-firm variation in poison pills, we find that pill-adopting nonexecutive directors experience a decrease in shareholder votes, an increase in termination rates across all their directorships, and a decrease in the likelihood of new board appointments. These consequences are not because of poor firm performance, active bid resistance, or hedge fund activism, and accrue especially when the adopted pill is relatively costly to the firm. Firms have positive stock price reactions when pill-associated directors die unexpectedly, compared with negative returns for other directors. We conclude that pill-adopting directors experience a decrease in the value of their services.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03558 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how relationship lending affects the transmission of bankruptcy reforms on credit terms and bank enforcement mechanisms, using a unique database containing the universe of credits of a large Italian bank. Lower creditor rights lead the bank to reduce expected recovery rates, worsen credit terms, and tighten bank enforcement actions. Bank-borrower power dampens the terms’ impact at the cost of tougher borrower renegotiations. Older and more credit-dependent borrowers receive less unfavorable terms but see larger increases in credit suspensions and legal actions. Results suggest that policies curbing credit enforcement weaken the role of bank power in dampening economic shocks.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers often face the challenge of protecting parent brand equity when launching brand extensions into low–fit categories. This article recommends that managers can minimize any negative impact of low fit extensions by using a unique segmentation strategy as well as framing the extension fit in terms of brand personality. Specifically, this research introduces person–thing orientation as a framework in the brand extension context to effectively segment consumers based on their environmental orientation. Person-oriented individuals selectively examine the environment and direct their attention towards people and social relationships. Thing-oriented individuals primarily focus on objects and their functionality. We demonstrate that thing-oriented consumers are less likely to exhibit negative feedback effects. Person-oriented consumers respond positively when low–fit extensions align with the parent brand’s personality. Importantly, we demonstrate that person thing orientation can be leveraged managerially through observable proxies (e.g., college major, media context). These findings offer actionable insights for tailoring brand extension strategies to target the right audience, frame extensions effectively, and minimize parent brand dilution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper establishes that mutual funds strategically time their trades in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) stocks around disclosure dates to inflate their sustainability ratings. This claim is supported by three empirical findings. First, we show that funds' ESG betas increase shortly before disclosure and decrease shortly afterwards. Second, we document that post‐disclosure fund returns are higher but have lower ESG exposure than disclosed portfolios. Third, we provide evidence that ESG stock prices temporarily rise before disclosure and decline afterwards. Overall, we establish that green window dressing positively impacts fund sustainability ratings, performance, and flows.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study exchange rate expectations in surveys of financial professionals and find that they successfully forecast currency appreciation at the two‐year horizon, both in and out of sample. Exchange rate expectations are also interpretable, in the sense that three macro‐finance variables—the risk‐neutral covariance between the exchange rate and equity market, the real exchange rate, and the current account relative to GDP—explain most of their variation. There is no “secret sauce,” however, in expectations: After controlling for the three macro‐finance variables, the residual information in survey expectations does not forecast currency appreciation in our sample.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how societal-level institutional changes, specifically market transition in emerging economies such as China, shape entrepreneurial beliefs. While market transition is typically expected to foster rationalization and professionalism, thus diminishing traditional beliefs such as familism and nepotism, real-world observations suggest an opposite trend. To address this puzzle, we argue that, while market transition can facilitate the development of formal institutions, it also has unanticipated consequences, that is, a decline in social trust and an increase in psychological uncertainty, thus prompting entrepreneurs to adhere to traditional beliefs rather than adopt modern ones. In addition, we contend that entrepreneurs’ social origins moderate the impact of market transition on their beliefs because, as a key stratification mechanism, they can shape entrepreneurs’ vulnerability to declining social trust and heightened psychological uncertainty. Our analysis of national survey data on Chinese private entrepreneurs supports these arguments, thus offering a more nuanced understanding of how market transition influences entrepreneurial cognition and behavior and explaining the persistence of traditional beliefs despite market reforms.</content>

    <title>Why and How Family Business Research Should Account for Differences Between Public and Private Family Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This methodological brief explains why and how family business research should account for public/private ownership to better understand how family control and influence affect firm outcomes. To support our arguments, we review the methodologies used in family business studies and identify four methodological pitfalls that obscure heterogeneity in family firm private/public ownership. We propose practical solutions to address those pitfalls and apply them to a recent study, showing how accounting for private/public ownership alters its empirical findings. The implication of our brief is that more fine-grained methodological attention to public/private family firm ownership will enhance family business research.</content>

    <title>The Surrogate Index: Combining Short-Term Proxies to Estimate Long-Term Treatment Effects more Rapidly and Precisely</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common challenge in estimating the impact of interventions (e.g., job training programs, educational programs) is that many outcomes of interest (e.g., lifetime earnings or other labor market outcomes) are observed with a long delay. In biomedical settings this is often addressed by using short-term outcomes as so-called “surrogates” for the outcome of interest, e.g., tumor size as a surrogate for mortality in cancer studies. We build on this literature by combining multiple, possibly qualitatively distinct, short-term outcomes (e.g., short-run earnings and employment indicators) systematically into a “surrogate index.” Under the Prentice surrogacy assumption, which requires that the primary outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogates, we show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome. We also relate the surrogacy assumption to a set of structural, causal assumptions. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of each of the key assumptions, and we provide simple methods to validate these assumptions using additional observed outcomes. We apply our method to analyze the long-term impacts of a multi-site job training experiment in California. Rather than waiting a full nine years to directly observe the long-term impact, we show that it is possible to use short-term (the first six quarters) outcomes as surrogates. One could have estimated the program’s long-term impacts on mean employment rates using the employment rates observed in the first six quarters, with a 35% reduction in standard errors.</content>

    <title>Reskilling the Workforce for AI: Domain Expertise and Algorithmic Literacy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study provides evidence that AI and algorithms act as complements to domain expertise, creating the greatest value when algorithmic literacy is broadly diffused among workers. Unlike earlier business technologies that concentrated expertise in IT specialists, AI and algorithms are most effective when domain experts themselves can interpret and apply them. Using two workforce datasets, I show that demand for algorithmic skills is rising among domain experts, frontier firms diffuse these skills broadly, and markets reward firms’ AI and algorithmic investments more when such capabilities are dispersed. The spread of no-code and natural language tools accelerates this shift by lowering barriers to use and allowing domain experts to integrate algorithms into their decision-making processes. These patterns underscore the importance of workforce training and organizational design in realizing productivity gains from AI adoption.This paper has been accepted by D. J.

    <title>Optimal Interventions for Increasing Healthy Food Consumption Among Low-Income Populations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than $60 billion per year in the United States is spent on policies aimed to increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption among low-income households. Many of these policy interventions are either monetary (e.g., financial incentives) or education related. The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of these interventions through a more strategic and personalized allocation of funds. This paper introduces a consumer behavioral model for grocery shopping decisions, which is nested into the policymaker’s upper-level optimization problem. The policymaker’s goal is to ensure that the FV spending of all consumers in a given population exceeds a specified threshold by utilizing a small strategic set of different intervention bundles—combinations of monetary and education-related interventions. Although an exact solution to the upper-level problem is intractable, we provide an analytical upper bound on the number of intervention bundles needed to achieve the policymaker’s goal, as well as a method for constructing these intervention bundles and assigning them to individuals based on their characteristics. We demonstrate the practicality of the model and approach using the low-income households in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s FoodAPS data set.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, management science.Funding: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under [Grant 1745302].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02324 .</content>

    <title>Long Goodbyes: How Do Private Equity Funds Manage Sell-Downs After Initial Public Offerings?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how private equity funds (general partners (GPs)) sell down their stakes in companies they take public. GPs earn private equity management fees and carried interest on public equity holdings. The average duration of post–initial public offering (IPO) holdings is three years, whereas lockups expire after six months. Private equity–backed IPOs perform well during the lockup, but we find no evidence that GPs add value for investors through the timing of their aftermarket sell-down strategies. GPs appear reluctant to sell losers, consistent with behavioral biases and agency effects. Long goodbyes are more likely when the fund is performing better, resulting in higher payments to GPs.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivanisha, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02043 .</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence as an Organizing Capability Arising from Human‐Algorithm Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we move beyond the prevailing view of artificial intelligence (AI) as an independent entity within organizations, which, we argue, risks obscuring potential explanations of the effects of AI on organizing. Drawing on posthumanism, we propose an ontological shift in conceptualizing AI. We theorize that, instead of residing within algorithmic actors, AI arises from the relations among human and algorithmic actors as an organizing capability. This capability is characterized by connectivity, codependence, and emergence as core properties, and contributes to organizational analysing, learning, and acting in pursuit of organizational goals. The shift from the entity view to the organizing capability view of AI has significant implications for understanding its organizational effects and opens new avenues for research in human‐algorithm collaboration, algorithmic management, and organizational intelligence, while counterbalancing tendencies to treat AI as autonomous agents.</content>

    <title>Anomalies and Their Short‐Sale Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Short‐sale costs eliminate the abnormal returns on asset pricing anomaly portfolios. While many anomalies persist out‐of‐sample before accounting for short‐sale costs, they cannot be exploited with long‐short strategies due to stock borrow fees. Using a comprehensive sample of 162 anomalies, the average long‐short portfolio return is a significant 0.14% per month before short‐sale costs, and the returns are due to the short leg. However, the average is −0.01% once returns are adjusted for borrow fees. Moreover, anomalies are not profitable even before fees if the high‐fee observations, representing 12% of stock dates, are excluded from the analysis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the expected consequences of negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news on firms' future profits. After learning about negative ESG news, analysts significantly downgrade their forecasts at short and longer horizons. Negative ESG news affects forecasts more strongly at longer horizons than other types of negative corporate news. The negative revisions of earnings forecasts following negative ESG news largely reflect expectations of lower future sales, rather than higher future costs. Quantitatively, forecast revisions can explain most of the negative impacts of ESG news on firm value. Analysts are correct to revise forecasts downward following negative ESG news.</content>

    <title>Macroeconomic Information Acquisition Around Earnings Clusters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research shows that investors acquire and process less firm‐specific information on days when many firms announce earnings (hereafter earnings clusters). We show that investors gather moremacroeconomicinformation during earnings clusters, that this behavior is amplified during negative economic shocks and concurrent macroeconomic announcements, and that these information acquisition patterns have implications for equity valuations. Our findings are consistent with the benefit of extracting macroeconomic information from earnings announcements increasing during earnings clusters, which we confirm empirically. Thus, our results help explain why investors focus less on individual firm news during earnings clusters: They rationally redirect their attention to the most beneficial information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study plaintiff law firms in corporate litigation, focusing on “star” firms that dominate settlement outcomes. Stars are associated with larger settlements; however, much of this effect is predicted by the defendant's litigation insurance coverage, suggesting assortative matching of stars with lawsuits that have ex ante larger expected payoffs. Moreover, stars charge higher fees for a given settlement size. Additional tests suggest that visibility and information asymmetry vis‐à‐vis less sophisticated plaintiffs help sustain the stars’ market share. These findings advance our understanding of corporate litigation and the agency relationship between plaintiff law firms and their clients.</content>
