    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In March 2020, safe asset markets experienced surprising and unprecedented price crashes. We explain how strategic investor behavior can create such market fragility in a model with investors valuing safety, investors valuing liquidity, and constrained dealers. While safety investors and liquidity investors can form a symbiotic relationship with offsetting trades during times of stress, strategic interactions among liquidity investors harbor the potential for self-fulfilling fragility. When the market is fragile, standard flight-to-safety can have a destabilizing effect and trigger a “dash-for-cash” by liquidity investors. Well-designed policy interventions can reduce market fragility ex ante and restore orderly functioning ex post.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a panel of over 28,400 S&amp;P 500 return forecasts by CFOs to examine whether the extent of CFOs’ miscalibration—providing forecast confidence intervals that are too narrow—decreases over time. We find no improvement with task repetition or evidence of learning, that is, no improvement in response to past performance. Across CFOs, miscalibration appears to be a persistent personal trait. We find some evidence that the degree of miscalibration is related to birth cohort and stock market familiarity. (JEL G41, G30, D22, D83, D84)</content>

    <title>Moving toward consensus: an examination of trends in investment fair values</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A primary argument against fair value measurement is the lack of verifiability, where verifiability is defined as consensus in measurement by independent parties. We evaluate this argument by investigating trends in the consensus of reported fair values. Our findings indicate that consensus increased between 2005 and 2019, as evidenced by reductions in the fair value range and standard deviation. Further analyses suggest that enhanced data availability—driven by public dissemination of trade information—serves as a mechanism for this trend. We also document that securities subject to testing by larger external auditors with more resources to take advantage of enhanced data availability are associated with a stronger trend in increasing consensus. Finally, this trend appears to be stronger in situations when management has a heightened opportunity to record a biased estimate. While conventional arguments express concern over management’s ability to manipulate fair values, our results demonstrate patterns consistent with improved verifiability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Are More Information Details Less Useful? A Comparison of Product Contextualization in Customer Images and Review Texts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Product reviews, a type of user-generated content (UGC), are found to affect sales; however, their impact on product returns has not been fully explored. Research has revealed that inflated ratings and catchy product images may increase returns, which spells trouble for sellers. To address the issue, we examine howproduct contextualizationin user-posted images and review texts helps online shoppers assess a product’sfunctionalityandaestheticsand, in turn, reduce returns. Using the archival data from an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer, we reveal that contextual cues in UGC help decrease product returns. When comparing the roles of image with text, we explore distinct mechanisms for shoppers’ utilization of contextual cues to assess each type of product feature. For functionality, the level of detail in writing suggests that contextual information for these attributes (e.g., the warmth, stretchability, and water-resistance of a jacket) is likely better delineated in text than image since many of them are measurable (e.g., temperature), can be depicted in subtleties (e.g., running vs. jogging), and, sometimes, on a time dimension (e.g., a two-hour rain). As a result, shoppers’ product evaluation and return decisions are more likely to be influenced by such content. However, our data analysis shows the opposite. Although shoppers perceive verbal contextual cues for these product features as more accurate, detailed, and sufficient, they prefer to use images to assess such attributes because the cost of processing visual information is lower. Regarding aesthetics, since buyers often adopt a sensory-based strategy to evaluate these features (e.g., the design of a shirt), images are likely to be a preferred choice. We find evidence for this argument. Yet, when a product’s aesthetics are closely tied to its geometric fit (e.g., sleeve length), contextual cues in the text have a stronger effect on returns. We offer business insights on leveraging UGC to enhance operating cost management by reducing product returns.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Targeted Automation and Sustaining Human-AI Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many decision processes, a decision maker or planner must review and optionally adjust the recommendations that are generated by a decision support system (DSS). When the DSS is well-tuned to its task, adjustments by a planner can be rare and may even degrade the DSS’s performance. Targeted automation could address these inefficiencies by predicting whether a planner will adjust a recommendation and improve the performance of the system. The remaining recommendations can be automated. However, as more recommendations are automated, fewer will receive planner input. This may starve the prediction model of the observations it needs for retraining. To maintain predictive performance, we must therefore address the loss that automation imposes on the model’s ability to learn from a planner’s decisions over time. Using four years of procurement ordering data from our research partner, a large materials handling equipment manufacturer, we develop and train a series of machine learning classifiers that predict individual instances in which a planner will improve a DSS-generated procurement order decision. We mitigate the performance erosion that automation engenders by structuring the selection of the model’s classification threshold similar to a newsvendor problem, accounting for the value of learning and balancing the costs and benefits of under or over automating. In our setting, this approach automates around 84% of all DSS recommendations while retaining three times more planner improvements than random automation. The models maintain their predictive performance over time, despite losing automated outcomes for retraining and substantial dataset shift. Our research contributes to a broader debate on the allocation of decision authority between humans and algorithms, and creates a framework for targeted automation in an operational setting that balances the net benefits of automation versus the long-term benefits of algorithmic learning.</content>

    <title>Inventor Commingling and Innovation in Technology Start-up Acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore a form of postacquisition integration by which inventors from the target and acquiring organizations share and integrate technological and organizational knowledge, performing joint research and development. We refer to this phenomenon as inventor commingling. Grounded in the knowledge-based view, we posit that commingling enhances the target firm’s innovation performance by enabling the transfer of the acquirer’s organizational knowledge, preserving the target’s existing knowledge base. We explore how commingling differs from structural integration and how the two forms of integration can be combined for postacquisition management. We posit that commingling diminishes the negative effects of structural integration, whereas structural integration may enhance the efficacy of commingling. Because organizational knowledge is firm-specific and cumulative, commingling efficacy should increase with acquirer commingling inventors’ tenure. To test these predictions, we assemble a large sample of acquisitions to study the effect of these forms of postacquisition integration on acquired entity innovation outcomes. Our results support a positive commingling innovation effect, which is more pronounced under structural integration. A high degree of commingling can mitigate the negative effects of postacquisition structural integration documented in the literature. We use direct flights between the acquisition party locations as an instrument to address the potentially endogenous process of inventor commingling. We find consistent results. Our study raises the possibility of inventor commingling as a distinct form of postacquisition integration, which holds the potential of effectively transferring organizational knowledge and supporting postacquisition innovation output, sidestepping the classic postacquisition integration–autonomy trade-off.Funding: This work was supported by Henry Crown Institute of Business Research at Tel-Aviv University; Mack Institute for Innovation Management at Wharton; Wharton Global Initiatives Research Funding Program.</content>

    <title>Seeing Both Sides: How Shared Experience Can Improve Entrepreneur Evaluations of Investors Through Perceived Empathy</title>
    <updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarly attention in the venture funding literature is primarily devoted to tie selection, with a great deal of that attention focused on the perspective of the investor evaluating the entrepreneur as a candidate for funding. But venture funding can be conceptualized as a long-term, dual-sided matching process. Two mixed methods studies offer support for a specific basis of background similarity that can influence entrepreneur evaluations of investor tie potential: shared entrepreneurial experience. An archival study of 677 entrepreneurs evaluating 408 investors demonstrates that investors with entrepreneurial experience are more likely to be perceived as empathetic than investors without this experience. In turn, entrepreneurs rate investors whom they perceive to be empathetic more favorably than those they do not perceive to be empathetic. Perceived empathy thus emerges as a mechanism that serves to mediate the positive relationship between shared entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneur ratings of investors. A preregistered between-subjects experiment conducted on 481 entrepreneurs exposed to otherwise comparable investor profiles randomized for experience complements the correlational evidence from the archival study with causal support for each of these paths. Shedding light on the key components of perceived empathy, linguistic analyses indicate the extent to which cognitive perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur thinks) and affective perspective taking (understanding how the entrepreneur feels) mediate the effect. Gender implications are discussed as this work also documents that women are less likely to traverse the path from entrepreneurship into investing, restricting their ability to reap these relational upsides.Funding: This research was supported by faculty budgets at London Business School and Georgetown University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18429 .</content>

    <title>Round Number Preferences and Left-Digit Bias: Evidence from Credit Card Repayments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine round number preferences and left-digit bias in credit card repayments. We show half of all manual credit card payments are at a small set of round-number values, although all values between the statement minimum and balance were permissible. We use minimum payments, which place a floor on the payment value, to measure the strength of rounding behavior in a natural experiment. We find that when the minimum payment level just rules out a round number from the bottom of the range of possible repayment (e.g., a minimum payment of £50.01 just rules out a payment of £50.00), payments at the next round number jump by 15%–20% (e.g., payments at £60.00). That is, in response to a smooth increase in minimum payments, the selected payments jump up a ladder of round numbers when each lower rung is removed. We also see a classic—although nuanced—left digit bias. When the balance increases such that the left digit changes (e.g., from £1,999 to £2,000), payments in full drop by 3%–8% as if an increase in the left digit makes the balance seem much larger. But average repayments increase by 10%–15%, as smaller partial repayments are all dragged up the ladder rungs. This preference for a small set of round numbers as payment values and this effect of left digit bias on the level of repayment have policy implications. Rounding could be used by policy makers to encourage faster paydown of credit card debt, using one-click “rounds-ups,” defaults, or shrouding. These policy options could deliver interest savings of up to 40%.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [Grants ES/K002201/1, ES/N018192/1, ES/P008976/1, and ES/V004867/1] and the Leverhulme [Grant RP2012-V-022].

    <title>Does Trading Spur Specialization? Evidence from Patenting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how the market for technology (facilitated by the establishment of patent exchanges in China) affects innovation specialization. We find that the market for technology induces (i) specialization between patent buyers and sellers, (ii) specialization between patent licensors and licensees, and (iii) specialization based on a firm’s research and development efficiency. All these three specialization patterns indicate that the market for technology promotes comparative advantage–based innovation specialization. Firms with a comparative advantage in creating innovation redirect their resources toward producing patents, whereas firms with a comparative advantage in commercializing innovation switch their effort toward launching new products. A firm also shrinks its scope of innovation and invents in technological fields with greater proximity. Financial friction hampers innovation specialization and relieving trading friction in the market for technology mitigates such negative consequences.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of student loan forbearance on job search outcomes. Our experimental setting is the 2020 federal student loan moratorium that provided some borrowers with forbearance by pausing the payments on their student loans. We use data on unemployment insurance claims, payroll records, and credit histories to compare unemployed borrowers who received forbearance to unemployed borrowers who had to continue making payments. We find that the payment pause did not have any economically or statistically significant effects on job search durations or subsequent incomes. Further, we find no heterogeneity in these effects across borrowers’ financial, demographic, or labor market characteristics.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04047 .</content>

    <title>The Usefulness and Limited Supply of Disclosure Accessibility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm disclosures are mostly unstructured and textual, imposing substantial processing costs on investors. We examine firms’ incentives to enhance the accessibility of these disclosures by expending resources to make them easier for investors to process. We show that an equilibrium with a positive supply of accessibility can be difficult to sustain—even though investors view accessibility as a favorable signal of firm productivity. We further explore how the supply of accessibility interacts with the quality of the numerical (easier-to-analyze) signals and textual (harder-to-analyze) disclosures. Our analysis generates predictions consistent with empirical evidence and offers a framework for evaluating policy initiatives and accounting standards aimed at improving accessibility.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Homing Alliances and Price Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OTT subscription video streaming industry has witnessed significant growth and heightened competition in recent years, marked by the influx of new players. At the same time, we are observing an interesting phenomenon where competing services are forming new alliances that facilitate consumer multi-homing. For instance, Amazon Prime Video has partnered with services, such as (HBO) MAX and Paramount+, to enhance the combined viewing experience for consumers through seamless integration. We build a game-theoretic model with horizontally differentiated services to examine how an alliance facilitating multi-homing between two competing services affects price competition in the market. We find that the alliance’s impact on price competition depends on the level of content differentiation in the market – competition intensifies when differentiation is high but relaxes when differentiation is low. The alliance benefits the partnering services as long as the differentiation is not too high, and interestingly, may increase the profitability of a third non-partnering service when differentiation is sufficiently low. We show that consumer surplus increases under the alliance, even if price competition is relaxed. We also investigate a focal service’s decision to partner with one of two competing services and show that it prefers partnering with a service that has high quality content but a smaller loyal base. Our research offers insights into the current landscape of the OTT video streaming market and provides implications for both managers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Pick-the-Winner-Picker Heuristic: Preference for Categorically Correct Forecasts</title>
    <updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People routinely make decisions based on predictions made by others (e.g., political pundits, market analysts), so it is in their best interest to identify high-quality forecasts. Experts characterize good forecasting as minimization of continuous error (i.e., predictions close to the eventual outcome). By contrast, the present work reveals that laypeople typically see good forecasts as those that correctly predict an event’s categorical outcome (e.g., the winning team). Using within-subjects, between-subjects, and incentive-compatible designs, fifteen studies demonstrate this “pick-the-winner-picker heuristic” as well as its psychological mechanism: People evaluate forecasts by assigning separate weights to (a) categorical correctness and (b) continuous error minimization, depending on the overall importance of the categorical and continuous dimensions for that situation. Thus, in the common case when the categorical dimension matters most (e.g., sports contests), people prize forecasts that accurately predicted the categorical outcome (e.g., the winner, not the margin of victory). However, when the categorical dimension’s stakes are experimentally reduced, an attenuation is observed. While this describes how people typically evaluate forecasts, crucially, a dimension’s importance is not necessarily related to its diagnosticity of forecaster skill or reliability. Accordingly, the pick-the-winner-picker heuristic may constitute a normative mistake, while framing manipulations help debias judgments.</content>

    <title>Routine Dynamics at a Cardiac First‐Aid Unit: How Context, Emotions, and Identities Drive the Adaptation of Action Patterns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emotions are a catalyst for actions. They are therefore important for developing an understanding of organizational routines as generative patterns of interdependent actions. To investigate how the performances and action patterns of routines are impacted by emotion changes brought about by alterations in the context of routine enactment, we conducted an ethnographic inquiry centring on a diagnostic routine at a hospital's cardiac first‐aid unit. Our findings show that context changes from off‐peak to peak times and vice versa engendered differences in the emotions of doctors and nurses because of, respectively, conformity and non‐conformity between their salient identities and their situated experiences. This triggered actions that produced variation in routine performances and action patterns. Drawing on our findings, we present a grounded model that theorizes two complementary emotions and identity‐linked mechanisms that explain variety and stability in action patterns. We discuss the theoretical contributions and implications of our model and findings for research on routine dynamics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In contrast to inclusion research that often treats work as a neutral, passive background, this study theorizes the active role of work in producing an inclusive organization. We adopt a practice‐theoretical approach that examines the accomplishment of work activities through their discourses, embodiment, and material arrangements, critically analysing both their inclusionary and exclusionary effects. Through an ethnographic study of an airport security company, we found that performing work along the ends of safety and hospitality played a crucial role in the local, situated formation of a collective of employees, recognition of individual contribution, and emergence of egalitarian relationships among security agents. Building on these findings, we discuss how the enactment of work‐related ends can serve as a key place for inclusion interventions, highlighting the concept of ‘horizon of intelligible actions’ as a central explanation. Furthermore, we emphasize how the interconnectedness – the nexus – of work activities as well as material arrangements are crucial in reinforcing or undermining inclusionary and exclusionary effects.</content>

    <title>Single paper meta‐analysis is unavoidable</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advocate that the multiple studies of a common phenomenon that are featured in a typical behavioral research paper be jointly analyzed to provide a statistical summary of the set of studies as a whole. Indeed, we view such single paper meta‐analysis as unavoidable in typical behavioral research papers because (i) such papers feature multiple studies of a common phenomenon, (ii) such papers contain summaries of those studies, and (iii) statistical summaries of studies (i.e., meta‐analyses) are superior to non‐statistical summaries of them. Nonetheless, the current dominant practice is for such papers to feature separate statistical analyses of the data from each of the studies but to contain a non‐statistical summary of the multiple studies rather than a statistical summary. We believe that this is regrettable and therefore aim to rectify matters. Consequently, we review some considerations about meta‐analysis and statistical analysis more broadly; compare single paper meta‐analysis to traditional meta‐analysis and illustrate its benefits via a case study; discuss and dismiss concern about single paper meta‐analysis; and discuss single paper meta‐analysis and the review process.</content>

    <title>A General-Purpose IT Intervention to Improve Human Decision Making, Strengthen Passwords, and Reduce Receptivity to Misinformation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Latency—the delay between a user’s action and a system’s response—is often viewed as a problem to be eliminated. Yet our research shows that latency is not always harmful and can even improve decision making under the right conditions. Across two sets of studies, we find that latency enhances decision accuracy when it occurs after task-relevant information has been presented but before a decision is made. In these cases, the pause functions as a “mental speed bump,” prompting users to shift from quick, intuitive judgments to slower, more reflective thinking. However, when latency occurs without relevant content, performance declines, likely because of mind wandering and disengagement. For practitioners, this means that latency can be deliberately integrated into system design to encourage deeper cognitive processing in high-stakes or complex tasks, such as financial decisions, medical diagnostics, or security-critical actions. For policymakers, the findings suggest a shift in focus: rather than universally minimizing latency, standards and best practices could account for situations in which strategic delays benefit user outcomes. By reframing latency as a design variable rather than a nuisance, organizations can leverage it to support more accurate, thoughtful decision making, improving performance in contexts in which getting the right answer matters most.</content>

    <title>Executive Pay Cuts and Executive Turnover</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of executive pay cuts on executive turnover. While previous research has largely focused on the drivers of pay increases of top management team (TMT) members or the effects of their relative pay standing on executive behavior, the prevalence and consequences of pay cuts have received limited attention. Drawing on temporal comparison theory, I argue that executive pay cuts are positively associated with executive turnover. I then propose that the impact of pay cuts on executive turnover depends on contextual cues that influence how executives interpret these cuts. Specifically, I argue that the effect is stronger for salary cuts than for pay‐for‐performance (PFP) cuts. I also argue that the impact of a pay cut is stronger when an executive is paid below the TMT pay level and when few other TMT members experience similar cuts. I test these predictions on a large longitudinal sample of U.S. firms and find empirical support. These results highlight the importance of temporal comparisons in executive pay evaluation processes.</content>

    <title>Multihoming and single‐homing complementors' responses to intensified between‐platform competition: Evidence from the &lt;scp&gt;YouTube&lt;/scp&gt;–Twitch rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how heterogeneous YouTube content creators‐specifically, single‐homing and multihoming channels‐respond to a sudden increase in the exposure of the rival platform, Twitch. Contrary to expectations, I find that multihoming channels reduce their content creation efforts and underperform relative to single‐homers. To make sense of these surprising results, I develop a formal model that characterizes the strategic behavior of different types of complementors operating across two platforms with varying levels of user exposure. The model offers a plausible explanation for the observed empirical patterns, suggesting that intensified competition between platforms, as a consequence of their changing exposure, disproportionately incentivizes single‐homers to enhance platform value while discouraging multihomers from maintaining the same level of engagement.Managerial SummaryShould platform owners prioritize multihoming or single‐homing complementors? I address this question by analyzing how YouTube and Twitch content creators responded to a sudden rise in Twitch’s exposure following its bundling with Amazon Prime. My analysis reveals that when the focal platform faces minimal competition from other platforms, multihoming creators tend to generate greater value. However, when between‐platform competition for users intensifies, the dynamic reverses: single‐homing creators increase their efforts and outperform their multihoming counterparts. I argue that these patterns stem from the distinct incentive structures that influence content creators’ behavior. These findings imply that the optimal platform strategy is context‐specific and depends on market characteristics such as the intensity of competition between rival platforms.</content>

    <title>A tale of two biases: Unpacking the relationship of overestimation and overprecision on firm performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Overconfidence is widely known to influence firm decision‐making. Yet there remains confusion regarding the concept because it comprises three key aspects: overplacement, overestimation, and overprecision. Using archival data, we employ a firm‐level overconfidence construct to simultaneously analyze the impacts of both overestimation and overprecision. Based on proxies derived from management earnings guidance, overestimation has a sizeable, negative impact on firm performance that is uncorrelated with overprecision's sizeable, positive impact. The result that emerges is surprisingly large: more than one third of a firm's asset value can be explained by these combined facets of overconfidence.Managerial SummaryOverconfidence is well known to executives. It mostly has a bad reputation, but the magnitude of its impact on a firm's strategic decision making is not well known. One aspect of overconfidence is overestimation, which leads to poor forecasts. This leads executives to exaggerate M&amp;A synergies and underestimate the costs as well as the time to complete large capital projects, among other decisions. There is another facet to overconfidence: precision. Overconfidence leads to greater precision in forecasts. In this study, we use corporate earnings guidance. Overprecision in such guidance correlates positively with firm performance. We attribute this result to better investment decisions. We find the combined impact of the positive and negative aspects of overconfidence explains more than a third of a firm's asset value.</content>

    <title>Public support and &lt;scp&gt;VC&lt;/scp&gt; financing in academic startups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate public support and venture capital (VC) investment in academic startups. Government support may enable follow‐on investment by providing a quality signal to investors. This signal is especially important for academic startups, which face large funding gaps due to their complexity, cutting‐edge nature, and uncertainty regarding the founders' management capabilities and commitment. Using a panel of startups in Germany, our analyses confirm that academic startups are more likely to obtain follow‐on VC investment after receiving public support than non‐academic startups. Further, this effect is limited in time, lasts longer for academic startups, is concentrated in high‐tech manufacturing firms, and is stronger for investments from business angels. Our findings have implications for policymakers seeking to foster academic entrepreneurship through policy programs and VC investment.Managerial SummaryObtaining seed and growth capital is essential for potentially highly innovative startups. We show that startups that obtain public support are more likely to receive VC funding and that this effect is stronger for startups with academic founders, approximately twice as large. We further show that this benefit is limited in time, concentrated in the high‐tech manufacturing industry, and more salient for business angel financing than for investment by independent VC funds or corporate VCs. For founders of academic startups, our results imply that acquiring public support might enhance the chances of attracting follow‐on financing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An entrepreneur’s negative attitude toward debt (debt aversion) affects the financing decisions of the businesses they run. Controlling for a range of observable traits, firms run by highly debt-averse entrepreneurs are about 10 percentage points less likely to use debt. The same entrepreneurs are also almost 25% less likely to take up government-guaranteed debt during the COVID-19 crisis. These firms show less interest in COVID-19 support policies if they perceive them to involve debt based on experiments randomizing the framing and labeling of otherwise nearly identical hypothetical COVID-19 support policies as debt or grants.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.

    <title>Getting the Most Out of A/B Tests Using the Asymptotic Minimax-Regret Criteria</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms conduct A/B tests to find a marketing action that improves a value of interest, such as revenue or profit. We develop the asymptotic minimax regret (AMMR) criterion, a practical decision-theoretic approach for choosing among binary marketing actions based on A/B tests. The AMMR is a general large-sample approximation of the minimax-regret criterion from a frequentist standpoint. Our method directly optimizes the decision-relevant metric, accounting for the product of the error probability and the associated magnitude of value loss. Implementing the AMMR decision rule is straightforward; it comprises simply comparing the standardized treatment-effect estimate to the AMMR-optimal decision threshold. The AMMR suggests selecting the treatment whenever the point estimate is positive, as this minimizes the maximum expected net loss from decision errors. A case study of a mobile game company’s A/B testing with Monte Carlo validation demonstrates that the AMMR decision rule effectively selects the optimal marketing action and improves revenue across various data-generating processes.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: K.

    <title>Understanding Talent in Foreign Subsidiaries: A Review, Synthesis, and Way Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations are strategically important, requiring them to tailor their human capital resources to specific needs. Although talent serves as the micro‐level foundation of subsidiaries' organizational‐level human capital resources and strategic outcomes, the current literature is fragmented and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is known, what remains unknown, and what future research should explore about talent in subsidiaries. To this end, we synthesize the literature on talent in subsidiaries over the past two decades, mapping it onto the model of human capital resources emergence. First, we build on existing classifications by integrating the recognized distinction between headquarters‐assigned or locally hired talent with talent nationality, providing a structured perspective that better reflects the realities of subsidiary talent. Second, we examine how talent's individual knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) and social interactions evolve into four subsidiary‐level human capital resources, which in turn contribute to a variety of strategic subsidiary outcomes. Finally, we conclude our review with a future research agenda.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent growth of the digital economy and technological advances has created new patterns of FDI and international involvement. We contribute to the debate on nontraditional (NT) entry modes in a changing digital world—virtual presence, digital platforms, and innovation outposts. We provide fresh insights into real option theory (ROT) and MNE theory, explaining new forms of international involvement within a dynamic ROT portfolio perspective. We discuss uncertainty and correlation among market conditions, knowledge redundancy, how NT modes entail MNE growth and switching options, and how they contribute to the MNE option portfolio. We discussinformation optionsand other real options embedded in NT modes, and the factors influencing their values. Our article has practical relevance as many MNEs do not incorporate real options into their decision-making processes. We encourage managers to understand that (1) uncertainty influences options beneficially, (2) NT modes create real options, and (3) these NT options create flexibility. Our ROT ‘portfolio’ perspective shows how uncertainty, market correlation, and knowledge diversity influence a real option’s contribution to MNE option portfolios, though they are context-specific. Finally, we compare how ROT insights complement those from existing MNE theories.</content>

    <title>Interactivity and Illusions of Ability: How Using Generative AI Affects Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I use the setting of generative AI (GenAI) to examine how processing tool interactivity affects investors’ self‐assessments of ability and willingness to invest. Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do consumers listen to peers during consumption? On emerging digital platforms, real-time comments embedded within content—such as books or videos—allow users to observe others’ spontaneous reactions while engaging with the same material. Using data from a leading Chinese online reading platform, we develop a Bayesian learning model to quantify how these in-consumption comments help users learn book quality and make sequential chapter-by-chapter purchase decisions. Results show that not all comments are viewed equally: those reflecting plot-based insight or strong narrative engagement enhance perceived quality, whereas speculative or even purely cheerful comments may diminish it. Comment consistency—not just volume—plays a critical role in sustaining user engagement. For authors, stabilizing chapter quality and adopting informative chapter titles can encourage continuous reading. Platforms, in turn, can boost retention by encouraging consistent contributions of “favorable” in-consumption comments—those providing scene-based insights, character evaluations, or pleas for new chapters.</content>

    <title>Perceptions of knowledge transferability and entrepreneurial entry: The role of firm‐initiated turnover</title>

      <name>Bukky Akinsanmi Oyedeji</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine the understudied effects of perceived non‐transferable knowledge on labor market choices after firm‐initiated turnover. Using a large, nationally representative dataset, I assess how workers' perceptions of knowledge transferability, expectations to remain at a firm, and type of turnover experienced correlate with the decision to engage in entrepreneurship. I find that the release of workers with perceived non‐transferable knowledge into the external environment through firm‐initiated turnover reliably foreshadows entrepreneurship, especially as workers' prior expectations to continue wage employment at a source firm increases. This finding indicates that beyond necessity, opportunity and financial resources, workers' self‐perceptions of their human capital and unfulfilled career expectations matter to the choice of entrepreneurship. It also suggests that firm‐initiated turnover may be a form of knowledge divestiture with important ex‐post implications when workers' perceptions of transferability align with reality.Managerial SummaryManagers often overlook the role of employees' self‐perceptions in shaping post‐turnover career decisions. This study highlights that workers who perceive their knowledge as non‐transferable—skills and expertise they believe cannot easily be applied to other employers—are more likely to pursue entrepreneurship following firm‐initiated turnover. This trend is particularly pronounced among workers who expected to remain in wage employment but were unexpectedly terminated. Firm‐initiated turnover, while serving to shed human capital, can inadvertently encourage the creation of entrepreneurial ventures that may compete with the firm. To mitigate unintended outcomes, firms should (a) recognize the strategic implications of firm‐initiated turnover as a form of knowledge divestiture, with implications for both the firm and the broader market, (b) reevaluate how they manage exits for employees with the firm's specialized knowledge, to reduce the risk of competitive ventures, and (c) engage in open dialogue to align employee expectations with organizational strategies, considering retention or redeployment options for those at risk of a forced exit. By understanding how workers' perceptions and unmet expectations influence their career paths, firms can make more informed decisions about human capital management and turnover strategies, potentially reducing unintended competitive risks while fostering long‐term relationships with former employees.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from over 2,000 professionals in 24 large corporations in Türkiye, we explore the relationship between female leadership and the relational culture in the workplace. First, we document that although male and female leaders possess equal cognitive capacity, they diverge in socioemotional characteristics. Next, we show that the relational dynamics in the workplace are different under male and female leadership. Male employees form homophilic professional ties under male leadership, whereas we observe less gender-segregated networks under female leadership, where both males and females establish more links with their female colleagues. Female employees receive more support from their leaders and are less likely to quit under female leadership. However, female employees working under female leaders report worse workplace satisfaction and meritocracy. Delving into the mechanisms reveals that female employees depict a gloomier workplace climate in the absence of social support from their female leader. Overall, our findings highlight the influential role of social support from leaders and suggest that increasing supportive female presence in leadership positions may be an effective way to foster a more inclusive relational culture in the workplace.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Science Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy [Grant EXC 2126/1–390838866].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05507 .</content>

    <title>Owner Support for Green Shareholder Voting and Divestment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the preferences of 10,000 capital owners worldwide, including nearly 3,000 from the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, regarding green shareholder voting and divestment. Findings indicate substantial support (53%–72%) for shareholder engagement and green voting, which is more popular and less politically divisive than divestment. Preferences for green voting increase with the likelihood of green outcomes being implemented though 63% of the payoff is attributed to expressive benefits. These results suggest that shareholder engagement and green voting could play a central role in a broader climate strategy portfolio.This paper was accepted by Caroline Flammer, sustainability.Funding: This work was supported by The Norwegian Finance Market Fund (Finansmarkedsfondet).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08186 .</content>

    <title>Do Households React to Monetary Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how households understand and respond to monetary policy by exploiting the open auctions of early-stage crowdfunding and inferring individuals’ expectations based on their maximum requested interest rates. Using loan listings from Prosper, we find that borrowers adjust their willingness-to-pay interest rates in response to unexpected Federal funds rate changes, whereas anticipated shifts have negligible effects. These responses are more pronounced among high-income, high-credit-score borrowers; large loan applicants; and when Federal Reserve communication is transparent. The responses are highly asymmetric—Borrowers sharply lower rates during unexpected easing but resist increasing them during unexpected tightening. The results are robust to alternative specifications, including regression-discontinuity-in-time designs and alternative measures of monetary policy shock. Lenders also respond to policy shocks and counteract borrowers’ adjustments. Analysis of Robinhood data shows that retail investors mirror this behavior by reducing equity holdings after surprise rate hikes.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the general research fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong [Grant 17504925], the Dean’s Research Fund of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, The Education University of Hong Kong [Grant FLASS/DRF 04635], the Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology [Grant FRG-24-019-MSB], the Seed Funding Grant of EdUHK [Grant 02C11], and the Block Grant Blueprint of EdUHK [Grant 02A23].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04649 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Public and Buyer‐Driven Governance for Supplier Sustainability Development in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments and regulatory agencies in emerging countries are increasingly enforcing labor and environmental protection laws. However, how this growing public governance interrelates with existing buyer‐driven governance to influence supplier sustainability development remains unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal case study involving two rounds of extensive data collection at nine Chinese suppliers of COSMOS, a European multinational company in the consumer electronics industry. We identify three distinctive configurations of how public governance and buyer‐driven governance jointly influence supplier sustainability development. Identifying these configurations builds on prior research that distinguishes between competitive, complementary, and coexistent interactions between public and private governance. We extend this literature by uncovering the causal mechanisms through which each configuration gives rise to a unique sustainability development trajectory. Specifically, we unpack the different elements of each configuration and analyze their influence on suppliers' willingness and ability to pursue sustainability improvement. We conclude by delineating the boundary conditions that define the generalizability of our findings across contexts.</content>

    <title>Bridging the Divide: How Dual‐Background Leaders Unlock Returnee Innovation in Politically Connected Chinese Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how firm leadership diversity influences innovation, focusing on the interplay between returnee leaders – those with international experience – and politically connected leaders. While returnee leaders introduce globally derived innovation practices, their efforts often clash with the state‐aligned agendas of politically connected leaders. By integrating bridging mechanisms into upper echelons theory, we introduce dual‐background leaders – executives with both political and international experience – to bridge these divergent cognitive logics. Through a longitudinal analysis of Chinese publicly listed firms from 2006 to 2016, we find that the positive effect of returnee leaders on innovation performance is significantly weakened in firms with high political connectivity, especially in the absence of dual‐background leaders. Conversely, firms that effectively integrate dual‐background leaders are better positioned to reconcile competing innovation agendas and unlock the synergistic potential of leadership diversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine hidden orders usage by algorithmic traders (ATs) and nonATs. ATs extensively use hidden orders but of smaller size than nonATs, who are the primary contributors to hidden volume. ATs’ relative share of hidden volume decreases with volatility, adverse selection costs, and the relative tick-size. Proprietary ATs (HFTs), who differ from agency ATs (AATs) in their information sets and potential gains from trade, hide orders to reduce competition for liquidity provision, whereas AATs use hidden orders to conceal information in their more informed orders and manage picking-off risk. Finally, superior technology provides limited benefit for hidden order execution.</content>

    <title>The Determinants of ESG Ratings: Rater Ownership Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how common ownership affects Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—an important research question given the increasing use of these ratings in investment decisions and corporate evaluations. We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an asymptotic framework for conducting inference on continuous-time asset pricing models using high-frequency returns over an increasing time horizon. Our study focuses on the identification and estimation of risk premiums associated with the continuous component and jumps of various size brackets. We extend the classical Fama-MacBeth regression from the discrete-time setting to a continuous-time factor model, incorporating general dynamics for factors, idiosyncratic components, and factor loadings. Our empirical analysis of U.S. equities, foreign exchange, and commodities underscores the distinct significance of continuous and jump risk premiums for the specific factors constructed within each asset class in determining expected returns.</content>

    <title>Incentive alignment in ecosystems: The role of complementarity types and multi‐sided bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alignment of incentives to improve value creation in ecosystems is crucial to their growth and survival. We examine how two fundamental ecosystem features affect alignment: types of complementarities and their interplay with multi‐sided bargaining over value. Using a formal model, we find that multi‐sided bargaining typically causes misalignment, in patterns that vary dramatically depending on the type of complementarities. For instance, we find that multiplicative complementarities typically entail weak alignment among participants. In contrast, when value creation is constrained by the weakest component, alignment can be alternatively very strong or very weak. We also find that the starting levels of participants' functionality matter. This suggests new avenues for assessing ecosystem performance and the potential for alignment among participants.Managerial SummaryManagers of firms operating in ecosystems need to understand the factors that make their partners aligned with the objective of increasing the ecosystem's value creation. Our research shows that, under multi‐sided bargaining, a major driver of incentive alignment is the type of complementarity between ecosystem's components, that is, how the different pieces of the ecosystem contribute to value creation. Depending on the complementarity type (multiplicative, additive, and weakest‐link), and ecosystem partners' starting levels of functionalities, we show which combinations are intrinsically favorable for aligning development incentives and which ones may undermine alignment. These findings can serve as a guide to diagnose the potential for misalignment among ecosystem partners and how much value creation is at stake.</content>

    <title>Mobilizing the silent majority: Discourse broadening and audience support for entrepreneurial innovations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs operating in a public interactional domain face a unique communicative challenge: they must leverage conversations with a small subset of vocal discursive partners to mobilize support from a broader base of silent audiences observing these exchanges. I propose that entrepreneurs who engage with these vocal discursive partners using what I refer to asdiscourse broadeningare more likely to successfully gain support from the broader silent audience. Using a computational linguistics model to analyze discourses on an online platform featuring entrepreneurial innovations, this study finds an inverted U‐shaped relationship between discourse broadening and support from silent audience members. This relationship is moderated by the similarity between the interpretative lenses of discursive partners and silent audience members, which influences the trade‐off between the benefits and costs of discourse broadening.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face the critical challenge of persuading broader audiences to support their novel ideas despite having limited opportunities to interact with them directly. This article examines how entrepreneurs can strategically engage with their immediate conversational partners on online platforms to gain support from a wider base of silent observers. The findings show that entrepreneurs must carefully balance the extent to which they broaden the discourse with their conversational partners to maximize support from the broader audience. They also need to tailor the level of discourse broadening based on how much their conversational partners represent the views of silent observers. These insights reveal a discursive strategy that entrepreneurs can leverage on online platforms to increase the likelihood of success in commercializing their innovations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human decision-makers frequently override the recommendations generated by predictive algorithms, but it is unclear whether these discretionary overrides add valuable private information or reintroduce human biases and mistakes. We develop new quasi-experimental tools to measure the impact of human discretion over an algorithm on the accuracy of decisions, even when the outcome of interest is only selectively observed, in the context of bail decisions. We find that 90% of the judges in our setting underperform the algorithm when they make a discretionary override, with most making override decisions that are no better than random. Yet the remaining 10% of judges outperform the algorithm in terms of both accuracy and fairness when they make a discretionary override. We provide suggestive evidence on the behavior underlying these differences in judge performance, showing that the high-performing judges are more likely to use relevant private information and are less likely to overreact to highly salient events compared to the low-performing judges.</content>

    <title>A double-edged sword: materiality classifications of sustainability topics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has classified sustainability topics as material or not material for investors. We leverage the staggered release of the SASB classifications from 2013 to 2016 to examine whether and how they prompt changes in U.S. firms’ sustainability performance. We measure sustainability performance using RepRisk scores, which reflect environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incidents. We find that RepRisk scores on sustainability topics classified as material decrease following the release of SASB classifications. Conversely, incident scores on nonmaterial sustainability topics increase. This suggests that firms improve their sustainability performance on topics the SASB deems relevant for investors while simultaneously performing worse on irrelevant topics. Firms adjust their internal sustainability policies to mirror these changes. The changes in sustainability performance occur primarily through two channels. We document that higher exposure to the classifications from shareholder pressure and sustainability-linked executive compensation prompts managers to prioritize sustainability topics classified as relevant for investors over irrelevant ones.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a field experiment, we find that a mandatory mentorship program raises worker productivity, whereas a voluntary version of the program does not. A significant reason why the mandatory program results in larger gains is that the lowest-productivity employees do not participate when the program is voluntary despite their having the greatest treatment benefits. A nationally representative survey of U.S. workers shows wide variation in human capital development program participation, suggesting that understanding self-selection is important for firms’ returns on these programs across a variety of settings. Our findings have implications for resource allocation, experimental design, productivity dispersion, and inequality.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07524 .</content>

    <title>How Middle Managers Affect Frontline Idea Generation: Evidence From Healthcare Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This multiple case study develops a mid‐range theory on how frontline idea generation is affected by the actions of an organization's middle management. The study draws from four acute‐care hospitals in Germany and involves 36 semi‐structured interviews with representatives from all hierarchy levels. We use mission statements from these hospitals to measure top management's strategic intent regarding frontline idea generation. Then we analyze the idea generation performance of 156 nurses from the hospitals and link it to specific middle management behaviors. The cross‐case analyses reveal that middle managers' shaping of nurses' innovation identity improves nurses' idea generation performance. However, this connection also means that middle managers' own forays into innovation can impede frontline idea generation. We find that middle managers' supportive behavior is largely independent of top management intent, a dynamic that offers both advantages and risks. These insights extend our knowledge about the role of middle managers in frontline idea generation.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Temporal Patterns of New Product Introductions and IPO Value: The Importance of Recency, Dispersion, and Asymmetry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s innovation activity is often judged by the number and type of new products it launches, butwhenthese products are introduced may be equally important, especially before going public. This research investigates how the temporal pattern of new product introductions (NPIs) influences a firm’s initial public offering (IPO) value. The analysis uses data from 298 firms that went public between 2006 and 2023, and focuses on three patterns of timing: recency (how recently the latest product was launched before the IPO), dispersion (the degree to which NPIs before the IPO are spread out over time), and asymmetry (how disproportionately NPIs were launched over time before the IPO). Results demonstrate that firms with more dispersed NPIs achieve higher IPO value, whereas firms that introduce a product just before the IPO or introduce several new products disproportionately closer to the IPO tend to perform worse. Findings show that 1% increases in recency, dispersion, or asymmetry result in a 1.34% decrease, 3.65% increase, and 1.03% decrease, respectively, in IPO value, and these vary depending on the firm’s industry growth and product innovativeness. Results provide new insights for theory and practice, highlighting that innovation timing is a key determinant of IPO performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Psychological Ownership and Territorial Behaviors in Rental Transactions: Why “Who” You Rent from Matters</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The phenomenal growth in rentals, with the advent of access-based platforms, has made it possible for consumers to rent products from person providers (e.g., Alex on Airbnb) and company providers (e.g., Apex Vacations on Airbnb). But does “who” a consumer rents from matter? Across nine experiments (including one with real behaviors), we demonstrate that despite the product being the same, consumers differ in how they feel about the product depending on “who” they are renting from. Consumers feel stronger psychological ownership for the product when renting from company providers than person providers. These feelings of psychological ownership drive consumers to engage in “territorial” behaviors – actions that assert their claim on the rented product (e.g., moving furniture in a rental cabin). Consequently, consumers are more willing to exhibit such behaviors when renting from company providers than person providers. These behaviors impose real costs on rental providers through increased operational burdens and property damage, as exemplified through additional analyses of providers’comments on Airbnb’s community platform and interviews with providers. We further identify strategies to mitigate consumers’ territorial behaviors by altering consumers’ feelings of psychological ownership through its antecedent in the rental context: provider’s connection to the rental product.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores U.S. public firms’ cryptocurrency holdings and accounting practices from 2013 to 2022 against the backdrop of the recently enacted crypto accounting rule, ASU 2023‐08. Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manipulated consumer reviews are a growing concern for digital platforms, undermining trust and distorting market outcomes. This study analyzes data from the Apple App Store to assess how both positive and negative manipulated reviews—later filtered by the platform—affect app sales rankings. Surprisingly, both one-star and five-star manipulated reviews initially boost app rankings, even when one-star reviews are intended to harm competitors. These effects can persist for weeks and take up to six months to reverse through platform filtering. Using text analysis, we find that negative manipulated reviews are linguistically more distinguishable from organic ones than are positive manipulated reviews, making them easier for consumers to spot. Our results show that review volume often outweighs valence in influencing consumer behavior, and that manipulated reviews have stronger effects on free apps, gaming apps, and apps from large developers. These findings underscore the urgency for platform managers to invest in faster, more accurate filtering systems, and highlight the need for policymakers to strengthen governance mechanisms to protect marketplace integrity and consumer trust.</content>

    <title>Transferring, Eliminating, or Both? The Strategic Impact of Resale Platforms and Consumer Learning on Coping with Consumer Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For sellers of experience goods, consumer uncertainty threatens profits. Resale platforms and enhanced consumer learning are popular tools to manage this uncertainty, but their impacts differ significantly and require tailored strategies. Our research reveals critical nuances overlooked by prior studies: the resale platform’s negative effect is often underestimated because of its indirect influence on consumer waiting behavior, whereas consumer learning can harm sellers of high-cost goods when consumers are impatient. Critically, the profitability and environmental outcomes depend on production costs and consumer patience. Encouraging consumer learning creates a profit-environment win–win with patient consumers, whereas resale platforms excel with impatient consumers and high costs. Combining both mechanisms benefits sellers only when consumers are patient and costs are moderate ([Formula: see text]"). Key strategic imperatives emerge: (i) resale behavior: encourage selectively (beneficial mainly for high-cost goods), minimizing resale discounts; (ii) learning behavior: nurture consumer patience and avoid rushing purchases, especially for premium goods; and (iii) product upgrades: avoid frequent, minor updates. Sellers must move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches, aligning their uncertainty management (resale, learning, upgrades) with product economics and consumer patience to optimize profits and sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The study of nascent entrepreneurship lies at the core of entrepreneurship scholarship, offering critical insights into how both entrepreneurs and ventures emerge through a contextually embedded process. This review synthesizes findings from 95 peer-reviewed articles that employ the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), two comprehensive longitudinal datasets specifically focusing on nascent entrepreneurship. Using thematic analysis, we synthesize the literature into three core dimensions—the entrepreneur, the entrepreneurial process, and the venture—and emphasize the role of context. Although research on individuals and ventures is relatively well developed, the process dimension remains underexplored, and contextual influences warrant further investigation. We also identify key methodological challenges—particularly related to construct validity—as well as emerging methodological innovations. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, underscoring the need for more large-scale initiatives and opportunities to re-engage with the PSED’s untapped potential to advance understanding of entrepreneurial emergence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study adopts a Bourdieusian lens to examine how founders’ social class origin influences venture performance through a central aspect of entrepreneurial habitus—risk-taking. In Study 1, we find that risk-taking mediates the relationship between social class origin and venture performance, advantaging those from higher social class origins. In an archival dataset, we show that an alternative measure of childhood social class similarly predicts risk-taking among self-employed individuals. In Study 2, we investigate how field-specific social capital moderates this pathway through founders’ social networks. These findings advance understanding of how early-life social class conditions shape entrepreneurial behavior and performance and imply the need for more nuanced and class-inclusive support within entrepreneurial ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether the interplay of social comparisons in housing and rising income inequality contributed to the household debt boom in the United States between 1980 and 2007. We develop a tractable macroeconomic model with general social comparisons in housing to show that changes in the distribution of income affect aggregate housing demand, aggregate debt, and house prices if (and only if) social comparisons are asymmetric. In the empirically relevant case of upward-looking comparisons, rising inequality can rationalize a substantial share of the observed housing and debt boom.

    <title>A Walrasian Mechanism with Markups for Nonconvex Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce markup equilibrium—an extension of Walrasian equilibrium in which consumers pay a fixed percentage markup over producer prices. In quasilinear markets, markup equilibria exist despite nonconvexities. They are resource-feasible and envy-free, incur no budget deficit, and require little more communication and computation than ordinary Walrasian equilibrium. The associated markup mechanism is asymptotically incentive-compatible. We also introduce a Bound-Form First Welfare Theorem, which states that for any feasible allocation, the welfare loss compared to the first-best is bounded, using any price vector, by the sum of the resulting (i) budget surplus and (ii) rationing losses suffered by the participants. Using producer prices, this bound implies that any markup equilibrium with a small markup and few unallocated goods is nearly efficient.</content>

    <title>Auditor-provided nonpublic signals of misreporting and CFO dismissal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research suggests that board members value financial reporting quality because executive dismissal often follows low reporting quality events. However, inferences about the board’s demand for reporting quality in these studies are confounded by board members’ reputation incentives because the events examined are public (e.g., restatements). We investigate boards’ demand for reporting quality by exploiting aprivatesignal of misreporting: audit adjustments communicated to the Board by the external auditor. We first survey 29 audit committee chairs to understand whether boards use audit adjustments in their oversight of management and then conduct an empirical investigation to answer our research question. We find an increased likelihood of CFO dismissal following audit adjustments. This association is driven by adjustments that reduce income and by firms with better board oversight. These findings suggest that boards proactively use nonpublic signals of reporting quality and incorporate information from auditors into their monitoring function.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Facilitating Review Information Disclosure in the Platform Economy: Is More Accurate Always Better?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online consumer reviews (OCRs) publicly disclose consumer uncertainty about product valuations, enabling firms to acquire more accurate demand information. This paper develops a game-theoretic model in which a manufacturer sells products through both physical stores and a third-party online platform, which may operate in reselling or agency business modes. We investigate the interplay between OCR disclosure and business mode choices. We find that the manufacturer and the platform generally share aligned interests in OCR disclosure across business modes, with the information value of OCRs shaped by their accuracy and the uncertainty of consumers regarding product valuations. Specifically, OCR disclosure benefits both parties, yet it leads to higher gains for the manufacturer than the platform in the reselling mode, whereas their profit gains depend on the commission rate in the agency mode. When either consumer uncertainty about product valuations or the accuracy of OCRs is relatively low, both parties prefer the agency mode if the commission rate is moderate or the reselling mode if it is sufficiently high. When both consumer uncertainty about product valuations and the accuracy of OCRs are sufficiently high, both parties prefer the agency mode only if the commission rate is sufficiently high. Notably, the effects of OCR disclosure on the equilibrium business mode selection are non-monotonic: More accurate OCR disclosure facilitates the realization of an equilibrium business mode when the initial accuracy of OCRs is low and inhibits it when their accuracy is high. Last, we find that limited disclosure of OCRs and an endogenous commission rate can be employed as strategic tools to align business mode preferences. Our findings caution against the assumption that full OCR disclosure uniformly benefits platforms and manufacturers, and we offer practical insights for the design and operation of review systems.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Portfolio Allocation Under Market Incompleteness and Wealth Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dynamic Portfolio Allocation Under Market Incompleteness and Wealth EffectsIn the paper “Dynamic portfolio allocation under market incompleteness and wealth effects,” a novel decomposition of an optimal dynamic portfolio is developed under general incomplete-market models and the wealth-dependent hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility. It shows that with hedgeable interest rate risk, the optimal portfolio consists of two parts: a pure constant relative risk aversion optimal portfolio and a financing bond portfolio for investor future subsistence requirements. Under such a structure, the wealth growth rate is always higher for HARA investors with more initial wealth, leading to increased wealth inequality regardless of the underlying model dynamics and realized market scenario. Using the decomposition, the authors solve the HARA optimal policy in closed form under an incomplete-market model with both stochastic interest rate and volatility. The wealth effect in the optimal portfolio has interesting implications. It generates a procyclical pattern in investor stock positions and time-varying risk aversion levels as well as a “buy high, sell low” market timing effect that may hurt HARA investors with low initial wealth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper shows that competing firms with competitive advantages in distinct attributes can credibly coordinate their messaging about attribute importance, reducing consumer uncertainty and generating category demand. A truthful equilibrium arises in which each firm highlights the more important attribute—even when at a disadvantage—but such an equilibrium does not exist without competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the estimation of dynamic economic models for which some of the state variables are observed only occasionally by the econometrician—a common problem in many fields, ranging from marketing to finance to industrial organization. If those occasional state observations are serially correlated, the likelihood function of the model becomes a high-dimensional integral over a nonstandard domain. We generalize the recursive likelihood function integration procedure to incorporate the occasional observations, enabling likelihood-based inference in such estimation problems. In extensive Monte Carlo studies, we demonstrate the favorable properties of the proposed method for identifying all model parameters and compare it to alternative methods.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lack of comovement between consumption differentials and real exchange rates is a traditional indicator of a disconnect of foreign exchange markets from economic fundamentals. We present novel empirical evidence for the disconnect between the volatilities, as opposed to the levels, of these variables. The volatility correlations are below one, but they are larger than the level correlations. We discuss the economics of volatility disconnect anomaly in settings with complete and incomplete markets and provide an explanation of our empirical findings based on international risk sharing of expected growth and volatility news shocks.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Health campaigns in firms could be a cost-effective approach to reduce sickness absence and to mitigate negative economic consequences of ill health among employees. Low participation rates, however, may prevent firms from realizing such private economic benefits. Moreover, employees may overestimate the effects of the campaign and engage in risky behaviors that could be detrimental to their health, thereby reducing the potential benefits of the intervention. We ran a natural field experiment with a bank in Ecuador, where we employed a randomized encouragement design by experimentally manipulating incentives to participate in a campaign to get vaccinated against influenza. This allows us to study the determinants of on-site vaccination and the consequences of increased participation in a firm campaign for employees, thereby informing about the private incentives for firms to run such interventions. Using rich administrative records merged with employee survey data, we find strong evidence that opportunity costs to participate in the campaign and peer behavior in the firm matter to increase vaccination take-up. Contrary to the firm’s expectation, increased participation in the campaign did not imply reduced sickness absence during the flu season. As we observe no relevant health benefits or externalities via coworker vaccination, our comprehensive analyses indicate that the campaign most likely was not economically beneficial for the firm. We discuss potential explanations for this result and present evidence consistent with the notion that a vaccination campaign can influence the behavior of employees concerning their health.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04908 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document a pecking order of transaction costs in the interdealer market for German sovereign bonds, where three trading protocols coexist. Dealers can trade over the counter (OTC), either bilaterally or via brokers, as well as on an exchange. Trading on the exchange is more expensive than OTC, and broker-intermediated trades are more costly than bilateral OTC trades. The existence of an OTC discount is difficult to square with theories centered around search-and-bargaining frictions but is in line with models of hybrid markets based on information frictions. Consistently, we show that dealers’ information impacts their choice of trading protocol and that the pecking order of transaction costs is aligned with the informational content of order flows across protocols. Search and bargaining as well as information proxies explain differences in OTC discount within protocols. A realistic description of hybrid markets thus requires both types of frictions.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: L. Pelizzon and M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the influence of supply chains on the transmission of financial shocks to firms’ innovation. Using matched Italian firm-bank data over the 2007–2017 period, we find that firms’ engagement in supply chains enhanced the resilience of innovation activities to the banking shock caused by the “twin financial crises” (Great Financial Crisis and sovereign debt crisis). The results suggest that, amid the banking shock, supply chains facilitated purchases of innovative intermediates through trade credit provision and helped to sustain firms’ joint research and development efforts. The estimates imply, however, that the support offered by supply chains did not extend to radical product advances.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03601 .</content>

    <title>It's Not Just What You Say, but How You Say It: The Effects of Enterprise Social Media on Service Management, Through the Lens of Signaling Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Frontline service workers are crucial to service delivery and have been a long‐standing focus of research, with scholars and practitioners alike maintaining an interest in their effective management. As technology increasingly transforms this context, the way in which managers in service organizations communicate with frontline workers has also evolved, with a notable increase in the use of enterprise social media (ESM). This study investigates the idea that it is not just ‘what’ management says (service‐oriented messaging) but ‘the way’ they say it (via ESM) that matters. Drawing on interviews with 36 informants and guided by signaling theory, this study explores how ESM influences customer‐focused signaling via management communication and HR implementation in the frontline service context, fostering conditions for a service climate. Findings reveal that ESM's affordances can potentially enhance service climate by strengthening HR system strength, promoting voice, and fostering informal leadership. However, risks such as manager role ambiguity, perceptions of mixed messaging, and over‐surveillance are also identified. This study highlights the double‐edged implications of ESM in its shaping of service‐oriented signaling and emphasizes the importance of the signaling environment in realizing its benefits while mitigating its risks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances real options reasoning (ROR) logics by examining how entrepreneurs make sequential decisions under varying uncertainty. Although ROR has been conceptualized as a useful decision-making framework, its boundary conditions and theoretical applications remain underspecified. Through a multistage experimental design with 181 entrepreneurs and an archival study, we demonstrate that entrepreneurs employ different ROR logics based on both the initial level of uncertainty and its subsequent directional changes. This advances ROR by establishing its boundary conditions, demonstrating when entrepreneurs do and do not employ ROR logics, and revealing how the directionality and magnitude of uncertainty changes influence entrepreneurial decision-making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how firms should allocate their inventors to network locations to achieve their best innovation performance. We use an NK model to model the interactions between key factors that influence a firm's innovation: (a) individuals' embeddedness within the firm's network, (b) individuals' heterogeneity across their search distance as well as their adoption (i.e., imitation) propensity, and (c) the complexity of the firm's landscape. We find that in high‐complexity landscapes, firms benefit from allocating low‐adopter agents to the core and high‐adopters to the periphery, thereby promoting more independent search at the core. The opposite is true for low complexity landscapes. We further find that when agent types are unknown, individuals should be allocated based on their adoption propensity versus search distance.Managerial SummaryWhere should firms locate their heterogeneous inventors within their networks? Simulating a complex innovation landscape, our study focuses on the interaction of three essential factors that may influence firms' innovation: the location of inventors in the core (embedded position) or periphery of a firm's structure, the distance inventors search for solutions, and the adoption propensity with which inventors will imitate their peers' solutions versus being independent and following their own trajectory. Our results show that firms benefit by placing independent searchers who also search far at the core of the firm when facing highly complex problems, and at the periphery otherwise. Though search distance and adoption propensity have substitutive effects on innovation performance, firms should allocate based on inventors' adoption propensity to lower innovation‐performance variance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study repurchase options (repo contracts) in a competitive asset market with adverse selection. Gains from trade emerge from a liquidity need, but private information about asset quality prevents the full realization of trades. In equilibrium, a single repo contract pools all assets. The embedded repurchase option mitigates adverse selection by improving the volume of trades relative to outright sales. However, liquidity provision can be inefficiently low as lenders compete to attract high-quality assets via high haircuts and low rates. The equilibrium has a closed form and aligns well with empirical patterns across Mortgage-Backed Securities repos.</content>

    <title>To Each Their Own: Personalized Product Offerings in Competition</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study competition between two firms that personalize product offerings to consumers. Firms have private, imperfect signals of each consumer’s ideal location and offer each consumer a different product without observing the competitor’s product offering. We characterize the equilibrium personalization strategy and examine how the accuracies of firms’ signals affect equilibrium strategy, profits, and consumer welfare. A firm generally charges a higher price for a more niche product and profits more from niche consumers unless its prediction accuracy is sufficiently lower than its competitor’s. When both firms have the same industry-level prediction accuracy, an increase in accuracy initially relaxes but later intensifies price competition for niche consumers, having the opposite effect on mainstream consumers. Interestingly, equilibrium profits also have an inverse-U shape in the prediction accuracy. A higher accuracy can also decrease welfare for mainstream consumers. When firms can endogenously invest in prediction accuracy, firms have incentives to overinvest in equilibrium, resulting in a prisoner’s dilemma. Privacy regulations that reduce predictive accuracy, including industry self-regulation, could improve profits and hurt consumer welfare by relaxing price competition. Our results remain robust under consumer search. The paper also discusses what happens if firms charge uniform pricing, if consumers’ ideal locations are distributed on the Salop circle, or if firms receive common signals, highlighting price discrimination between mainstream and niche consumers as the key driver of results.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce formal measures for two psychological factors of probabilistic risk attitudes: attractiveness (motivational factor) and discriminability (cognitive factor). Unlike previous approaches that relied on heuristic proxies, our measures precisely capture these two fundamental factors. Our measures are mathematically tractable, robust to discontinuities, such as in the NEO-additive case, and flexible to be applied to any weighting function, as well as to both small and large probabilities. Additionally, through detailed numerical analysis, we examine to what extent existing weighting function parameters capture the two factors: attractiveness and discriminability. Finally, using these new measures, we provide a formal understanding of the independence between motivational and cognitive factors.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The research was made possible by the financial support from Brazilian Agency of Research and Innovation (Finep), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [Grants PROJ–CAPES PRINT 1033427P] and PUC-Rio.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04870 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Limit orders submitted around the same time are subject to random latencies and will be queued accordingly. In equilibrium, end-of-queue limit orders always lose money—the liquidity supply appears excessive. The model generates empirical predictions regarding such “overshooting” liquidity: (i) new limit orders appear fleeting—clustered submissions are followed by immediate cancellations, (ii) the resulting cancel-to-add count ratio reflects adverse selection, and (iii) the cancel-to-add size ratio measures high-frequency market-making activity. Welfare can be hurt by the overshooting liquidity if it induces excessive speculation. Overall, the model contributes to a more comprehensive understanding and better utilization of order book data.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The supplementary appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03371 .</content>

    <title>Addressing Gender in Authenticity and Inclusion at Work: Nuancing Conservation of Resources Theory With Social Role Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we elucidate how gender may influence the mechanisms and conditions under which perceived inclusion climate facilitates authenticity at work. We nuance conservation of resources theory with social role theory to argue that perceived inclusion climate acts as a caravan passageway through which authenticity at work can be fostered, yet how inclusion climate relates to authenticity is different for men versus for women. We hypothesize that men will feel more authentic when they perceive their organization to be inclusive because such perceptions enable them to feel unique, whereas women will feel more authentic when in inclusive organizations because such environments foster their belongingness. In a time‐lagged study, we find that for women, it is belongingness that is the mediating process, whereas for men, it is both uniqueness and belongingness. We additionally propose, and find, that structural empowerment, as an HRM contextual resource caravan, moderates the relationships between perceived inclusion climate and belongingness/uniqueness for women but not for men. Here, structural empowerment is particularly important for women's needs for belongingness and uniqueness when they perceive their organization be not very inclusive. Overall, we contribute to workplace inclusion and authenticity literatures by underscoring the need to consider gender differences in more depth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professional house price forecast data are consistent with a rational model where agents must learn about the parameters of the house price growth process and the underlying state of the housing market. Slow learning about the long-run mean generates overreaction to forecast revisions and a modest response of forecasts to lagged realizations. Heterogeneity in signals and priors about the long-run mean helps the model account for cross-sectional dispersion in forecasts. Introducing behavioral frictions helps improve the model’s predictions for short-horizon overreaction and dispersion. Using a cross-section of forecasters and a term structure of forecasts are crucial for inference. (JEL C32, D84, G41, R32)</content>

    <title>Status-Amplified Deterrence: Paul Manafort’s Prosecution Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social control agents often struggle to deter organizational deviance. We propose a theory of “status-amplified deterrence” wherein enforcement’s deterrent effects are amplified when carried out against high-status organizational actors. First, this enforcement is interpreted as willingness and ability for far-reaching enforcement. Next, amplified deterrence occurs as these episodes become widely known through (1) extensive media coverage and (2) the marketing efforts of third-party compliance advisors. We examine this theory in the context of the U.S. Department of Justice’s enforcement against Paul Manafort for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that enforcement against Manafort caused a widespread, sustained, and economically significant reduction in FARA noncompliance. We show supplementary evidence consistent with the idea that deterrence was amplified in significant part by media attention and by law firms referencing the episode while successfully marketing FARA advisory services. We contribute to literature illuminating how organizations, in conjunction with third-party compliance advisors, adjust deviant activities in response to shifting regulatory environments.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18754 .</content>

    <title>Rethinking the Value and Emission Implications of Green Bonds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our analysis of green bonds issued between 2013 and 2022 reveals a distinctive shareholder preference for such assets, particularly among financial institutions. In the secondary market, the green bonds issued by financial firms’ trade at a “greenium” of 8.2 basis points compared with matched samples, which is attributed potentially to the financial firms’ efforts in channeling funds to green loans. Past work documenting a positive stock price reaction to the issuance of green bonds is isolated to financial firms and to specific issuers. Issuers of green bonds with higher emissions before the green bond issue report an insignificant reduction in such emissions after issuance. Our analysis of the sustainable lending practices of these gatekeepers reveals that the greenium earned in the green bond market does not translate to the green loan market. Furthermore, the borrowers’ performance remains unchanged in the short term, indicating a lack of due diligence by the gatekeepers. This study underscores the complex relationship between financial markets and environmental stewardship.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial assistance from Columbia Business School, Fordham University, Harvard University (Program on Corporate Governance), and MIT Sloan (Sustainability Initiative).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00961 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Comparative Analysis of FLE Wellness Benefits and Customer Responsiveness: A Social Exchange Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the importance of frontline employees (FLEs) for organizations and consumers, it is important to motivate them to achieve optimal performance. One way to motivate FLEs is through employer-provided wellness benefits, which might increase FLEs’ responsiveness to customer needs. Building on social exchange theory, this research simultaneously examines five different wellness benefits to identify factors that can enhance FLEs’ feelings of being valued and an induced sense of indebtedness, which in turn can have downstream effects on customer responsiveness. The results of five studies, including a pilot study, preliminary sales study, field studies, and an internal meta-analysis, demonstrate how food and social benefits exert the strongest effects, with food yielding stronger direct effects on customer responsiveness and both showing indirect effects through value and indebtedness feelings. The next strongest effects are from mindfulness benefits. Physical and health wellness benefits exert the weakest downstream consequences. Importantly, if FLEs are in a supportive work environment, the effects of food and social benefits are enhanced. Conversely, job stressors and motivational constructs do not significantly impact the effects of employer-provided wellness benefits. By adopting the provided recommendations, retailers and service providers can institute effective and optimal wellness programs to enhance their FLEs’ customer-facing behaviors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers demonstrate a preference for products with glossy surfaces. This research examines how and why product glossiness influences consumers’ product preference in the first-hand versus second-hand markets. Six studies demonstrate that consumers generally prefer products with a glossy, as opposed to a matte, surface in both first-hand and second-hand markets. The preference for product glossiness is driven by the heightened recency (pristineness) perception of glossy products in the first-hand (second-hand) market. In addition, in line with these mechanisms, the positive effect of product glossiness on consumer preference is reversed for time-enhanced products (i.e., product quality and value improve with age) in the first-hand market and diminished when diagnostic prior product usage information is available to consumers in the second-hand market. Findings in this research contribute to a deeper understanding of visual marketing and product newness by verifying how visual glossiness induces two different interpretations of product newness in the first-hand and second-hand markets. This research offers practical implications for product design and presentation in the first-hand market, as well as refurbishing and resale strategies in the second-hand market, suggesting ways to communicate a consistent brand image and enhance product preference more effectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how deskilling technology (map apps) affects the choice of individuals to provide ride‐hail service. In a vignette experiment, technology increased participation in work by 8% and 4% among low‐ and high‐skill drivers respectively. Technology can increase participation by raising productivity or affording an amenity (reducing disutility of work). A field experiment revealed that the technology afforded more amenity to low‐skill drivers and they incurred more stress when driving without technology. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce wage pressures.Managerial SummaryTechnologies that deskill work may afford an amenity by reducing the disutility of work. In formulating technology strategy, managers must consider how the amenity varies by worker skill and how it affects the supply of labor. In the context of ride‐hail drivers, we show that navigation technology affords an amenity. The amenity is larger and the effect of technology on increasing labor supply is more pronounced among drivers with less skill. Strategically, the amenity is important as it may reduce pressures for higher wages from low‐skilled workers.</content>

    <title>On the Optimal Design of a Financial Stability Fund</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of a Financial Stability Fund (the “Fund” henceforth) for a union of sovereign countries. By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.</content>

    <title>Complementarity in Future Selves: How Networks of Future-Oriented Cognitive Representations Influence Individuals’ Ability to Proactively and Adaptively Manage Their Career</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When thinking about one’s future work life and career with its seemingly endless possibilities, individuals rarely have a singular “put together” vision of their future self, in which all components neatly fit together. We investigate how the complementarity of a future self impacts an individual’s efforts to work toward their desired future career. We conceptualize and operationalize a future self as a network of future-oriented cognitive representations and complementarity as the extent of mutually beneficial connections in this network. We propose that future self complementarity amplifies the energizing effect of activated future self representations as it spreads across the network, enhancing vitality, and thus promoting proactive career behavior. In Study 1, we developed and validated a network-based measure to capture future self complementarity. In Study 2, we found, in a temporally lagged sample of 517 employees at 11 organizations, an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior through vitality. Study 3, a preregistered causal chain experiment, provided further support for this link. In Study 4, a preregistered field experiment, we again found an indirect effect of future self complementarity on proactive career behavior, assessed using a scale as well as a behavioral measure, via vitality.Funding: Financial support from a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency as part of the “Investissements d’Avenir” program [ANR-16-IDEX-008]; a grant from the Community for Learning &amp; Innovation at Erasmus University Rotterdam; and by the ESSEC Research Center is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18204 .</content>

    <title>Flexible Pay and Labor Supply: Evidence from Uber’s Instant Pay</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern tech platforms provide workers real-time control over when they work and, increasingly, flexible pay: the option to be paid immediately after work. We investigate the labor supply effects of pay flexibility and the implications of present-biased preferences among gig-economy workers. Using granular data from a nationwide randomized controlled trial at Uber, we estimate the effects of switching from a fixed weekly pay schedule to Instant Pay, a system that allows on-demand, within-day withdrawals. We find that flexible pay substantially increased drivers’ work time. Furthermore, consistent with present bias, the response is significantly higher when drivers are further away from the end of their counterfactual weekly pay cycle. We discuss welfare and broader implications in contexts in which workers have the ability to flexibly supply labor.This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05301 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For products developed through a collaboration of specialized groups, success requires craft and engineering ingenuity from designers who focus on specific attributes, coupled with synchronized coordination between various design groups. Although shared work experience in the team—or familiarity—can improve coordination, it can deter creativity. We empirically study the impact of team familiarity on market performance of products by focusing on product development in the video game industry by coupling a granular database of development credits with sales data for video games. Although familiarity among coordinators has a positive effect on performance, familiarity among designers has a negative effect. Further, the positive (negative) effect of familiarity among coordinators (designers) is present even if familiarity is built through roles other than coordination (design). Overall, team familiarity is associated with a decrease in the product's market performance. Our results suggest that infusing fluidity in design roles and maintaining stability in coordination roles could improve the performance of new products.</content>

    <title>Situated Attention and Strategic Leadership Interfaces: The Role of CEO Humility and Digital Transformation Urgency for Corporate Venture Capital Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Integrating the attention‐based view with the strategic leadership interfaces perspective, we propose a theoretical model of situational urgency mechanisms influencing the allocation of CEOs' attention towards responsive actions. Specifically, we theorize upon the role of humility, which leads CEOs towards embracing interfaces and makes them particularly attentive to the situational context in which they operate. We test our theorization by studying corporate venture capital investments in digital ventures as a response to the situational urgency for digital transformation originating from multiple levels of analysis, internal and external to the firm. Testing a sample of 362 CEOs from 191 firms and 35 industries, we find support for the importance of CEO humility and the moderating role of the lack of top management team digital experience (team‐level urgency) and emerging digital competition (industry‐level urgency). Our study provides important insights into CEO responsiveness and advances our understanding of situated attention through the theorization of situational urgency and its integration with the strategic leadership interfaces perspective.</content>

    <title>The Robin Hood Effect in Transgressions Against Firms: How Political Ideology Shapes Consumer Justifications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumer transgressions against firms involve moral violations in which consumers take advantage of loopholes in companies’ return and satisfaction-guaranteed policies or the lack of strict enforcement against password sharing, piracy, shoplifting, wardrobing, coupon stacking, promotion abuse, and fraud. Drawing on the timeless tale of Robin Hood, the legendary outlaw who stands up against injustice, the authors demonstrate that consumers use a Robin Hood justification to legitimize their transgressions against firms. Building on moral foundations theory, this research demonstrates that political ideology impacts consumers’ transgression behavior and the perceived morality of these practices. Six studies show that under certain conditions in which the moral virtues of fairness and care are cued, liberals are more likely to engage in transgressions than conservatives. The studies further test factors that can intensify or mitigate consumer transgressions against firms. Findings from this research can help marketers better understand how consumers justify transgressions and how to effectively reduce these costly and pervasive behaviors.</content>

    <title>Can Legal and Professional Personnel Selection Principles be Met With Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence)?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The purpose of this article is primarily to evaluate whether machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) can meet scientific, professional, and legal principles of personnel selection based on the rapidly accumulating research literature in Human Resource Management (HRM). It does so by addressing a series of questions in terms of what is known in the current research literature on these principles and related topics and by proposing a research agenda for what else needs to be studied. The review shows that there is enough current scientific evidence on the value of ML to support its use. ML tools are able to meet the basic principles of personnel selection and better meet many other very important principles. In addition, ML for personnel selection decisions is not a “black box” and can be understood and explained. It does not increase the legal risks from hiring, although it may require some additional steps in a few jurisdictions. There are uses of ML in selection that most organizations should be considering. Customized procedures will require good data, but generic vendor products may also serve some needs. Additional expertise may be required of HRM professionals, but not necessarily at a high level that would require new staffing or consultant expense. The availability of large language models (LLMs) may render unproctored remote assessments vulnerable to cheating, and all narrative candidate information provided in the future susceptible to AI‐generated text, resulting in more questions than research answers at this stage. The article ends with practical and theoretical implications for the use of ML in selection.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from a Twitter-like investor social platform, we document evidence consistent with self-enhancing transmission bias. We find investors are more likely to post about their better-performing stocks. Their followers are more likely to buy the posted stocks than other non-posted stocks. The effect of the postings on follow-up purchases is consistent with an attention-based interpretation: the postings bring the discussed stocks into the followers’ choice set and increase their purchases. We also find that postings’ effect on follow-up purchases is related to postings’ perceived credibility. The performance-postings relationship is stronger among more volatile stocks and the relationship between postings and follow-up purchases is stronger among stocks with higher recent returns, shedding light on the spread of high-variance and extrapolative strategies. We also document that the social network features influential nodes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Investment Incentives and Relative Bargaining Power in a Multi-Product Distribution Channel</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Distribution channels featuring a common retailer that sells competing products and makes long-term, strategic investments are widespread. Within this context, we study retailer investments that have differential impacts on demand for competing products, which implies that the retailer might intentionally weaken a strong supplier’s bargaining position with its investment by helping a weak supplier’s product become more competitive in the consumer market. Our analyses show that the relative bargaining powers of suppliers who do not directly interact determine investment efficiency, product market shares, firm and channel profit, and consumer surplus. This is in contrast with single-supplier settings, where the supplier’s absolute bargaining power determines the retailer’s investment incentives and resulting outcomes. In further contrast to single-supplier models, we find that investment can be efficient (inefficient) when the investing retailer has limited (full) bargaining power, inefficiencies can manifest as under- or overinvestment, and a supplier benefits when competing suppliers have more bargaining power vis-a-vis the retailer. Our insights extend to supplier investments, product-specific investments, and repeated sequential investments and contribute to the ongoing discourse on channel management with multilateral bargaining, backward integration, dominant retailers and suppliers, and consumer surplus.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper introduces a novel two-beta currency pricing model, which decomposes the conventional dollar factor beta into a beta with risk-premium news and a beta with real-interest-rate news. These betas capture distinct features of currency returns and explain cross-sectional variations in currency risk premiums. The risk-premium beta is associated with an unconditionally positive price of risk, while the real-rate beta has an unconditionally negative price of risk due to precautionary savings. The prices of these beta risks exhibit conditional variations tied to economic conditions. Furthermore, the model explains the abnormal performance of various currency trading strategies.</content>

    <title>Dollar Dominance and The Transmission of Monetary Policy</title>
    <updated>2025-09-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Has the dominance of the dollar in global trade rendered monetary policy ineffective? An emerging view contends that if a country invoices its exports in dollars, exchange rates cannot stabilize economic activity, as the classical expenditure-switching channel is muted. This view rests on the premise that export prices are sticky in dollars, breaking the link between export demand and depreciations. But this assumption is not borne out by the data: goods priced in dollars tend to have more flexible prices, along with higher elasticities of substitution. We propose a model with more realistic assumptions and show that even with dollar pricing, depreciating the currency by loosening monetary policy can still boost exports and activity materially. The limit to any expansion is not demand, but supply capacity. We also show that low exchange-rate pass-through to dollar prices is not informative about price stickiness. The price response to exchange rates is small when demand elasticities are high, even with flexible prices: low pass-through is an equilibrium result, not evidence of a nominal friction.</content>

    <title>When Market Incompleteness Is Preferable to Market Power: Insights from Power Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the liberalization of power markets in Europe, almost all investments have required some form of subsidy, due in part to the incomplete nature of the market. In that respect, the literature has consistently shown the benefits of risk-sharing instruments to boost investments. Because of entry barriers, however, some producers today might find themselves in a dominant position. In “When market incompleteness is preferable to market power. Insights from power markets,” Ibrahim Abada and Andreas Ehrenmann investigate the impact of completing a market with financial contracts in the presence of market power. To do so, the authors formulate a set of stochastic equilibrium investment models of risk-averse agents with possibly two types of market failure: incompleteness and market power. They provide existence results and conduct a thorough numerical application inspired by the French case. Contrary to what is reported in the literature, the authors highlight conditions under which social welfare is worse off when partially completing the market with contracts in the presence of a price-making incumbent.</content>

    <title>Online Planning in Nonstationary Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A team of researchers, Cheung and Lyu, developed a new computational approach to tackle a central challenge in online planning: balancing real-time decisions with long-term performance in dynamic systems. Traditional solutions often rely on intractable dynamic programming, but the new method delivers near-optimal performance efficiently, even in nonstationary environments. The framework addresses a broad class of planning problems with concave objectives and convex constraints, applicable to real-world scenarios like coupon assignment, order fulfillment, and resource allocation. The study considers two decision-making settings: one with unlimited access to data samples via simulations and another with finite sample data. By leveraging gradient-based insights from offline simulations, the researchers propose an offline-to-online framework that performs well in both settings. Notably, in the sampling setting, the approach improves as more data or longer planning horizons become available. Numerical tests on coupon assignment and supply chain management problems show significant gains over existing methods.</content>

    <title>Sequential Decision Making: From Decision Elicitation to Strategy Identification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Characterizing behavior in sequential problems is often complicated by the presence of multiple decision rules with overlapping predictions. To address this issue, we introduce a new experimental and econometric approach for identifying decision strategies in sequential contexts. This approach consists of eliciting conditional strategies (as opposed to direct choices) and measuring policy adherence via maximum-likelihood estimation (as opposed to counting coincidences). Applying this approach to several common types of sequential problems increases the proportion of uniquely identifiable subjects by up to a third relative to standard methods and yields the following findings. First, in search and stopping problems, decision makers respond less strongly to state and time of the dynamic problem than in problems that do not have a stopping structure. Second, decision rules are often biased toward being more accepting (less demanding) than the optimal policy would predict. Third, the format used to elicit decisions (menu-based choice versus numeric threshold entry) has a significant effect on policy adoption. In addition to identifying decision rules that better fit observed behavior in dynamic choice problems, these results have implications for firms serving customers who face sequential decisions. We use a revenue management example (optimal subscription service pricing) to show that failing to account for the relevant decision rules can reduce firm profits by up to 54%.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02381 .</content>

    <title>Efficient Switchback Experiments with Surrogate Variables: Estimation and Experimental Design</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Switchback experiments, in which experimental units are assigned to control and treatment interchangeably over time, have gained increasing popularity in recent years due to their ability to mitigate interference across units. Despite their wide adoption in the technology sector, drawing reliable inferences from such experiments remains challenging due to temporal interference. In this paper, we address this challenge by examining a special causal structure commonly found in a wide range of applications. Specifically, we consider scenarios where there exist surrogate variables at each experimental period that can fully capture the potential temporal interference from the past. We outline the necessary assumptions for identification in this context and propose an unbiased estimator using the technique of importance sampling. Additionally, we derive an experimental design with a near-optimal worst-case guarantee and compare it theoretically and empirically to the inverse propensity score estimator. To facilitate inferences, we introduce both an exact inference procedure based on Fisher’s randomization test and an asymptotic inference procedure based on the central limit theorem. We demonstrate by extensive numerical experiments that the proposed estimator, coupled with the experimental design, results in lower risk compared with the traditional inverse propensity score estimator.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Anticompetitive Effects of a Dominant Retailer’s Guaranteed Profit Margin and Low-Price Contracts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A retailer can insist on a guaranteed margin contract with its supplier, wherein it requires a margin on each sale. In addition, it may want to have the lowest selling price in a market with competing retailers, and if this strategy of offering the lowest price reduces its margin, the supplier must pay up the difference. There has been recent debate on whether this approach leads to anticompetitive behavior with elevated retail prices, monopolistic market, or diminished market coverage. We analyze a game-theoretic model involving a supplier and two retailers where the focal retailer adopts either the guaranteed margin contract or the guaranteed margin contract with lowest price guarantee. We show that when product category competition is intense, the guaranteed margin contract is anticompetitive: The supplier forms an exclusive distribution with the focal retailer leading to higher prices and reduced product access in comparison with when they both adopt a wholesale price contract. However, if the intensity of competition is low, consumers benefit by paying lower prices with wider access as long as the supplier sets identical wholesale prices, but prices remain higher when they set differentiated wholesale prices. The guaranteed margin contract with lowest price guarantee, however, always leads to higher prices by dampening competition. As such, the ability of the focal retailer to choose the contract type and the intensity of product category competition leads to outcomes that can either benefit or hurt consumers. Our results help inform policy makers on the necessary interventions to alleviate anticompetitiveness.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: A.

    <title>How Does Going Public Affect Employee Satisfaction? Evidence from Glassdoor Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how initial public offerings (IPOs) influence employees’ satisfaction with their employers. Using millions of company reviews and a generalized difference-in-differences method, we document that employees become less satisfied after their employers go public. The effect is driven by employees who joined the company before the IPO rather than those who joined after it and is stronger for employees whose tasks relate to regulatory compliance, for smaller firms, and firms with Big 4 auditors at the IPO. The effect is weaker for IPO firms in industries with low environmental, social, and governance (especially social) reputation risk. Using the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to explore changes in regulatory burdens associated with an IPO, we find that the adverse effect of an IPO on employee satisfaction is weaker for IPO firms that benefit from reduced regulatory burden. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into how going public can affect employee welfare and one potential mechanism behind this effect.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04285 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHospital-affiliated online health communities (OHCs) offer a powerful tool to enhance off-line care quality and promote health equity. This study reveals that, when physicians participate in OHCs, their patients experience a 3.87% reduction in mortality risk and a 4.63% increase in recovery rates. A key mechanism is the improvement in care continuity—better care coordination and stronger patient–provider relationships—facilitated by online interactions. Crucially, these benefits are significantly more pronounced for patients with low socioeconomic status, demonstrating OHCs’ potential to reduce healthcare disparities. To maximize impact, healthcare providers should actively encourage physician engagement in OHCs, integrate these platforms with existing health records, and promote their use among disadvantaged populations. Policymakers can leverage OHCs as a strategic tool to advance equitable, high-quality care.</content>

    <title>Vanguard: Black Veterans and Civil Rights After World War I</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly 400,000 Black men were drafted into the National Army during World War I, where they toiled primarily as menial laborers in segregated units. Leveraging novel variation from the WWI draft lottery and millions of digitized military and NAACP records, we document the pioneering role these men played in the early civil rights movement. Relative to observably similar individuals from the same draft board, Black men randomly inducted into the Army were significantly more likely to join the nascent NAACP and to become prominent community leaders in the New Negro era. We find little evidence that these effects are explained by migration or improved socioeconomic status. Rather, corroborating historical accounts about the catalyzing influence of institutional racism in the military, we show that increased civic activism was driven by soldiers who experienced the most discriminatory treatment while serving their country.</content>

    <title>Adaptive Secrecy in the Making of the Atomic Bomb: Toward a Process View of Secretive Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Secrecy is critical for knowledge protection during innovation, but it can hinder knowledge creation. Despite considerable research into when and why organizations employ secrecy, our understanding of how secrecy is managed during the research and development (R&amp;D) process remains limited. I examine how secrecy emerges, manifests, and evolves across the R&amp;D process through a historical case study of the making of the atomic bomb in the United States during World War II. I uncover a model of adaptive secrecy, whereby practices of knowledge sharing and concealment evolve with changing tensions between knowledge creation and protection. Adaptive secrecy practices give rise to different types of uncertainty (evaluative, boundary, and performance) that are navigated through three types of adaptive disclosures: revealed concealment, revealing meta-information, and revealing contextual information. Through this process, organizations develop complex, multilayered secrecy structures with in-groups, out-groups, and in-between groups. I articulate feedback relationships between elements of the adaptive secrecy model and establish boundary conditions pointing to research directions on variants of this process. This study contributes a dynamic, microfoundational view of secretive innovation, develops the notion of out-groups and in-between groups within organizations, and advances the idea of meta-knowledge sharing in collaborative work.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17687 .</content>

    <title>Margin or Mission? Understanding the Relationship Between Multilevel Functional Subgroups and Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study extends the behavioral theory of the firm by examining how functional subgroups within organizations influence strategic decision-making differentially across hierarchical levels. We argue that a larger proportion of managers in a specific functional subgroup within an executive team causes this group to focus the organization’s strategic agenda on those issues that this functional subgroup considers most important. However, within a functional subgroup, the issues to which managers pay attention can vary between hierarchical levels, with senior managers’ attention shaped by higher-level strategic schema, and lower-level managers’ attention shaped by local, more operational stimuli. We test our theory using data from 1,064 U.S. hospitals, 6,218 executives, and Medicare-adjusted pricing for hospitals’ shoppable services. Our analysis focuses on two key functional subgroups: the revenue subgroup, which focuses on financial sustainability, and the medical mission subgroup, focused on quality and accessible healthcare. We find that a higher proportion of revenue-focused managers at the system level is associated with higher insured pricing. In comparison, a higher proportion of system-level medical mission managers is associated with lower pricing. Interestingly, at the hospital level, a greater proportion of medical mission managers correlates with higher insured pricing, likely reflecting efforts to secure additional resources. Posthoc analyses further clarify the mechanisms behind these relationships. Our results highlight that functional subgroups are not monolithic; their managers’ perspectives can vary with their relative position in the organizational hierarchy, and this can provide an important mechanism of conflict resolution.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the recent Basel Accords, the Expected Shortfall (ES) replaces the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the standard risk measure for market risk in the banking sector, making it the most important risk measure in financial regulation. One of the most challenging tasks in risk modeling practice is to backtest ES forecasts provided by financial institutions. To design a model-free backtesting procedure for ES, we make use of the recently developed techniques of e-values and e-processes. Backtest e-statistics are introduced to formulate e-processes for risk measure forecasts, and unique forms of backtest e-statistics for VaR and ES are characterized using recent results on identification functions. For a given backtest e-statistic, a few criteria for optimally constructing the e-processes are studied. The proposed method can be naturally applied to many other risk measures and statistical quantities. We conduct extensive simulation studies and data analysis to illustrate the advantages of the model-free backtesting method, and compare it with the ones in the literature.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: R.

    <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Application Costs for Managing Congestion in Online Matching Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Matching platforms seek to facilitate market clearing, but congestion arises with imbalances in supply and demand. In online labor markets, when workers can apply to jobs without restriction, they may apply to an excessive volume of positions to maximize their likelihood of securing work, overwhelming employers and making screening difficult if not altogether unmanageable. Prior research has theoretically argued that imposing application costs on workers can mitigate this issue. However, the efficacy of such a solution has yet to be evaluated empirically in matching platforms where employers incur significant screening costs. We address that gap here, considering a prominent online labor market that imposed application costs on workers. We report evidence that application costs successfully improved matching outcomes via at least two channels. First, the application costs reduced bid volumes, lowering employer screening costs in turn. Second, the application costs led workers to become more selective in their applications, focusing on the employers and jobs that they were best suited for and putting greater effort into differentiating themselves, including actively reaching out to employers via direct messages. These worker-side, secondary responses enhance the first-order benefit of the application costs (i.e., constraining application volumes). Finally, the workers’ increased selectivity comes paired with risk aversion among workers, who become more likely to apply for jobs requiring familiar skills and less likely to apply for jobs posted by employers in different time zones or speaking a different language. We discuss the implications of our findings for workers’ longer-term career trajectories and market sustainability generally.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>The Interplay Between Product Variety and Customer Retention: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The optimal number of products to offer consumers is one of the core strategic problems that firms face. This is increasingly so in digital markets where many firms offer a large product variety. In these markets, consumers purchase products repeatedly, making customer retention an important aspect for firm performance. In this paper, we study the interplay between these two variables, product variety and customer retention. First, we provide a novel game-theoretic model to analyze this interplay and also determine how the optimal product variety depends on the market environment. Second, we provide suggestive evidence for our theoretical predictions using data for video games from Steam. Our data set allows us to measure the key variables in our game-theoretic model and additionally contains plausible instrumental variables for empirical identification. We show theoretically that investment in product portfolio size and investment in customer retention are substitutes because the former increases demand from switching consumers, whereas the latter increases the repurchase probability of current consumers. We then derive predictions on how market conditions determine a firm’s product variety, for which we find evidence in our empirical analyses: there is (i) a negative relation between product portfolio size and customer retention, (ii) an inverted U-shaped relationship between market value and product variety, and (iii) a positive relation between consumer heterogeneity and product variety. Both our theoretical and empirical results are robust to a wide set of robustness checks.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Grant 462020252].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00985 .</content>

    <title>All for one or one for all? How power states affect consumer giving across charities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Though ample research on consumer giving exists, it has typically focused on factors affecting donation depth, or how much a consumer donatesto one charity. Much less research has focused on factors affecting donation breadth, or how a consumer distributes donationsacross multiple charities. To address this void, the current research offers eight studies examining how donation breadth may be affected by the level of power consumers experience. A core finding is that low‐ (vs. high‐) power states lead to greater donation breadth. This effect arises through a novel mechanism by which low‐ (vs. high‐) power states promote more refined categorizations that help consumers discern cross‐charity differences to increase donation breadth. Convergent evidence of this categorization‐based mechanism is provided by causal chain, measurement‐based, and moderation approaches. The impact of this research on the prosocial behavior and consumer power literature is discussed, as are implications for organizations seeking to strategically manage consumer giving in the context of multiple charities.</content>

    <title>CEO Human Capital and Digital Product Innovation: A Dynamic Managerial Capabilities Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractHow does the human capital of chief executive officers (CEOs) drive digital product innovation in manufacturing firms? Analyzing data from 216 U.S. firms and over 8,000 new product announcements, this study shows that technological and business knowledge can both enable and inhibit digital product innovation, depending on the external environment. In stable settings, tech-savvy CEOs drive digital product innovation, whereas business-savvy CEOs focus elsewhere. In dynamic environments, these effects reverse. These findings offer a contextual view on the ongoing debate about the value of technological versus business expertise in top management, suggesting that neither type of knowledge is universally beneficial. We also find that CEOs serve as distinct innovation catalysts beyond their top management teams. Follow-up interviews reveal the diverse strategies they use to initiate, develop, and implement digital product innovation in established firms. Based on these findings, the study offers guidance for boards of directors on aligning CEO selection with environmental demands and for CEOs seeking to expand their knowledge base to more effectively foster digital product innovation under varying conditions.</content>

    <title>Quality Control for Crowd Workers and for Language Models: A Framework for Free-Text Response Evaluation with No Ground Truth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As businesses increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as customer service and information retrieval, ensuring the accuracy of their responses is a critical challenge. Traditional verification is costly, slow, and often requires scarce domain experts. We introduce the automated quality evaluation based on textual responses (AQER) framework, a novel, cost-effective method to assess the correctness of free-text answers from both LLMs and human workers without needing preexisting correct answers. AQER works by intelligently aggregating multiple responses to the same question, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to create a reliable synthetic correct answer, followed by an iterative procedure that accounts for response quality cues. AQER obtains state-of-the-art performance compared with existing automated response evaluation baselines. For managers AQER offers a scalable, data-driven method to (i) evaluate and select the best performing LLMs for specific organizational needs and use cases, (ii) continuously monitor artificial intelligence (AI) performance to ensure reliability and accountability across different model versions, and (iii) manage the quality of crowd workers essential for high-quality AI training and validation. AQER, thus, offers a robust mechanism for improving model performance and mitigating the significant financial and reputational risks associated with deploying untrustworthy generative AI technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how the emergence of digital distribution platforms (DDPs), platforms that facilitate transactions between consumers and incumbents, affects industry structure and competition. Studying the effect of delivery platforms on restaurants in the United States from 2012 to 2018, we show that DDP emergence increases exit and concentration and reduces business dynamism. We provide speculative evidence that these changes are driven by both an increase in inter‐firm competition as well as increased margin pressure from the platform. We show that strategic positioning shapes how establishments experience such changes to competition and that DDP emergence can cause a revaluation of resources within an establishment's business model. This research documents how technology‐enabled intermediaries can disrupt an industry by altering the basis of competition.Managerial AbstractThe emergence of platforms like Grubhub or Instacart that connect consumers to existing incumbent establishments can alter industry structure and within‐industry competition. We study the effect of delivery platforms on restaurants in the United States and show that the emergence of such platforms has increased exit and concentration within the restaurant industry. We present suggestive evidence that these changes are driven by intensified inter‐firm competition and increased margin pressure from the platforms. We then explore which restaurants are better able to weather the emergence of delivery platforms, showing that establishments' strategic positioning and prior investments shape the extent to which delivery platform penetration is beneficial versus detrimental. Through this research, we document how digital distribution platforms can reshape competition within an industry.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulatory concerns over a tension between expanding financial access and limiting default have led to significant restrictions on contract terms in a number of countries, despite limited evidence on their effectiveness. We use a large nation-wide RCT to examine new borrower responses to changes in interest rates and minimum payments for a credit card that accounted for 15% of all first-time formal loans in Mexico. Default rates were 19% over the 26 month experiment and a 30 pp decrease in interest rates decreased default by 2.5 pp with no effects on the newest borrowers. Doubling minimum payments increased default by 0.8 pp during the experiment but reduced it by 1 pp afterwards, possibly by reducing debt. Matching the experimental sample to their formal employment histories we find that the effect of job separation—more common among new borrowers—on default is seven times larger than the effect of the 30 pp interest rate change. We provide a simple framework for interpreting the experimental results, and rationalize the smaller contract term effects by their limited effects on cash flow rather than by differences in per-peso impacts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model a fishery with potential congestion, in which firms obtain public and private signals about the location of the densest fish stock. We analytically determine the regions of parameter space where greater precision of public and/or private information increases welfare, and we examine the effects of two types of information sharing. Using high-resolution data from the world’s largest fishery, we estimate the structural model. Point estimates imply that more precise private information raises welfare, whereas more precise public information has a negligible effect on welfare. Moreover, welfare is much more sensitive to changes in the precision of private information than to changes in the precision of public information. This difference reflects the fact that public information increases congestion more than private information does. We also find empirically that a small amount of information sharing can reduce welfare, whereas more extensive information sharing raises welfare, as do information clubs.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the adoption of electric vehicles emerges a need for coordinated charging strategies to cater to the increased and often synchronized energy demand without violating physical infrastructure limits. Common charging strategies repeatedly solve a corresponding offline problem. In “Relating Electric Vehicle Charging to Speed Scaling with Job-Specific Speed Limits,” Winschermann, Antoniadis, Gerards, Hoogsteen, and Hurink thoroughly analyze that offline problem and present the flow-based offline charging scheduler (FOCS), an algorithm that solves the problem to optimality. The authors continue to quantify the approximation ratio of repeatedly solving the offline problem throughout the day as opposed to solving the offline problem with a priori knowledge of future arrivals. Numerical experiments confirmed that the found worst-case approximation ratio of 4 is far from the achieved empirical ratio of 1.3 when evaluating the ratio for real-world electric vehicle charging instances. Experiments based on that same real-world data show that FOCS only takes seconds to schedule 400 EVs in 15-minute granularity, which is competitive with commercial solvers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fairness in Online Selection ProblemsTwo of the most studied models in online decision making are the secretary problem and the prophet inequality problem. Both capture the challenge of making irrevocable choices under uncertainty. But, what happens when candidates come from different groups and fairness enters the picture? In “Fairness and bias in online selection,” José Correa, Andrés Cristi, Paul Dütting, and Ashkan Norouzi-Fard introduce and analyze multicolor variants of these problems. In these models, each candidate belongs to a “color,” and comparisons are only meaningful within the same color. This captures real-world situations where crossgroup rankings are unreliable or biased—for instance, when evaluating students from different schools or job applicants from diverse backgrounds. For the multicolor secretary problem, the authors characterize the optimal online algorithm. In contrast to the offline optimum—which always selects from the most promising group—the optimal online algorithm is inherently fairer. For the multicolor prophet inequality, they design algorithms that enforce target selection probabilities across groups, ensuring equitable treatment.</content>

    <title>The Check Is in the Mail: Can Disclosure Reduce Late Payments to Suppliers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether buyers reduce their late payments in response to a regulatory change in the United Kingdom that mandates the public disclosure of their payment practices. We find that UK buyers subject to this regulation reduce their late payments. In cross-sectional tests, we find that this reduction in late payments is more pronounced for buyers with a greater extent of late payments, buyers facing a more concentrated supplier base, and buyer-supplier relationships in which a supplier is more important to a buyer than other suppliers. In additional tests, we document evidence consistent with increases in contracting costs for late payers after the disclosure of late payments. Specifically, we find that late-paying buyers experience (i) a loss of suppliers and (ii) a negative stock market reaction. Finally, for buyers subject to the regulation, we document a decrease in operating cash flows, increase in debt, decrease in investment, and decrease in future profitability. Our findings that the disclosure of late payments contains decision-useful information can inform standard-setters, as the FASB and IASB recently mandated new disclosures related to trade credit but omitted mandates for disclosures related to late payments.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06586 .</content>

    <title>Polluting Public Funds: The Effect of Environmental Regulations on Municipal Bonds</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present two findings on how environmental policy uncertainty impacts municipal bond returns. First, yields increase after a new pollution standard is proposed but decrease after this standard is finalized. Second, after annual announcements of compliance status, yields fall for counties that remain in compliance but increase for newly noncompliant counties. We present suggestive evidence linking these short-run municipal bond market reactions to long-run changes in pollution and housing prices. Our findings suggest that increases in either regulatory stringency or uncertainty over future environmental policy increase the cost of municipal debt raised to fund schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02340 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Relative performance evaluation has become an increasingly common component of executive compensation contracts. We study how these incentive plans relate to corporate disclosure and predict that they introduce an incremental disclosure cost. This cost arises because disclosures can help competitors make better investment decisions, enhancing their performance and thereby reducing managers’ expected compensation. Consistent with this prediction, we find a negative association between relative performance plans and voluntary value-relevant management forecasts, alongside a positive association with redactions in mandatory filings. This pattern is specific to plans with accounting-based metrics and absent for plans with price-based metrics. The results for price-based metrics are consistent with the idea that the incentive to reduce information asymmetry with market participants outweighs disclosure costs in these plans. The results for accounting-based metrics are more pronounced for managers whose plans provide stronger incentives and for those whose forecasts provide meaningful information spillovers to peers. Overall, this paper contributes the idea that relative performance plans can impose disclosure costs, thereby shedding light on contracting mechanisms that discourage disclosure—a less well-understood aspect of disclosure research.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06200 .</content>

    <title>Base Rate Neglect as a Source of Inaccurate Statistical Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical discrimination relies on people inferring unobservable characteristics of group members based on their beliefs about the group. Across four preregistered experiments (N = 9,002), we show that accurate information about the composition of top performers can induce incorrect beliefs about performance differences across groups when the groups are of unequal size. Because people fail to account for base rates, they underestimate the performance of individuals from smaller groups. As a result, when participants in our experiments receive true information about the gender composition of top performers in a male-dominated candidate pool, they are less likely to hire women, even when there are no gender differences in performance (Study 1). Similarly, they are less likely to hire better-performing non-White candidates when the racial demographics of the candidate pool reflect the U.S. population (Study 4). We show that these choices reflect an error in statistical reasoning, rather than being motivated by a desire to discriminate against any particular group (Study 2). Despite leading to less accurate beliefs, participants disproportionately seek out information about top performers when given the choice, and discrimination thus persists when information selection is endogenous (Study 3).This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00603 .</content>

    <title>On Telemedicine Reimbursements and Hospital Adoption: A Policy Analysis Using Causal Inference Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There continue to be substantial differences in the quality and access to healthcare available to communities across the United States. Researchers have called this the healthcare divide. Telemedicine, a technology‐mediated intervention that promises to bridge this healthcare divide, has been discussed by some as the great leveler. Policymakers, therefore, continue creating legislation that may drive hospitals to adopt telemedicine. Yet, how (or whether) such legislation achieves the goal of telemedicine adoption (and relatedly, healthcare divide reduction) is unclear. In the current study, we investigate a phased introduction of telemedicine reimbursement policies across various states in the United States between 2014 and 2019 to explore the causal effects of such policies on hospital adoption of telemedicine. Results suggest that while reimbursement policies drove the adoption of telemedicine services, this adoption was restricted to inpatient services rather than outpatient ones. We ground our investigation on extant theoretical insights from institutional isomorphism and highlight the limitations in our understanding of the adoption of telemedicine by hospitals in the country.</content>

    <title>The Impact of a Buyer's Incentives and Organizational Structure on Suppliers' Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Changes in a buyer organization's incentives and structure can have a significant impact on supply chain performance, such as the quality of sourced components. We examine this relationship using data from a unique quasi‐experiment where one of the two plants of a buyer introduced long‐term quality improvement incentives and a more organic structure for supply chain engineers, while the other plant did not. Analyzing longitudinal component quality data from suppliers to both plants using difference‐in‐differences and triple‐differences methods, we find that (i) the changes in incentives and structure led to differential improvements in supplier quality across the two plants, and (ii) suppliers did not easily transfer quality knowledge gained from one buyer relationship to others. Our paper contributes by showing that organizational redesign by a buyer focused on implicit incentives along with a supportive organic organizational structure can create a learning environment at its suppliers that can help improve the quality of sourced components and the learning generated does not necessarily spill over to other buyers.</content>

    <title>The Internet of Things: Reducing the Bullwhip Effect in Hospital Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how tracking the running times of durable medical equipment connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to estimate the demand for MRO products and consumable supplies (MRO &amp; CS) and lessen the Bullwhip Effect in healthcare supply chains (HSCs). By analyzing a unique data set consisting of orders for medical supplies in a multi‐echelon HSC spanning 12 quarters (3 years), using two‐stage econometric modeling and counterfactual analysis methods, we find that the sharing of these usage and consumption signals significantly improves forecast accuracy, lowers order size, and reduces the bullwhip effects of MRO &amp; CS. We find that the supply chain benefits of tracking equipment running time are amplified by the scope of the relational exchanges between supply chain partners. We analyze the two dominant IoT networking paradigms—Edge and cloud IoT—and find that the benefits of signal sharing are significantly higher under the Edge IoT network. We also find that the tracking of medical equipment has second‐order effects that extend to products whose consumption is correlated with the tracked products. Our research makes important theoretical contributions to the HSC and technology management literatures and provides valuable insights into how emergent technologies can be used to address the distinctive challenges of healthcare supply chains.</content>

    <title>Examining the Impact of Generative AI on Users’ Voluntary Knowledge Contribution: Evidence from A Natural Experiment on Stack Overflow</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice and policy abstractGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping online knowledge-sharing, but its effects on voluntary user contributions remain uncertain. This study examines how the usage of ChatGPT influences users’ answering behavior on Stack Overflow, one of the world’s largest question-and-answer platforms. Using a natural experiment, we find that access to generative AI increases the number of answers users provide, whereas those answers are typically shorter and easier to read. These patterns suggest that users are learning from AI outputs, enabling them to share knowledge more efficiently. However, intensive reliance on AI introduces cognitive strain, which can reduce contribution levels. For practice, our findings underscore the importance for platform owners and managers to strike a balance between AI integration and user support. Encouraging AI-assisted learning can expand participation and improve the accessibility of content, but safeguards are necessary to prevent cognitive overload and ensure the quality of answers. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of establishing clear guidelines for the responsible use of AI in community-driven platforms. By designing thoughtful integration strategies, organizations can harness the benefits of AI—enhancing efficiency and readability—while sustaining authentic, high-quality knowledge contributions.</content>

    <title>Willingness to Pay for Carbon Mitigation: Field Evidence from the Market for Carbon Offsets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) for carbon mitigation from demand for carbon offsets in a field experiment with an online supermarket. The experiment randomizes whether the firm subsidizes the price of the offset or matches the offset’s impact on carbon mitigation. Consumers are price-elastic but fully impact-inelastic, implying that they buy the offset but their WTP for the carbon it mitigates is zero. If the firm informs consumers that it contributes to the offset costs, WTP increases to 16 EUR/tCO2. A complementary survey shows that consumers’ stated WTP is 238 EUR/tCO2, far above their revealed preferences. (JEL D61, D82, H21, Q50, Q58)</content>

    <title>Policy Diffusion and Polarization across U.S. States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists have studied the impact of numerous state laws, from welfare rules to voting ID requirements. Yet for all this policy evaluation, what do we know about policy diffusion—how these policies are introduced and spread from state to state? We present a series of facts based on a data set of 602 U.S. state policies spanning the past seven decades. First, proxies of state capacity do not predict a higher likelihood of innovating new policies, but the political leaning of the state does predict a higher likelihood of introducing partisan laws since 1990. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity—a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so—as well as similarity in voter policy preferences. Third, since 2000, party alignment has become the strongest predictor of diffusion, and the speed of adoption has increased. Models of learning and correlated preferences can account for the earlier patterns, but the findings for the last two decades indicate a sharply increasing role of party control. We conclude that party polarization has emerged as a key factor recently for policy adoption, plausibly leading to a worse match between state policies and voter preferences.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Hybrid Fleet Management and Vehicle Repositioning in Mobility-as-a-service Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms have revolutionized urban transportation and fundamentally transformed travelers’ experience and engagement, they encounter a significant challenge in maintaining a temporal and spatial balance between supply and demand, particularly with the inclusion of crowd-sourced freelance drivers. In this study, we propose a hybrid supply-side management problem that accounts for heterogeneous revenue dependent on surge pricing, where surge pricing not only determines per-trip earnings but also influences demand elasticity and overall revenue generation. This problem combines the physical repositioning of in-house vehicles with an incentivedriven approach (surge pricing in crowd-sourcing) for freelance vehicles. A multinomial logit (MNL) model is employed to model the repositioning behavior of crowd-sourced drivers, and reformulated as a low-level equilibrium problem embedded in a bi-level program. To characterize the surge price-dependent uncertain demand, a tailored residual-based Wasserstein ambiguity set is constructed within the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. Notably, the proposed residual-based Wasserstein DRO model is demonstrated to satisfy both finite sample guarantee and asymptotic optimality. A linear decision rule (LDR) approximation facilitates a tractable reformulation, and it is shown to incur no loss of optimality for the single-period case. We validate the practical applicability of our model using a dataset from RideAustin, a ride-hailing platform operating in Austin, Texas. We find that the hybrid fleet approach gets the best of both worlds by increasing average revenue using crowd-sourced vehicles and enhancing system robustness using in-house vehicles. Interestingly, we show that a “sweet-spot” may exist as an optimal ratio between the number of in-house and crowd-sourced vehicles that maximizes the overall revenue.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Knowledge Outsourcing from a Consultant: Implications of Absorptive Capacity and Knowledge Reuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a client who has a problem she cannot solve by a given due date, and a consultant engaged to help. The consultant sets the price for knowledge outsourcing to maximize his profit. The client sets the quantity of knowledge outsourcing and the portion of the problem she solves in-house to minimize her cost. The client benefits from knowledge outsourcing only to the extent that she has absorptive capacity to understand and utilize that knowledge. In this context, absorptive capacity is driven by the client’s relevant knowledge and the working relationship between the client and the consultant. We examine how absorptive capacity impacts the key operational decisions of both the client and the consultant. Motivated by the experience of one of the co-authors, we introduce a deterministic model and two stochastic extensions that are critical in industries including semiconductor manufacturing. While we find that more absorptive capacity always reduces the client’s total cost; under certain conditions, the consultant’s profit may deteriorate. If project scope uncertainty exists, we find that, in some competitive environments, the availability of an outsourcing option can indirectly incentivize a client to take on more risk. If project completion time uncertainty exists, we show that a client employs a more experienced consultant and forgoes control of the project to lower her expected total cost. Surprisingly, in a time-based competitive environment, the more experienced consultant increases his price; whereas if time-based competition is limited, the consultant’s price is lower. Lastly, extensive numerical experiments are developed based on the synthesis of the deterministic and the two stochastic models. The numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of the analytical results. Additionally, numerical results are obtained whereby, prior to the start of the game: (i) the client may invest to increase her initial knowledge or (ii) the client and the consultant may invest to improve their working relationship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of late penalties in reducing patient tardiness. Specifically, we evaluate two types of penalties: the last-place penalty (i.e., assigning late-arriving patients to the end of the queue) and the fixed-place penalty (i.e., moving late patients back by a fixed number of positions), under two conditions—absence of a time recommendation and presence of an explicit time recommendation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 9,573 patient visits at a partner hospital in Asia. Our findings indicate that the fixed-place penalty has no significant impact on patient tardiness. In contrast, the last-place penalty significantly reduces patients’ late rate and encourages earlier arrival, particularly when no time recommendation is provided. When combined with a time recommendation, the last-place penalty continues to lower the late rate but does not further shift arrival times earlier. We also find that the lastplace penalty is effective in increasing the patient’s compliance with the time recommendation. We further implemented the last-place penalty in the partner hospital across a broader dataset involving 61,829 visits, yielding consistent results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ privacy choice between withholding and sharing personal data may change during crises. Crises not only alter personal considerations of benefits and costs of this choice, but also trigger societal considerations, such as use of shared data in crisis management. Although the literature on privacy choice has focused on personal considerations, research on how this choice is influenced by broader circumstances remains sparse. We address this topic by leveraging newly available location big data and a global public health crisis as a natural shock. Analyzing 22 billion raw records of intertemporal individual-level mobile location data across a wide spectrum of cities in the United States, we present the first large-scale evidence that opt-out reduces during a crisis, and societal, beyond personal, considerations might have influenced consumers’ privacy choices.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00017 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Auditor Reputation in an Emerging Audit Marketplace: Evidence from Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the role of auditor reputation in driving the value of smart contract audits (SCAs) within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Given the lack of regulatory oversight and the risk of cybersecurity breaches against the protocols comprising the DeFi ecosystem, a marketplace has emerged for voluntary on-demand assurance to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts’ coded logic. After documenting that market participants value SCAs and exploring the protocol attributes associated with the demand for smart contract audits, we show that auditor reputation can be established through both advertising (i.e., engagement on Twitter) and the delivery of a high-quality audit, which significantly shape the extent to which an SCA is valued. Additional analyses suggest that the value of an SCA is maximized when both high advertising and high audit quality are present, highlighting the complementary role of these two factors in enhancing auditor reputation. Furthermore, we find that events conceivably damaging the reputation of the auditor (i.e., breaches of protocols recently audited) generate a negative spillover to the auditor’s other recent clients. Overall, our study provides novel insights about the role of auditor reputation in emerging audit markets.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02245 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A holistic model encompassing a hospital patient engagement system and its relationship to the quality of provider‐patient interactions is presented. Based on service‐dominant logic, the study examined whether the effects on hospital performance of providers' systemic patient engagement efforts to enable value co‐creation are fully mediated by experiential quality (realized patient engagement). The research model was tested via 2SLS regressions using survey data matched with secondary data. Mediation hypotheses were tested using bootstrapping. The results showed that experiential quality fully mediates the beneficial effects of a hospital patient engagement system on patient recommendation, readmission rate, return on assets, and excess margin. Post hoc tests confirmed the broad applicability of a hospital patient engagement system for reputational and financial advantage.</content>

    <title>The Dual Brokerage Role of Digital Platforms in the Transition to a Circular Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transition to a circular economy hinges on effective brokerage—the work of intermediaries in connecting innovative closed‐loop recyclers (the niche) with the established waste network (the regime). While brokerage theory and its classicaltertius iungens/gaudenstypology explain how a broker's strategic intent shapes their behaviors, it offers limited insight into how brokers operate at the niche‐regime interface, a context defined by inherent tensions. This inductive study of a digital platform intermediary in the post‐industrial textile waste contexts of Bangladesh and India addresses this by theorizing brokerage as a set of tension‐derived strategies. Our empirical findings identify three tensions: network structure, operational capability, and socially sustainable capability tensions. We then show how the platform addresses these tensions through a dual role:structural brokerage, via semi‐disintermediation, andcapability brokerage, via standardization and legitimization. In addition, the platform engages in identity work to overcome its own challenge of being a new network actor. We contribute a novelcontingent perspectiveon brokerage by unpacking a broker's response to inherent tensions in a transition period. The research also shows how technology‐based intermediaries can be deployed to manage reverse flows, and it furthers understanding of how informal actors can be integrated into formal supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From salespeople and entrepreneurs to politicians and influencers, marketplace actors often communicate with their hands. But despite how integral these movements are to communication, little work in marketing has examined their effects. Might moving one’s hands while speaking increase persuasion? And if so, what types of movements are more impactful, and why? A multimethod investigation, including automated video analysis of thousands of presentations, application of a large multimodal model on almost 200,000 video segments, and preregistered controlled experiments, demonstrates that hand movement can boost impact. Further, the results demonstrate that certain hand gestures (i.e., illustrators) are particularly impactful. By making content easier to understand, using illustrators makes speakers seem more competent, which increases persuasion. Taken together, these findings shed light on hand movement’s impact, deepen understanding around nonverbal communication, and highlight how automated video analysis and multimodal models can provide insights into consumer behavior.</content>

    <title>Beyond Anthropomorphism: Social Presence in Human–&lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Collaboration Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, evolving from reactive tools to proactive collaborators, reshape team dynamics in today's digital workplaces. Text‐based collaboration now frequently involves AI participants that perform tasks traditionally handled by humans, such as creative problem‐solving and decision‐making. This transition has been linked to changes in group dynamics, particularly in relation to social presence, which appears to shape the patterns of productivity and collaboration. We conducted three empirical studies on human–AI teams to investigate the relationship between social presence and willingness to depend on teammates, team‐oriented commitment, and motivation to contribute. Drawing on social presence theory and theory of planned behaviour, our results show that while social presence has a direct association with motivation to contribute, an equally important indirect pathway is associated with human factors like team‐oriented commitment and team members' willingness to depend on each other. We show that while social presence is significantly associated with behavioural intentions, greater AI familiarity and understandability are associated with a stronger relationship, raising questions about the sufficiency of relying solely on anthropomorphic features. Our study contributes to the understanding of human–AI collaboration in social presence research, highlighting the importance of considering social and interpersonal processes in hybrid teams. Our findings have managerial implications for organizations looking to adopt AI‐based systems for collaboration.</content>

    <title>Content Moderation with Shadowbanning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms face increasing pressure to moderate harmful content while preserving user engagement and free expression. We examine shadowbanning—a strategy that hides content without notifying the user—and compare it to traditional content removal. Our results show that if users only moderately believe that shadowbanning occurs, the platform benefits from a larger user base and higher profit, which also leads to greater social welfare than with content removal or no moderation. Shadowbanning allows the platform to reduce users’ exposure to extreme content without deterring content creators, enabling more participation of users across the extremeness spectrum. However, outcomes depend on user beliefs and the accuracy of moderation technology. When users are highly suspicious of shadowbanning or when moderation tools are significantly imperfect, the platform’s incentives—and the societal benefits—decline. These findings offer practical insights for platform designers and regulators: shadowbanning can be effective, but its benefits hinge on how transparently and accurately it is implemented. Policymakers should account for user perceptions and technological capabilities when evaluating or regulating opaque moderation strategies.</content>

    <title>Evening the Odds in a Gendered Workplace: The Empowering Role of Knowledge Repositories</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations become more diverse, women are increasingly entering traditionally male-dominated technical fields like HVAC repair. However, in these gendered workplaces, women face structural biases that limit their access to the informal knowledge sharing networks crucial for task performance while also encountering significant barriers to promotion and career advancement. This study examines how access to codified organizational knowledge through online repositories can help women circumvent these workplace disadvantages, enabling them to enhance their performance and improve their prospects for professional success. Accessing general knowledge from a knowledge repository on a just-in-time basis helps improve female technician’s performance. These female technicians’ comprehensive information processing approach is the underlying mechanism of why women can better utilize general knowledge in general documents to aid independent problem solving in the field. Also, although women in this male-gendered domain face barrier to promotion, accessing more firm-specific knowledge from problem-solution documents increases their likelihood of being promoted within the firm, helping them mitigate some of the extant bias against women. General knowledge on the other hand helps women find external opportunities for career advancement.</content>

    <title>I‐Deals for Some Employees May (Not) Be Ideal for the Team: Positive and Negative Relationships Between I‐Deals Differentiation and Team Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reflecting a more balanced employer–employee relationship in which employees have latitude to shape aspects of their employment, idiosyncratic deals (i‐deals) are voluntary, personalized, nonstandard agreements that employees negotiate with their employers. In teams, i‐deals differentiation (i‐dealsD), the extent to which the degree of these arrangements varies across members, is a key form of HR differentiation. While research has largely emphasized its negative effects, we propose that the impact of i‐dealsDon team effectiveness depends on the type of i‐deals. We focus on career, flexibility, and task i‐deals, the most common types of i‐deals that employees across different jobs can negotiate with their manager. Drawing on social comparison theory, we argue that career and flexibility i‐dealsDrelate positively to team relationship conflict, and in turn associate with lower customer‐related outcomes. In contrast, task i‐dealsDrelate negatively to team relationship conflict, and subsequently associate positively with customer‐related outcomes. We test our model in two samples: a field study with three‐source data collected from 59 stores of a national restaurant chain located in the United States (Study 1) and a field study with two‐source data collected from 108 teams from three service companies located in China (Study 2). Across both studies, flexibility i‐dealsDand task i‐dealsDhad a negative and a positive association, respectively, with team customer‐related outcomes via team relationship conflict, while career i‐dealsDwas unrelated to our outcomes of interest. We advance the literatures on i‐deals and HR differentiation, and offer practical insights into the implementation of i‐dealsDin teams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores how state and religious providers of education compete during the nation building process. Using novel administrative data, we characterize the evolution of Indonesia’s Islamic education system and religious school choice after the introduction of mass public primary schooling in the 1970s. Funded through informal taxation, Islamic schools competed with the state by entering in the same markets. While primary enrollment shifted towards state schools, religious education increased overall as Islamic schools absorbed growing demand for secondary education. In the short run, electoral support for the secular regime weakened in markets with greater public school construction. Over the long run, Islamic schools established at this juncture are more differentiated in terms of religious curriculum, and cohorts exposed to mass public schooling as children are more invested in religion than in the national identity. Our findings offer a new perspective on the political economy of education reforms and the emergence of parallel systems of public goods provision.</content>

    <title>Homeownership, Polarization, and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why are job polarization and income inequality higher in large U.S. cities? I offer a new explanation: when house prices grow faster in large cities, middle-income households increasingly cannot afford to own a house there. They move to smaller cities and the middle of the income distribution in large cities hollows out, making them more polarized and unequal. I document that (1) cities with higher price growth experienced larger polarization and increase in inequality since 1980 and (2) middle-income households migrate more often to cheaper locations for housing-related reasons than low- or high-income households. Using a spatial equilibrium model with tenure choice and skill heterogeneity, I find that excess growth of prices relative to incomes and rents in large cities accounts for nearly all of the gap in polarization and almost one-half of the gap in inequality growth between large and small cities from 1980 to 2019.</content>

    <title>Pricing and Design of Pay-to-Win Add-Ons</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In player-versus-player video games, players’ natural desire to win and avoid losing has created an opportunity for game developers to sell “pay-to-win” add-ons, digital items that give buyers a competitive advantage against other players. In this paper, we investigate the pricing and design of a pay-to-win add-on, its effect on the base game, and profit implications for the developer. When a large share of the players are less price sensitive and highly willing to buy the pay-to-win add-on, we find that, surprisingly, the developer may prefer not to introduce it. Further, when it is optimal to sell the add-on, the developer designs it to be less (more) powerful in games where players are highly (moderately) sensitive to losing. In practice, the developer may design rewards or penalties in the game to influence players’ sensitivities to winning and losing, respectively. Our findings suggest that when selling a pay-to-win add-on, the developer ideally prefers players’ loss sensitivity to be neither too high nor too low, whereas high win sensitivity tends to benefit the developer. The introduction of a pay-to-win add-on influences the optimal pricing and design of the base game. In particular, the developer decreases the base game price and may even sell it as a freemium. Despite the price reduction, investment in game quality may actually increase. From the players’ perspective, our analysis shows that the introduction of a pay-to-win add-on can actually improve player surplus. In an extension of our core model, we show that the developer may prefer to customize player-to-player matching probabilities based on ownership of the pay-to-win add-on, making players who own it more likely to be matched against nonowners. However, such customization is not always optimal, and under some market conditions, the developer may optimally abstain from customizing matching probabilities. In another extension, we show that the developer may benefit from setting a negative price for the base game; counterintuitively, player surplus does not increase from negative pricing.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The web appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04610 .</content>

    <title>Human Decision Making in Dynamic Resource Allocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We experimentally study dynamic resource allocation decisions using product development as the context. A product manager must accept or reject a series of design improvement opportunities, given a limited budget. Human subjects perform well when the cost-to-implement is fixed throughout the project. However, in a more complex setting where the cost increases for the latter half of the project, subjects’ performance worsens substantially. We use the strategy frequency estimation method to analyze subjects’ decision mechanisms and find that many subjects are (a) mis-weighting future periods (underweighting in the simple case, overweighting in the complex) and (b) focusing on only the highest value opportunities. These heuristics perform poorly in the complex setting, leading to excess savings and are a counterproductive reaction to the cost increase. Top performers in the complex setting do well by decomposing the problem into two subproblems resembling the simpler setting, which they can handle nearly optimally. In a second study, we test managerial interventions based on prompting this decomposition approach to improve performance in the complex setting. Merely prompting subjects to consider problem decomposition is largely ineffective. However, additionally sharing a “best practice” budget plan that gives information about how and why top performers decompose the problem significantly improves performance. Our results highlight when decision makers will perform well or poorly in a dynamic resource allocation problem and show effective ways to reframe the problem and improve their performance.This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.Funding: The work of D.

    <title>A Global Optimization Algorithm for &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;-Center Clustering of One Billion Samples</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a practical global optimization algorithm for the K-center clustering problem, which aims to select K samples as the cluster centers to minimize the maximum within-cluster distance. Specifically, we propose a reduced-space branch and bound scheme that guarantees convergence to the global optimum in a finite number of steps by only branching on the regions of centers. To improve efficiency, we design a two-stage decomposable lower bound, the solution of which can be derived in a closed form. In addition, we also propose several structure-exploiting acceleration techniques to narrow down the region of centers, including bounds tightening, sample reduction, and parallelization. Extensive studies on synthetic and real-world data sets have demonstrated that our algorithm can solve the K-center problems to global optimal within four hours for 10 million samples in the serial mode and 1 billion samples in the parallel mode, whereas existing studies can only address small-scale problems (e.g., thousands of samples). Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art heuristic methods, the global optimum obtained by our algorithm reduces the objective function by an average of 25.8% on these synthetic and real-world data sets.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2019-05499].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00218 .</content>

    <title>Green Bonds: Reputational Bonding via Media Coverage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on prior literature showing that green bond issuance signals a firm’s environmental commitment, this paper provides empirical evidence on a mechanism that gives credibility to this signal: reputational bonding through increased media coverage. Compared with matched firms, media coverage of a firm’s environmental performance increases significantly after issuing green bonds. This increase persists over time and extends to aspects of environmental performance that go beyond the contractual obligations of the green bond. Although this result is more pronounced for positive news, the increase in negative news is significantly larger for green bond issuers with environmental controversies after green bond issuance. Cross-sectional analyses show that this media coverage increase is concentrated among green bond issuers that are larger, listed on green bond exchanges, and in countries with weaker institutional oversight of environmental issues. To shed light on the effectiveness of this reputational bonding mechanism, I find that higher media attention following green bond issuance is associated with higher environmental performance.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey 262 chief executive officer (CEO) alumni of Harvard Business School and gather evidence on three aspects of each executive’s strategy practice: how formalized it is, how it is developed, and how it is implemented. We report three main results. First, firms with higher adoption of structured strategy practices outperform their peers; they grow faster and are more profitable, especially in industries with greater strategic complexity. Second, the appointment of CEOs with more structured styles appears to drive this outperformance, not firm-specific effects. This raises the question of how an executive comes to adopt more structured strategy practices. Our third finding provides a partial answer; business education can have a lasting impact on a CEO’s strategy practices as evidenced by a regression discontinuity analysis centered around a curriculum change at Harvard Business School.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: Financial support was provided by Harvard Business School.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of venture capital (VC) firms in private mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) contracting, particularly in reducing information asymmetry. Analyzing a proprietary data set of 851 startup acquisitions from 2015 to 2020, I find that M&amp;A contracts are significantly less likely to include earnouts, mechanisms designed to mitigate information asymmetry, when a VC is involved in the transaction. Further analysis reveals that earnouts are more likely in transactions with high information asymmetry between the VC and the buyer. The study also examines the effect of prior relationships between VCs and buyers, showing that these connections not only increase the chances of repeat transactions but also further reduce the reliance on earnouts. These findings suggest that VCs play a crucial role in mitigating information asymmetry, reducing the need for earnouts, and ultimately improving M&amp;A outcomes.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: Research funding was provided by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00654 .</content>

    <title>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: Managing Uncertainties in Outcomes, Deliverables, and Means in Behavioral Intervention Development Projects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We take an extended perspective on project success that includespost‐projectoutcomes as well asat‐endandduring‐projectsuccess. To manage projects accordingly, we conceptualize three corresponding orders of uncertainty (outcomes,deliverables, andmeans uncertainties). We study 11 cases of behavioral intervention development (BID) projects to explore how managers handle each of the three orders of uncertainty to achieve post‐project success—fully, partially, or not at all. Our analysis suggests several key insights. The hierarchical nature of multi‐order uncertainty management implies that decreasing a higher‐order uncertainty (e.g., outcomes) increases the next‐lower order (e.g., deliverables). In the studied cases, reducingoutcomes uncertaintytended to increasedeliverablesandmeans uncertainties—causing one step forward to seem like two steps backward. Thus, the sequence of uncertainty‐management activities matters, with post‐project success linked to reducingoutcomes uncertaintybeforedeliverablesandmeans uncertainties. Violations of this sequencing were associated withuncertainty masking, a failure to acknowledge uncertainty that misdirected uncertainty‐management activities. Moreover, the uncertainty‐management activities must be timely, lest they become misaligned with other project activities. These findings elaborate the theorized relationships between uncertainty management and project success. We further outline how project managers can manage uncertainty byreframingoutcomes,rescopingdeliverables, andreplanningmeans.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly rely on teams to balance innovation and efficiency by simultaneously engaging in exploratory and exploitative learning. However, the cross‐level mechanisms through which firm‐level systems enable such ambidextrous capabilities at the team level remain insufficiently understood. This study develops and tests a multilevel contingency framework that explains how change‐oriented human resource management (HRM) systems foster both forms of team learning through team improvisation—a dual‐purpose capability that integrates real‐time responsiveness with adaptive refinement. Drawing on multisource, time‐lagged data from 205 new product development (NPD) teams nested within 75 pharmaceutical firms, we find that team improvisation mediates the cross‐level relationship between change‐oriented HRM systems and both exploratory and exploitative learning. Furthermore, this mediating effect is contingent upon the nature of intra‐team knowledge sharing: tacit knowledge sharing amplifies the relationship between improvisation and exploratory learning, while explicit knowledge sharing enhances its link with exploitative learning. Our findings offer theoretical insight into how HRM systems cascade across organizational levels to shape team capabilities, advancing perspectives that conceptualize ambidexterity as an emergent property of behavioral routines rather than structural design. Situated within a politically and economically constrained environment, this study also underscores the heightened strategic value of HRM systems in enabling adaptability and innovation under institutional adversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New labels with symbolic value may constitute a strategic resource for firms in established market categories, but these labels must also provide audiences with classificatory utility. We explore this tension and develop a process explanation of how firms in established market categories appropriate new labels under audience scrutiny. Analyzing eleven years (2011–2022) of earnings calls transcripts of eight leading Information Technology services firms, we theorize around their interest in appropriating the label ‘digital.’ We find that such appropriation is shaped by category work – forged in the tension between contrary impulses of the firm and the audience, and enacted through their claims, probes, and claim calibrations. We also highlight the symbolic appropriation dilemma and the unintended consequences of label appropriation for incumbents in established market categories.Managerial SummaryIncumbent firms in established market categories may strive to satisfy their stakeholders' demands for demonstration of both continuity and novelty by developing symbolic management strategies. In doing so, these incumbents may come to view novel category labels as valuable resources for symbolic action. However, the incumbent's pursuit of symbolic action in an established market category is often constrained by the conservative scrutiny of securities analysts. Our study of the global Information Technology services industry reveals the mechanisms of claim calibration deployed by executives to evade or blunt analyst scrutiny while appropriating the digital label. Our study also alerts leading incumbent firms to a dilemma of symbolic management that compels them to confront the trade‐off between symbolic appropriability and symbolic flexibility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trade wars and financial sanctions are again becoming an increasingly common part of the international economic landscape, and the dynamics of the exchange rate are often used in real time to evaluate the effectiveness of sanctions and policy responses. We show that sanctions limiting a country's exports or freezing its assets depreciate the exchange rate, while sanctions limiting imports appreciate it, even when both types of policies have exactly the same effect on real allocations, including household welfare and government fiscal revenues. Beyond the direct effect from sanctions, increased precautionary savings in foreign currency also depreciate the exchange rate when they are not offset by the sale of official reserves or financial repression of foreign-currency savings. We show that the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 are quantitatively consistent with the combined effects of these forces calibrated to the observed sanctions and government policies. We evaluate the associated welfare, fiscal and inflationary consequences for both Russia and the coalition of Western countries.</content>

    <title>Ripples in the Pond: Product Portfolio Reconfiguration and Dynamism in the Competitive Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The management literature often overlooks how firms can alter the competitive landscape without introducing groundbreaking changes or innovations. Applying the awareness, motivation, and capability framework from competitive dynamics, we posit that as a firm intensifies its product portfolio reconfiguration, its rivals become increasingly aware and motivated to respond, creating a ripple effect that accelerates change in the competitive environment. However, extreme reconfigurations may decrease rivals’ motivation due to the costly and disruptive nature of keeping pace. We also argue that rivals will be more motivated to respond to reconfigurations from a firm with high customer orientation and when they possess financial slack. Using a longitudinal dataset of 6382 firms’ product portfolios and those of their rivals, we find support for these arguments. This study contributes to competitive dynamics research by expanding the focus to a firm’s entire set of rivals and highlighting how a firm’s competitive moves can result in ripple effects throughout its rival network. We also demonstrate how moderate organizational changes can quickly lead to increased environmental dynamism, an overlooked avenue in research of dynamism. Finally, we suggest that a broadened competitive dynamics perspective rooted in Austrian economics can enhance our understanding of firm adaptation.</content>

    <title>Work Has Changed, Has &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt;? Designing for the Distributed, Fragmented, and Fluid Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses the growing misalignment between traditional human resource management (HRM) systems and the realities of distributed, fluid, and fragmented work. To address this issue, we introduce the FLUID‐HRM framework—a layered design architecture that reconfigures core HRM domains (resourcing, rewards, development, relations, work systems) across onsite, hybrid, and distributed forms of work. The framework is anchored in five structural principles of fluidity: spatial flexibility, temporal desynchronization, employment multiplicity, identity fragmentation, and digital mediation. For each, we propose differentiated HRM responses and corresponding information system (IS) infrastructures. Rather than retrofitting core legacy models, FLUID‐HRM offers a principle‐based approach for designing ethical, effective, and inclusive people systems in boundaryless work environments. By linking structural challenges to HRM innovation, we extend foundational HRM theory and provide actionable guidance for organizations navigating the transformation of work.</content>

    <title>How Activists Collaboratively Divide the Labor of Making Change: The Case of LGBT Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While theories at the crossroads of social movements and organizations have explored different strategies and challenges faced by insider and outsider activists, research examining their collaborations is just emerging. We contribute to this literature by introducing the concept of collaborative division of labor, which theorizes how social movement organizations (SMOs) collaborate through adoption of different roles, leveraging their distinct positions (insiders, outsiders, belonging to different sectors), postures (persuasive or disruptive), and expertise to pursue a common political agenda. Through a study of the LGBT movement in French workplaces, we examine the interactions among eight SMOs with regard to four strategies: amplifying one another’s actions, compelling organizations to respond, threatening organizations’ reputations, and engaging in complementary datactivism (the production and dissemination of data for a social movement cause). Our findings show that SMOs’ division of labor relied on multidirectional collaborations, as activists adopted roles that provided complementary, unidirectional, mutually beneficial, and indirect support to one another. In addition, our research offers counterintuitive insights about the postures of insider and outsider activists, as we argue that these postures do not always align with what is expected in the literature. Last, we reveal how this collaborative division of labor led to several intermediate outcomes, thereby enhancing our understanding of the effects of interactions that go beyond competitive dynamics among groups within the same movement.</content>

    <title>Why and How Family Business Research Should Account for Differences Between Public and Private Family Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This methodological brief explains why and how family business research should account for public/private ownership to better understand how family control and influence affect firm outcomes. To support our arguments, we review the methodologies used in family business studies and identify four methodological pitfalls that obscure heterogeneity in family firm private/public ownership. We propose practical solutions to address those pitfalls and apply them to a recent study, showing how accounting for private/public ownership alters its empirical findings. The implication of our brief is that more fine-grained methodological attention to public/private family firm ownership will enhance family business research.</content>

    <title>Right on cue? Category‐switching in online marketplaces</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and why do producers change the categorization of their offerings? Prior categorization research assumes that producers engage in ongoing efforts to proactively optimize their categorical positioning, but this assumption may not hold for many producers due to their limited attentional capacity. Our theoretical account instead highlights the role of expectation violation cues—salient pieces of information indicating a violation of audience expectations—as triggers that can lead producers to revise their category choice. Our longitudinal study of 84,667 Airbnb hosts' categorization choices finds that negative customer reviews—an important form of expectation violation cue—significantly increase the likelihood of category‐switching, particularly in categories with heterogeneous expectations. Our study suggests that many producers might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.Managerial SummaryHow businesses categorize their products and services influences their commercial success; yet, there exists very limited understanding of when, why, and how businesses revise their category choices. Our study, which tracked the category choices of over 80,000 Airbnb hosts over time, reveals that Airbnb hosts most commonly switch categories after receiving negative customer reviews, particularly when a review indicates that the accommodation did not meet customer expectations and if the previously chosen category lacks a clearly defined set of expected features. When switching categories, hosts tend to choose categories that are relatively similar to their prior choices and that seem to accommodate a wide variety of offerings. These patterns suggest that many businesses might be less proactive about their category choices than previous research assumed.</content>

    <title>Competing through category interaction codes: An inhabited view of category strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces category interaction codes—knowledge regarding the expected interactions around entities in a given category—as a critical dimension of category strategy. Through historical analysis of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we demonstrate how these codes shape strategic categorization and competitive dynamics. We show that firms can exploit ambiguous interaction codes to access advantageous decision makers and organizational routines, circumventing entrenched competitors. Further, firms can institutionalize preferred interaction codes through product design, reshaping category prototypes and market dynamics. However, overcommitment to specific interaction codes creates competitive vulnerabilities when market conditions shift. By developing an “inhabited” view of categories that emphasizes socially embedded practices, this study reveals how market categories are enacted through interactions and offers new insights into category‐based competition.Managerial SummaryThis study introducescategory interaction codes—expectations about where, when, how and by whom products are evaluated, used, and purchased within a market. Using the case of Wang Laboratories in the early computer industry, we show that companies can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging and reconfiguringcategory interaction codes. For example, Wang Laboratories sidestepped direct competition with IBM by categorizing its products for engineers and department managers rather than MIS executives, and outperformed IBM in word processing by innovating how actors interact with the new category. For managers, the key insight is that success depends not only on product features but also on how your product fits into the daily decisions, roles, and behaviors that define a category.</content>

    <title>The role of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; integrity in M&amp;amp;A decision‐making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the influence of CEO characteristics on M&amp;A decisions has long spurred researchers’ interest, little attention has been devoted to the ramifications of CEO integrity—the adherence to generally accepted norms and standards. We investigate how CEO integrity influences different stages of the M&amp;A decision process. Specifically, we argue that while CEO integrity reduces self‐serving behavior, it may also become a golden cage that constrains CEOs’ latitude of action. Accordingly, we find that CEO integrity decreases the probability of Type I errors (errors of commission) but increases the probability of Type II errors (errors of omission) in M&amp;A decision‐making. We contribute to theory development by putting forward CEO integrity as an important personality construct for upper echelons research to build on and extend further.Managerial SummaryThis paper examines how CEO integrity influences M&amp;A decision‐making, providing key insights for corporate strategy. Analyzing data from S&amp;P 1500 firms (2006‐2021), we find that CEOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in frequent or large‐scale M&amp;As, particularly avoiding cross‐border deals due to higher uncertainty and potential risks. High‐integrity CEOs also tend to pay lower acquisition premiums and take longer to complete deals, reflecting a cautious and thorough approach. While CEO integrity helps protect firms from costly mistakes it may also lead to missed growth opportunities, indicating a trade‐off between stakeholder considerations and strategic risk‐taking. Boards may need to tailor governance frameworks to optimize the balance between the benefits and constraints of CEO integrity.</content>

    <title>Human–Algorithmic Bias: Source, Evolution, and Impact</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior work on human-algorithmic bias has seen difficulty in empirically identifying the underlying mechanisms of bias because in a typical “one-time” decision-making scenario, different mechanisms generate the same patterns of observable decisions. In this study, leveraging a unique repeat decision-making setting in a high-stakes microlending context, we aim to uncover the underlying source, evolution dynamics, and associated impacts of bias. We first develop a structural econometric model of the decision dynamics to understand the source and evolution of bias in human evaluators in microloan granting. We find that both preference-based and belief-based biases exist in human decisions and are in favor of female applicants. Our counterfactual simulations show that the elimination of either of the two biases improves the fairness in financial resource allocation as well as the platform profits. The profit improvement mainly stems from the increased approval probability for male borrowers, especially those who would eventually pay back loans. Furthermore, to examine how human biases evolve when being inherited by machine learning (ML) algorithms, we train state-of-the-art ML algorithms for default risk prediction on both real-world data sets with human biases encoded within and counterfactual data sets with human biases partially or fully removed. We find that even fairness-unaware ML algorithms can reduce bias in human decisions. Interestingly, although removing both types of human bias from the training data can further improve ML fairness, the fairness-enhancing effects vary significantly between new and repeat applicants. Based on our findings, we discuss how to reduce decision bias most effectively in a human-ML pipeline.This paper has been accepted by D. J. Wu for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03862 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that stock lenders are informed about market conditions and pursue revenue maximization by setting premiums or offering discounts on stock loan fees. Using a model of supply and demand in the equity lending market, we illustrate the effect of stock borrowers’ private information on the elasticity of shorting demand. Strategic lenders respond to demand elasticity and increase their revenues through premiums or discounts on lending fees. Empirically, decomposing stock loan fees into intrinsic fee and premium or discount, we confirm lenders’ strategic behavior, showing that premiums and discounts among difficult-to-borrow stocks lead to increased lending revenues. This strategic lending behavior has new implications about informed shorting, short interest, and transaction costs in the equity lending market.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03270 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mutual funds known as closet indexers are marketed as active but actually operate as low-activity funds. Investors end up paying for full service but receiving only a part of it. Supervisory authorities around the world are considering ways to regulate these funds. In this context, we examine the impact of regulatory interventions by Scandinavian regulators. We compare the scrutinized Scandinavian funds with similar unaffected European funds. The findings suggest that the regulated Scandinavian funds preferred increased activity over fee reduction. Consequently, fund managers adopted more active management strategies, resulting in a significant 2% decrease in annual alpha. Therefore, the regulatory interventions resulted in unfavorable outcomes for investors.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Funding: This research was supported by funding from the Varekrigsfond for forsikringsaktiviteter at NHH.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03124 .</content>

    <title>Inheriting Versus Developing Data Analytic Tests and Auditors’ Professional Skepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the use of audit data analytic tests (ADA) becomes increasingly established in practice, auditors will often confront situations in which they inherit ADA developed by others, as opposed to developing the ADA themselves. Despite the potential benefits of ADA, inheriting ADA could decrease auditors’ skeptical actions by diminishing their psychological ownership of the ADA. In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA. Evidence from mediation analyses suggests that these effects are driven by decreased psychological ownership when auditors inherit the ADA.</content>

    <title>Listen Closely: Measuring Vocal Tone in Corporate Disclosures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the usefulness of machine learning approaches for measuring vocal tone in corporate disclosures. We document a substantial mismatch between the widely adopted actor‐based training data underlying these approaches and speech in corporate disclosures. We find that existing models achieve near‐perfect vocal tone classification within their training domain. However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance. Our findings emphasize the importance of a domain‐specific approach to voice analysis in accounting and finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous Entrepreneurship has been conceptualized as arising from and reflecting cultural characteristics common to Indigenous people internationally, yet this approach increasingly fails to capture its diversity. Drawing on a database of 19,530 Indigenous enterprises in Australia, we show that criterial approaches to defining Indigenous Entrepreneurship based on preconceived ideas about Indigenous ways of doing business do not adequately characterize Indigenous entrepreneurial activity. We propose an approach that analyses Indigenous entrepreneurialism as a strategic response to the challenges and opportunities encountered by Indigenous entrepreneurs, shifting the focus of study fromexpressions of indigeneity in entrepreneurship, toentrepreneurial responses to Indigenous contexts.</content>
