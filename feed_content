    <title>Nonbank Lending and the Transmission of Monetary Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the role of nonbank lenders in the transmission of monetary policy using data on the universe of unsecured credit to firms and households in Denmark. Nonbanks increase their credit supply after a monetary contraction, both relative to banks and in absolute terms. The increase in nonbank lending is financed through increased long-term debt. A model with segmented debt markets featuring differential investor rate sensitivities rationalizes these findings. Nonbank credit insulates corporate investment and household consumption from monetary contractions, with positive spillovers extending beyond nonbank clients through industry and geographic channels.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of insurance companies in supporting resiliency in the corporate bond market. We show that during the COVID-19 liquidity crisis, insurers increased their corporate bond positions, particularly in bonds facing fire sales by mutual funds. Insurers with more stable funding were more likely to buy, and they bought more from dealers with whom they had prior trading relationships. Dealers improved their bond liquidity provision when they had trading relationships with insurers with more stable funding. Our work demonstrates that insurers can play an important role in supporting bond market resiliency during times of stress. (JEL: G10, G12, G20, G22, G23, G24)</content>

    <title>Taxes Depress Corporate Borrowing: Evidence from Private Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use variation in state corporate income tax rates to re-examine the relation between taxes and corporate leverage. Contrary to prior research, corporate leverage rises after tax cuts for small private firms. An estimated dynamic equilibrium model shows that tax cuts make capital more productive and spur the use of leverage. Tax cuts also produce more distant default thresholds and lower credit spreads. These effects outweigh the lower interest tax deduction and lead to higher optimal leverage choices, especially for firms with flexible investment policies. The presence of the interest tax deduction raises consumer welfare in equilibrium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Novel Fully Online Matching Algorithm in Stochastic EnvironmentsIn many modern applications, such as ride-sharing, participants arrive and depart dynamically, requiring quick decisions about who to match and when. In “Fully Online Matching with General Stochastic Arrivals and Departures,” Li, Wang, and Yan introduce a fully online matching framework that models these real-world dynamics. Each arrival follows a known identical and independent distribution over agent types, whereas the sojourn time is unknown in advance and follows type-specific distributions with known expectations. To address this, they propose a linear programming–based algorithm that guarantees a competitive ratio of at least 0.192 under mild conditions—more than 50% better than the state-of-the-art result of 0.125. They also establish several hardness results to highlight the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. Numerical experiments further confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of their algorithm, offering new insights for decision making in stochastic and dynamic environments.</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Resource Pooling</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Resource pooling improves system efficiency drastically in large stochastic systems, but its effective implementation in decentralized systems remains relatively underexplored. This paper studies how to incentivize resource pooling when agents are self-interested, and their states are private information. Our primary motivation is applications in the design of decentralized computing markets, among others. We study a standard multiserver queueing model in which each server is associated with an [Formula: see text] queue and aims to minimize its time-average job holding and processing costs. We design a simple token-based mechanism where servers can earn tokens by offering help and spend tokens to request help from other servers, all in their self-interest. The mechanism induces a complex game among servers. We employ the fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) concept to analyze the system, combining mean-field approximation with fluid relaxation. This framework enables us to derive a closed-form characterization of servers’ FMFE strategies. We show that these FMFE strategies approximate well the servers’ rational behavior. We leverage this framework to optimize the design of the mechanism and present our main results: As the number of servers increases, the proposed mechanism incentivizes complete resource pooling—that is, the system dynamics and performance under our mechanism match those under centralized control. Finally, we show that our mechanism achieves the first-best performance even when helping others incurs higher job processing costs and remains nearly optimal in settings with heterogeneous servers.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model social media as collections of users producing and consuming content. Users value consuming content, but due to scarce attention, they may not value all content from other users. Users also value receiving attention, creating the incentive to attract an audience by producing valuable content but also through attention bartering—users mutually becoming each other’s audience. Attention bartering shapes substantially the patterns of production and consumption on social media, explains key features of social media behavior and platform decision making, and yields sharp predictions that are consistent with data we collect from #EconTwitter. We conduct Twitter and Instagram user surveys that yield additional direct evidence in support of attention bartering, and we discuss the implications of attention bartering for the design of social media platforms.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00060 .</content>

    <title>The Treasury Collateral Spread and Levered Safe-Asset Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Banks are vital suppliers of money-like safe assets, which they produce by issuing short-term liabilities and pledging collateral. But their ability to create safe assets varies over time as leverage constraints fluctuate. I write a simple model to describe private safe-asset production when intermediaries face leverage constraints. I directly measure leverage constraints using confidential supervisory data on high-frequency changes in the largest banks’ repurchase agreements (repos). The collateral spread—the maturity-matched yield spread between Treasuries used as repo collateral more often and Treasuries used less often—compensates for bank leverage risk and averages about 0.5 basis points, a sizable magnitude roughly equal to 60% of the five-year Treasury cheapest-to-deliver basis.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06104 .</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Precision and Human Decision: A Study of Interactive Optimization for School Schedules</title>
    <updated>2025-11-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In collaboration with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), this paper introduces an interactive optimization framework to tackle complex school scheduling challenges. The choice of school start and end times is an optimization challenge, as schedules influence the district’s transportation system, and limiting the associated costs is a computationally difficult combinatorial problem. However, it is also a policy challenge, as transportation costs are far from the only consequence of school schedule changes. Policymakers need time and knowledge to balance these considerations and reach a consensus carefully; past implementations have failed because of policy issues, despite state-of-the-art optimization approaches. We first motivate our approach with a microfoundation model of the interplay between policymakers and researchers, arguing that limiting their dependency is key. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that includes (1) a fast algorithm capable of solving the school schedule problem that compares favorably to the literature and (2) an interactive optimization approach that leverages this speed to allow policymakers to explore a variety of solutions in a transparent and efficient way, facilitating the policy decision-making process. The framework led to the first optimization-driven school start time changes in the United States, updating the schedule of all 133 schools in SFUSD in 2021, with annual transportation savings exceeding $5 million. A comprehensive survey of approximately 27,000 parents and staff in 2022 provides evidence of the approach’s effectiveness.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05834 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study ethnic investing, using transaction data from Kenya’s stock exchange and CEO/board turnover. We show that a given investor invests more in a given firm when the firm is run by coethnics and earns lower risk-adjusted returns on such investments. We then model and empirically test for the aggregate impact of (i) the implied taste- or psychology-driven investor discrimination and (ii) counteracting demand- and supply-side forces. Our estimates imply that listed Kenyan firms could collectively be worth 38% more—with minority-run firms benefitting the most—if the neutral proportion of active investors increased from 4.6% to 50%.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03660 .</content>

    <title>Heterogeneous Oil Supply Elasticities: Indebtedness and Production Responses to the COVID-19 Shock</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Debt matters for oil supply elasticities. We document the resiliency of oil production to the COVID-19-related collapse in demand due to indebtedness. We use exogenous variation in the timing of debt-related payments to identify financially constrained operators. We show that more financially constrained firms cut production by less than less-constrained firms and were less likely to complete new wells. To explore the mechanisms, we use borrowing-limit cuts and credit-line drawdowns to measure access to credit, and we exploit failed hedging practices. The propagation of oil demand shocks crucially depends on the indebtedness of the oil sector. (JEL G32, D22, Q41)</content>

    <title>Diversification, Market Entry, and the Global Internet Backbone</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many industries, buyers diversify their supplier base to manage supplier disruption risk. We investigate the importance of such diversification as a determinant of demand and supplier entry in the context of the internet backbone, the worldwide network of undersea fibre-optic cables that underpins the internet. We specify a model of international bandwidth demand and cable operators’ dynamic entry and supply choices. The model is estimated using novel data on cross-border data flows, prices, cable characteristics, and disruptions. Counterfactual analysis reveals that supplier diversification accounts for a large share of entry and surplus created between 2005 and 2021. Relative to the socially optimal level of entry, distortions due to suppliers’ inability to capture fully the social benefits of diversity are as large as distortions due to business stealing.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Capacity Configuration and Allocation under Capacity Risk: Trade-Offs between Fill Rates and Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Capacity configuration and allocation problems in production networks under demand uncertainty have been extensively studied in the literature. In addition to demand uncertainty, capacity risk is also prevalent in practice. This paper considers a bipartite production system consisting of multiple plants and a set of customers located in different areas. In particular, these plants will use their configured capacities, facing capacity risk, to serve those customers who have differentiated fill-rate requirements with uncertain demands. Our objective is to optimize capacity configuration and allocation decisions by formulating the problem as a two-stage stochastic program that explicitly incorporates capacity risks and budget constraints. First, we develop a novel “randomized edge-weighted max-flow” priority rule that integrates capacity risk, penalty costs of unmet demands, and allocation costs to allocate the realized capacities to satisfy fill-rate targets, with a tunable parameter introduced to balance service levels and costs. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying plants with zero capacities and obtain some practical insights, which can help reduce the potential redundancy of the network system. When partial information and correlation of distributions are known, we implement robust optimization techniques to obtain the ranges of robust capacities under various scenarios. Some practical managerial implications are derived by theoretically discussing the impacts of capacity risk and demand correlations on these ranges. From numerical experiments, we found that the long-chain configuration no longer has the “almost-as-goodas-the-fully-flexible-network” advantage when the capacities are random. In addition, we also investigate the impacts of correlations among realized capacities or demands on the associated flexibility. Finally, some interesting and useful insights for practitioners can be obtained by analyzing the impacts of costs, fill rates, and uncertainty on the total optimal capacity and total configuration cost.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing under Consumer Habituation: The Optimality of a Familiarity-Based Threshold Policy</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical evidence indicates that consumers experience a relative loss of excitement over time and miss their habits when refraining from consumption under repeated purchases. Despite the practices of first-time trials and welcome-back offers, how to exploit this habituation behavior through customized dynamic pricing is overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we analyze the long-run optimal customized dynamic pricing strategy in the presence of consumer habituation for time/frequency-based consumption. The consumer’s willingness to pay is determined by past consumption via the habitual level of consumption. We formulate the seller’s continuous-time profit maximization problem over an infinite horizon as an optimal control problem and derive the closed-form value function and optimal pricing strategy. We identify a key condition on the willingness-to-pay function that captures both the magnitude of the habituation effect and the saturated willingness to pay, which plays a central role in determining the seller’s optimal pricing policy. When consumers retain interest even at high levels of habitual consumption, alwayssellingby pricing at their current willingness to pay is optimal. In contrast, if consumers lose interest when saturated, the optimal policy becomes a cutoff strategy, where the seller offers the product only when consumption remains below a critical threshold and prices out consumers beyond it.We further examine the resulting pricing and consumption dynamics and characterize an equilibrium habitual level of consumption at which randomized promotions can be optimal. Furthermore, our key findings qualitatively hold under random consumer valuation, but with richer patterns. Our work provides a tractable, closed-form characterization of the optimal dynamic pricing policy under consumer habituation, offering a more nuanced understanding of the strategic implications of an inverted U-shaped willingness-to-pay.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To increase their competitiveness, firms continue to upgrade their products and to buy technology upgrade components. While firms generally know the value of technology upgrade products (components), they do not know when the upgrade solution can be produced on a massive scale, who can produce it, and what the unit production cost is when they make their purchase decisions. To obtain the upgrade solution information and to reduce their purchase costs, some firms adopt thestrategic supplier with bargainingmechanism, while other firms adopt thereverse auction with incentivemechanism. Recently, some firms (e.g., China National Petroleum Corporation) have adopted an innovative mechanism: they establish strategic partnerships with advanced suppliers and promise a proportion of the order to incentivise them to reveal the information on time. Meanwhile, they also adopt the reverse auction to determine the winning supplier and the purchase price for the remaining order to reduce purchase costs. Motivated by these firms’ practices, we propose a new procurement mechanism for technology upgrade products:the strategic auction mechanism. We analyse the optimal promised proportion of the order, the suppliers’ equilibrium policy, and the buyer’s equilibrium profit under this mechanism. In addition, we compare the performance of these three mechanisms and identify their application conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Algorithms for Online Metric Matching with Stochastic Arrivals or PredictionsHow do we match riders to drivers? Online metric matching offers a clean abstraction of this problem, where arriving riders are instantaneously matched to waiting drivers and the matching cost is measured by the pickup distance. Its challenge lies in making matching decisions without knowing the locations of future riders, for which the simple greedy approach yields suboptimal solutions. In their paper “Online Metric Matching: Beyond the Worst Case,” Yang and Yu propose a novel algorithmic framework of designing algorithms for online metric matching when given access to additional information of riders’ locations in advance. They then apply this framework to derive new algorithms when the riders’ locations are independently sampled or when an untrusted prediction of riders’ locations is provided. In the former model, their algorithms achieve improved competitive ratio and regret guarantees for various settings. In the latter model, they present an algorithm whose performance smoothly depends on the prediction error while preserving the worst-case guarantee.</content>

    <title>Collaborative Learning and Decision Making on Pricing and Recommendation: A Simple Framework for Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We formulate a collaborative learning and decision-making problem involving contextual information. In current business practices, pricing and recommendation decisions often are made jointly by multiple teams in sequence. The decision-making processes for different teams can be controlled by either a centralized or decentralized planner. We propose a simple collaboration framework that integrates the learning about decision making in an unknown environment. The main challenge in a decentralized framework is that the decision-making process in other teams is unknown, but the subsequent decisions are mutually dependent. From a practical concern about high exploration costs and implementation complexity, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for centralized planners and a “greedy” + “weighted sampling” (GWS) algorithm for both centralized and decentralized planners to balance the learning and earning. We show that the exploration-free greedy algorithm can achieve the optimal rate when context diversity holds. The GWS algorithm works effectively for either centralized or decentralized planners under a much weaker condition, which we call context variation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the multiproduct pricing and ranking problem and study the model misspecification issue. We validate our results using simulations on synthetic and real data.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine environmental, social, and governance (ESG) misreporting in the context of the UK government requirement to report gender employment ratios and pay gaps. Highlighting misreporting, many employers report a set of disclosures that are together mathematically impossible. Further, a disproportionate number of employers report perfectly balanced gender statistics, consistent with misreporting as a form of ESG-washing. Suggesting that a lack of ethical considerations encourages misreporting, employers involved in ESG controversies and who commit labor violations are more likely to misreport. Suggesting that capital market and media scrutiny discourage misreporting, employers that are the subject of an article about their gender pay gap reports and employers that receive an ESG audit or financial audit from a Big 4 auditor are less likely to misreport. Overall, our results suggest that 12%–15% of employers misreport in 2017 and 8%–11% misreport in subsequent years. Our findings highlight the importance of meaningful oversight within the context of ESG reporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05125 .</content>

    <title>Capitalism Versus Socialism: Can (or Should) Management Scholars Embrace Varieties of Socio‐Economic Systems in a Multipolar World?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In an increasingly multipolar world, thisPoint–Counterpointdebate discusses the imperative for Management and Organization Studies (MOS) to embrace different contexts of socio‐economic systems, specifically varieties of socialism, and in doing so move beyond the predominant capitalist model as a central assumption in the literature. In theirPoint, Bruton, Li and Gautam argue that MOS has insufficiently embraced socialism as an empirical reality, despite nearly half of the world’s population living in nations reflecting some variety of socialism, in addition to modes of organization following an ethos closer to socialism than capitalism. This view is challenged by theCounterpointof Foss, Klein, Holmes and Terjesen. While they agree that considering institutional context is vital, they reject thePoint’sposition, question its imputing of a widespread ‘capitalist bias’, and are concerned that its ethos‐based definitions are imprecise and politically charged. Based on their productive disagreement, collectively thisPoint–Counterpointdebate underscores the imperative for greater contextualization in MOS more generally, and in entrepreneurship research more specifically, and that organizational goals beyond pure financial profit maximization warrant deeper scholarly attention. This introduction concludes by sketching future research avenues, including configurational institutional analysis, exploring collective motivation in entrepreneurship, and analysing the mechanisms of state control.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Micromanagement (MM) is a popular topic in management circles, where its negative reputation is palpable, and yet academics have not shared this interest. As a result, our understanding of MM is deficient, marred by disjointed definitions and paradoxical views. Our research aims to clarify the construct and measurement of MM through a series of five studies that (1) define the MM construct, (2) develop a psychometrically reliable and valid measure, and (3) validate a preliminary nomological network. Based on combined deductive and inductive approaches, we establish a comprehensive construct definition of MM. Subsequently, we develop and validate a nine-item Micromanagement Scale (MMS-9). Drawing on data from eight distinct samples encompassing 1,723 individuals employed across diverse industries, we found that (a) MM is a hierarchical construct comprising three related core attributes (i.e., controlling, close monitoring, detail focus) and three key features (i.e., excessive, sustained, unnecessary), (b) the MMS-9 exhibits nomological validity, as evidenced by its significant relationships with theorized antecedents (e.g., low trust and leader-member exchange) and consequences (e.g., high turnover intentions and emotional exhaustion), and (c) the MMS-9 demonstrates discriminant and incremental validity against relevant orbiting leadership constructs (i.e., authoritarian leadership, participative leadership, empowering leadership, initiating structure, directive leadership, and abusive supervision). We discuss the implications of the MMS-9’s availability for advancing the study of micromanagement, with particular focus on potential avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>It’s Different: Examining the Effect of HRM Investments on Employee Downsizing Following Mergers and Acquisitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although some scholars in strategic human resource management (SHRM) research have suggested that HRM investments can be effective in reducing the negative repercussions of employee downsizing, other scholars have argued that such HRM investments could convey contradictory messages to employees, resulting in more negative employee reactions and decreased firm performance. In this research, we addressed this unsettled question by looking into the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) context, where we theorized that the acquiring firm’s HRM investments can positively moderate the negative effect of employee downsizing on firm performance by invoking positive sensemaking processes from remaining acquired firm employees. Moreover, the positive sensemaking effects of HRM investments extend beyond remaining acquired firm employees to influence the overall performance of the merged firm. We examined established HRM investments by acquiring firms prior to the M&amp;A and additional HRM investments made after the M&amp;A. Using a representative sample of 5,467 firm-year observations from 1,214 U.S. publicly traded firms between 2002 and 2018, we found that both pre- and post-acquisition HRM investments by acquiring firms mitigate the negative effect of employee downsizing following M&amp;A on firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for both research and practice.</content>

    <title>More Than Words: A Risk Regulation Model of Supervisor Gratitude Expression, Felt Appreciation, and Subordinate Voice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Feeling appreciated is integral to developing and sustaining high-quality relationships, yet many employees do not feel appreciated at work. Drawing on risk regulation theory for interdependent relationships, we developed a risk regulation model of supervisor gratitude expression, felt appreciation, and subordinate voice. We propose that when a supervisor’s agentic or communal gratitude expression aligns with a subordinate’s preference, the subordinate will experience greater felt appreciation and thus engage more in voice—a relationally risky behavior. First, we followed a five-step scale-development process using four distinct samples to create and validate measures of supervisors’ agentic and communal gratitude expression and subordinates’ corresponding preferences. We then tested our model in a multiwave, multisource field survey with 124 supervisor–subordinate dyads. We found that the congruence (incongruence) between supervisor gratitude expression and subordinate preference was positively (negatively) related to subordinate felt appreciation and subsequent voice, with distinct patterns emerging for supervisor agentic and communal expression. Further, in two supplementary experiments, we demonstrated that felt appreciation promotes voice via perceived regard and perceived reduction of relational risk. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, highlighting the importance of distinguishing the two types of supervisor gratitude expressions and their responsiveness to subordinate preferences while outlining promising avenues for research on gratitude and felt appreciation at work.</content>

    <title>Bottom‐up effects of female strategic leadership: Firm performance effects through employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have found that female representation in strategic leadership is often positively associated with firm performance, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Prior explanations emphasize top‐down effects, considering how female leaders shape strategic decision‐making or influence legitimacy. We propose a complementary, bottom‐up view: female top managers foster employee participation, which is positively associated with firm performance. Using a unique panel dataset from South Korea, we find that female representation in top management is linked to higher employee participation, which mediates its relationship with firm performance. The benefits of employee participation are especially pronounced in firms with innovation‐oriented or labor‐intensive strategies. By integrating micro‐level employee behaviors with macro‐level firm outcomes, our study shows how female strategic leaders contribute to firm performance through a top‐enabled, bottom‐up process.Managerial SummaryWhy do firms with more women in top management perform better? Our study suggests that one important pathway lies in how female executives may foster employee participation. Drawing on a unique panel dataset from South Korea, we find that organizations with more women in top management tend to have higher levels of employee participation in decision‐making, and that such participation is associated with stronger performance outcomes. This effect is especially evident in firms that depend on innovation or human capital, where employee input and commitment are particularly valuable. By highlighting how female strategic leaders help create conditions that elevate employee voice, our findings reveal a bottom‐up process through which strategic leadership diversity may support improved organizational performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Considering human motivation, is it more effective to assign work tasks to shop floor workers or let them choose among a set of open tasks? This paper reports the results of a field experiment conducted with a manufacturer that uses wearable devices to distribute shop floor tasks. Drawing on theory on human motivation, we analyze 66,233 machine status reports and 31,429 work tasks completed in two manufacturing plants in Germany and Italy. We rely on a Difference-in-Differences approach in a 13-week-long field experiment. The results show that allowing workers to choose their next task shows no aggregate productivity difference but reveals heterogeneous behavioral effects. We find that workers respond more slowly to tasks (response time), but once accepted, tasks are completed faster (completion time). We discuss the potentially canceling effects and uncover evidence for behavioral mechanisms such as social loafing. This study has significant consequences for production managers in charge of implementing choice-based digital task assignment systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gaming industry has emerged as a critical force in the digital content economy, yet managing user behavior to drive sustained activity and monetization remains a complex operational challenge. In this study, we propose a two-layer Hidden Markov Model to capture users’ gameplay and payment behaviors by constructing a play-then-pay chain that links user engagement to subsequent purchase intention dynamics. Drawing on a real-world dataset, we uncover three levels of engagement states measuring the degree of stickiness with the focal game, as well as two levels of purchase intention states describing one’s willingness to pay. We find that a higher engagement state is associated with a volatile transition pattern and leads to a higher upward transition tendency in purchase intention, while low and medium engagement states tend to maintain a low purchase intention state. We also examine several factors that affect the transitions of these psychological states. The analysis reveals that user activity in same-type games enhances upward transitions only among users in the medium engagement state, without affecting users in the high engagement state, and exhibits no significant effect on purchase intentions. In contrast, user activity in different types of games has a negative effect on users in both low and high engagement states. Our state-dependent outcomes suggest that the managers’ strategies are more effective when targeted toward users with low engagement and purchase intention states. Further experimental analysis supports the effectiveness of the proposed play-then-pay chain for predicting users’ behaviors. Our policy simulation demonstrates that traffic subsidization effectively redirects user attention to the focal game, with interventions targeting different-type games yielding greater improvements in propensities for both gameplay and payment behavior compared to same-type games. Our work provides managerial implications for platform managers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Channel Encroachment and Supply Chain Performance: The Effects of IoT Data Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has enabled IoT device manufacturers to collect consumer usage data (IoT data) whenever their devices are in use. Our paper examines the following setting: A manufacturer collects IoT data and decides whether to share it with a retailer, while consumers remain concerned about their privacy; the retailer, in turn, can leverage the shared data for cross-selling by investing in data-mining efforts that transform raw data into actionable insights. This aspect of data mining differentiates our study from traditional research on information sharing. Beyond selling through the existing retail channel, the manufacturer also has the option to establish a direct channel, thereby encroaching on the retailer’s market. Our analysis reveals several key insights. First, when the manufacturer both encroaches and shares IoT data, we observe a counterintuitive positive effect of the channel substitution rate: As the substitution rate increases, both the manufacturer and the retailer may see higher profits. Second, while the manufacturer always chooses to encroach when data sharing is absent, its motivation to do so weakens when it shares IoT data. Finally, we find that an increase in the value of IoT data can unexpectedly lead to a decline in the retailer’s profit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper “Foresee the Next Line: Customer Strategies and Information Disclosure in Tandem Queues” examines how queue-length information affects customer behavior in multistage services, such as visiting the Apple Store—where you first wait to check in and then wait for a technician. It focuses on a two-stage tandem queue: an admission queue followed by a treatment queue. In the fully observable model, customers see both queues before entering the system, and the equilibrium joining strategy depends on the exact queue lengths rather than just their sum. In the partially observable model—which is more common in practice—customers initially see only the first queue and find the second queue’s length after completing the first stage. In this case, a threshold equilibrium emerges. Comparing models, the partially observable version generally yields higher throughput but lower social welfare. Results combine exact analysis in special regimes with extensive numerical computations.</content>

    <title>Does Personality Similarity Influence the Formation of Auditor-in-Charge–Client Relationships and Audit Quality? Evidence from Swedish Military Conscription Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the role of personality similarity in the formation of auditor-in-charge (AIC)–client management dyads and the development of a collaborative relationship in auditing engagements. We apply the principle of homophily from sociology, that is, the attraction of individuals with similar traits to one another, to the formation of supplier–customer dyads in auditing engagements. Our analyses suggest that AIC–management personality similarity increases the likelihood of dyad formation and facilitates client retention. Using an instrumental variable approach, we further find evidence that AIC–chief executive officer (CEO) personality similarity enhances audit quality, and that this effect is stronger for clients with higher misreporting risk and at the beginning of the AIC–client tenure relationship. Among publicly listed clients, where chief financial officer (CFO) data are available, we find that AIC–CFO personality similarity plays a more important role in AIC–client matching and audit outcomes than AIC–CEO personality similarity. Collectively, our results suggest that a personality homophily-based relationship facilitates collaboration in auditing engagements, ultimately enhancing audit quality. Overall, our evidence highlights the benefit of interpersonal relationships in the production of audit services.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Penn State Smeal College of Business, the Handelsbanken Jan Wallanders and Tom Hedelius Foundation [Grants P25-0334 and W21-0009], the Torsten Söderbergs Foundation [Grant ET4/17], and the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets at the Stockholm School of Economics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04195 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees identify with multiple groups at work, each with distinct values and behavioral expectations. Though the identification literature argues that the relative effects of different identification groups vary depending on their subjective importance and situational relevance, identification is still largely conceptualized as stable, independent, and static. This ignores how different identifications might fluctuate in salience throughout the day and how they might influence each other. We extend the identification literature through the development of a theoretical model of dynamic identification—demonstrating that workplace conflict is a primary mechanism through which identification fluctuates, as well as the simultaneous effects of different identifications (i.e., team and organization) on important workplace outcomes. In a multistudy approach including two ESM studies and supplemental experiments, we demonstrate that increased conflict in a focal group reduced focal group identification salience and that this effect was strengthened when nonfocal group conflict was low, such that the nonfocal identification represented a “greener pasture” compared to the focal group.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the emergence of new technologies (e.g., online payment systems) and new service contexts (e.g., app-based services), the use of tip recommendations is becoming increasingly prevalent. Based on one large secondary dataset analysis (176,237 food delivery orders) and nine experiments, this research identifies an effective and easily implementable tip recommendation design—materially referenced tip recommendations (ie, referencing a product that financially equates to the suggested tip amount) to increase tips. The effect of materially referenced tip recommendations is sequentially driven by the vivid mental imagery of how the requested tips could be used by the recipient (ie, the consequences of tipping for the recipient) and the heightened perception that tipping serves as a meaningful expression of gratitude to the recipient. This effect is attenuated when the referenced product is perceived as inappropriate for expressing gratitude to the tip recipient.</content>

    <title>Strategic Drivers of Core Expansion on Software Platforms: Evidence from Apple iOS</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Software platforms rely on a core-periphery structure; platform owners provide foundational code that third-party developers extend with complementary software. This structure creates strong incentives for platform owners to cooperate with third-party developers. Yet, platform firms, like Apple, intermittently expand their core by integrating peripheral functionality—for instance, flashlight or screen-time tracking in iOS. If ecosystems thrive on cooperation, why do platform owners expand into niches at the apparent expense of developers? Using a comprehensive data set of all Apple iOS core expansions from 2012 to 2020, we find that expansions systematically target underperforming niches—those with low user satisfaction, limited innovation activity, and high market concentration. Stand-alone apps tend to occur in niches with low innovation, whereas integrated core features focus on niches with low user satisfaction and high concentration. For policymakers, these insights inform regulatory discussions on platform power and the design of public interventions. For platform owners and third-party developers, the findings highlight characteristics of ecosystem niches that are vulnerable to core expansion, supporting strategic decisions regarding cooperation, competition, and innovation investment. By linking niche characteristics to core expansion strategies, this study provides actionable guidance for regulating and managing evolving platform ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Throughout history, both human-made crises and natural disasters have displaced populations, forcing people to leave their homes. This not only results in lasting scars on those who flee but can also profoundly impact entire societies. Drawing from the fields of organizational studies, migration studies, and psychology, we argue that understanding the long-term effects of refugee migration requires a comprehensive examination of the entire refugee journey. During pre-, mid-, and postmigration phases, organizational actors play a pivotal role in shaping refugees’ individual and collective experiences. At the individual level, refugees may experience posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic growth. At the collective level, transgenerational trauma evolves into a shared memory, profoundly influencing the long-term outcomes of refugee migration, which is intersected by coping skills and spillover-crossover effects from work to family. By highlighting the intricate interplay between these psychological processes and organizations, we shed light on how much contemporary society has been—and will continue to be—shaped by the opportunities extended to, or withheld from, refugees. We underscore the imperative for organizational scholarship to more clearly theorize refugee migration as distinct from broader migration phenomena and outline a path forward for research, policy, and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Demand in the Shadows: Proxy-Based Solutions for Smarter PricingUnderstanding how price affects customer demand is a cornerstone of data-driven pricing, but traditional approaches often struggle under endogeneity because of the presence of confounding factors. In the paper “Proxy-Aided Demand Learning with an Application to Various Pricing Problems,” Shen and Cui tackle this challenge by leveraging ideas from proximal causal inference. They introduce a framework that incorporates proxy variables—categorized into treatment and outcome types—to enable reliable identification and estimation of customer demand. Central to their method is the use of a bridge function that allows accurate recovery of potential sales at different price points. Besides theoretical and managerial insights, the paper demonstrates practical applications in both static and contextual pricing, with the proposed algorithms applied to a real-world e-commerce data set. Tellingly, the proposed framework offers a promising new direction for practitioners aiming to optimize pricing with confounded data.</content>

    <title>Combining Forecasts from Multiple Experts for Multiple Variables</title>
    <updated>2025-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new method for combining point forecasts from multiple experts across multiple variables to improve inference about an unknown variable. Traditional aggregation methods combine forecasts for each variable separately (we refer to these methods as separate inference methods). However, in practice, each expert frequently provides a forecast for each variable across multiple variables. Because forecast errors can be correlated across the variables, the decision maker may additionally benefit from pooling forecasts for the other variables (we refer to our proposed method as pooled inference). Our model assumes that the forecast error arises from multiple sources of randomness, including a variable-specific factor, an expert-specific factor, a common factor, and idiosyncratic noise. When the covariance structure of the forecast errors is known, we show that the pooled inference is structurally equivalent to the separate inference but with reduced idiosyncratic noise, thereby allowing for more effective weighting of experts’ forecasts. When the covariance structure is unknown, we derive the optimal form for the consensus forecast under the pooled inference, which can be easily implemented. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the pooled inference can outperform widely used separate inference methods in some forecasting environments. Additionally, even when pooling a large number of variables—necessitating the handling of high-dimensional covariance matrices—the pooled inference remains computationally manageable.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The research of Z.

    <title>CEO Pay Ratio Disclosures and Changes in Employee Pay Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether CEO pay ratio disclosures were informative to employees about their own pay by estimating the impact of the disclosures on employee pay satisfaction. Exploiting the staggered timing of the pay ratio disclosures, we find that employee pay satisfaction increased after their firms’ disclosures as measured by their ratings of their firms’ compensation and benefits on Glassdoor. We show that these findings are not driven by alternative information in proxy statements, general trends in employee satisfaction, ratings manipulation, or concurrent changes in employee pay levels. Instead, we posit that the new information in the disclosures about median worker pay levels caused employees to perceive their own pay levels more favorably. Consistent with this explanation, we find that the increases in pay satisfaction are greatest within firms that had relatively small median worker pay levels and those that had relatively opaque pay information environments before the disclosure. Overall, our findings reveal a positive externality of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s mandate on human capital disclosures, potentially informing future policy making.This paper was accepted by Jan Bouwens, accounting.Funding: The authors thank Boston College, Tsinghua University, Tulane University, the University of Arizona, the Carol Lavin Bernick Faculty Grant Program, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72402110, 72442014] for providing financial support for this project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08151 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a no-arbitrage framework for stochastic discount factors (SDFs) that satisfy convex pricing constraints in markets characterized by a wide range of trading frictions. We demonstrate a duality relationship connecting minimum dispersion SDFs to portfolio optimization problems with penalty functions directly capturing the underlying frictions. Empirically, we examine how mispricing impacts the SDF’s effectiveness in explaining both cross-sectional and time series variation in asset returns. We find that a minimum-variance SDF, constructed by combining the capital asset pricing model SDF with a portfolio that constrains the mispricing of nonmarket risks, achieves a favorable tradeoff between time series and cross-sectional fit.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05750 .</content>

    <title>Innovate or litigate? The dual impacts of multimarket contacts on global competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study, grounded in the multimarket competition, knowledge management, and technological change literature, investigates how multimarket contacts among multinational enterprises—i.e., the extent to which rival multinational enterprises meet simultaneously in multiple countries—shape their innovation and patent litigation decisions in host countries. We propose that the degree of multimarket contacts a multinational enterprise has with its competitors in a host country may restrain it from aggressively launching product and technological innovations in that country due to a fear of cross-country retaliation. However, increased multimarket contacts also facilitate knowledge diffusion, heightening the risk of imitation, and consequently enhance the multinational enterprise’s patent litigation intensity—a means to protect knowledge-based resources—in that country. Moreover, we examine how two features of the host-country technological environment—technological ferment (an era of intense technical variation following a technological discontinuity until a dominant design emerges) and home–host country differences in intellectual property protection—moderate these relationships. We test our hypotheses using a dataset of 85 mobile phone vendors, which includes data on their products and technological innovations and litigation cases in 46 countries between 2003 and 2015. This study sheds light on the interplay among multinational enterprises’ multimarket contacts, innovation, and patent litigation.</content>

    <title>The Creation of Immersive Experiences in Transcultural Entertainment: An Action Design Process Focused on Neural Rendering</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically neural facial reenactment (NFR), can address the limitations of dubbing and subtitling in adapting foreign films. Using action design research and guided by presence theory, we codeveloped and evaluated an NFR process during the English adaptation of the Polish feature film The Champion. Unlike conventional dubbing, which often disrupts immersion through poor lip-sync or script changes, NFR preserves the original actors’ performances, aligning them with new dialogue. Independent broadcast-quality assessments confirmed technical validity, and subsequent commercial distribution on a major streaming platform demonstrated scalability and audience acceptance. From this process, we derived six design principles: avoid forced script changes, respect creative intent, minimize intrusive technology, reduce training data requirements, enable flexible audience access, and codesign with existing creative structures. These principles offer a replicable template for the responsible researching and developing of AI in information systems. For practice, the findings show that NFR can improve cultural accessibility and create new creative and technical roles rather than displacing talent. For policy, the study highlights the importance of codesign, transparency, and preserving artistic integrity when integrating AI into global cultural products.</content>

    <title>How to Tell a (News) Story? Quantifying the Impact of News Format and Storytelling on Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media has transformed how people consume news, making storytelling design as important as headline design. We examine three storytelling design features—narrativity (linear versus summary first), emotional sequence (good to bad versus bad to good), and reading level (simple versus complex)—and show that their effects on engagement depend on both news format and audience motivation.We find that effective engagement requires conditional rather than universal rules. For satirical content, humor enhances engagement mainly among motivated audiences, where higher narrativity and complex language paired with bad-to-good emotional sequences work best. For less motivated audiences, simpler satire is more effective when presented in summary-first form with good-to-bad sequences. For traditional news, prior work suggests that simple language helps; whereas we find this to be generally true, our results show that when complex language is unavoidable, pairing it with linear narrativity and bad-to-good sequences can enhance engagement. These results provide guidance for publishers who must balance clarity, complexity, and audience expectations.Beyond news, our findings generalize to videos, podcasts, and interactive media, where storytelling design similarly shaped engagement. We also demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can generate controlled story variations, enabling creators to scale production and platforms to optimize recommendations in audience-specific ways.</content>

    <title>Contract Selection and Piracy Surveillance for Video Platforms in the Age of Social Media</title>
    <updated>2025-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pirated video clips, a new form of piracy, have spread rapidly in recent years with the vigorous development of short‐video social media platforms such asTikTokandDouyin. This has led to a huge loss of revenue for the film and TV drama industry where the negative economic impact trickles down from legitimate video platforms to content creators. As video platforms fight back against copyright infringement, they need to decide how much effort to invest in detecting and taking down pirated video clips that emerge on social media platforms. In addition, they need to decide whether a lump sum or unit price contract should be used to secure the playing rights for a video from the content creator. A content creator has no incentive to engage in piracy surveillance together with the video platform after signing a lump sum contract but has an incentive to do so after signing a unit price contract because he/she would receive royalties each time someone watches the copyrighted video. Using an analytical model framework, we find that the video platform should use a unit price contract when production of the video is less costly for the same quality (e.g., music‐based, horror, and romance movies) but a lump sum contract when production is costly (e.g., Sci‐fi, animation, and fantasy genres). We show that in equilibrium, the total surveillance effort between the video platform and the content creator is smaller and the video platform charges customers less to watch the copyrighted video under the lump sum contract compared to the unit price contract. As a result, the lump sum contract not only achieves higher consumer surplus compared to the unit price contract but also leads to a higher percentage of customers legally accessing the video program. Finally, the content creator's revenue is the same under both contracts, but the content creator may prefer the lump sum contract because it attracts more (legal or illegal) viewers and the increased visibility could be beneficial in the long run.</content>

    <title>The Categorical Paradoxes in the Sharing Economy: Empirical Evidence from Airbnb</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Challenging conventional epistemological stances, we unravel two paradoxes of communication strategies in the emerging context of sharing economy. Specifically, the conformity–distinctiveness paradox asserts that differing from hotels improves hosts’ economic performance, but such economic benefit diminishes when deviating from the norms in hospitality settings. The economic–social paradox propounds that positioning away from hotels improves social performance but may not result in optimal economic gains. Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of strategic categorization and optimal distinctiveness, we collect and analyze data from a sample of Airbnb listings. Utilizing multiple estimation models and identification strategies, we find that hosts can improve their economic performance by differing from hotels, but such economic gains diminish beyond a certain point. Furthermore, deviating from hotels also increases hosts’ social performance, especially when direct host–guest interactions occur in shared apartments. Our empirical findings provide compelling evidence for the two paradoxes in the context of sharing economy, extend the discourse on strategic categorization, and elucidate the effects of listing narratives conveyed through social technologies. This study also sheds new light on how operations management and service providers can exploit the communicative and linguistic perspectives of user-generated content.</content>

    <title>Understanding of the Dynamics of Mobile Reading: An HMM Model of User Engagement and Content Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding consumers’ engagement and subsequent content consumption behavior in the mobile context is critical to mobile app providers. In this paper, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the dynamics of users’ engagement states and consumption decisions on the number of books/chapters read and the amount of money spent. Our method allows us to simultaneously capture three interdependent usage behaviors using a single integrated model and identify the impact of content loading time and previous reading behavior on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption. We calibrate the model using a tap stream data set of individual users’ reading activities on a mobile app. Our analysis reveals three distinct engagement states, a low state with inactive users, a medium state with users sampling books, and a high state with users reading intensively. Furthermore, we find that content loading time has higher negative impacts on high-state users in state transitioning than medium-state users. In contrast, the days that elapsed since the last visit has a similar negative impact on the users in the high and medium states. The effect of usage frequency on users in state transitioning is always positive. We have also identified the weekend effect and social influence on users’ reading outcomes. Finally, our simulations quantify the shortened content loading time and the days elapsed since the last visit on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption decisions, which generate important managerial implications for app providers.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Signaling Blockchain‐Based Track and Trace on Consumer Purchases: Insights From a Quasi‐Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain‐based track and trace (BCT) is increasingly adopted in the retail supply chain. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence quantifying the effects of BCT on consumer purchases or examining the heterogeneity of these effects with varying product‐related characteristics. Employing transactional data from a leading global e‐retailer that contains 540 stock keeping units (SKUs), we design a quasi‐natural experiment spanning 80 weeks to estimate the signaling effect of BCT (i.e., disclosure of the BCT to consumers) on consumer purchases. Drawing on the signaling theory, we propose that BCT can serve as an effective and reliable signal of the product quality and trustworthiness of the retailer. Our research uncovers significant positive effects of BCT on the average purchase quantity per buyer, the total number of buyers, the number of new buyers, and the number of unique visitors to the traced products. We also find nuanced moderation effects for two product‐related characteristics—namely, consumer review inconsistency and product origins—on the influence of BCT on consumer purchases. Specifically, the signal effectiveness of BCT is stronger for products with more inconsistent customer reviews that indicate greater information asymmetry. The effect of BCT for products sourced globally is magnified because of the high BCT signal reliability attributed to the unique properties of the blockchain. The heterogeneous effects of BCT by varying product‐related characteristics can inform managers in selecting the right products to implement BCT.</content>

    <title>Taxes and Executive Pay: Evidence from Nonqualified Deferred Compensation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the influence of tax deductibility on decisions to defer executive compensation by exploiting a plausibly exogenous tax change that increases the deductibility of the chief financial officer’s (CFO’s) nonperformance-based compensation, with no impact on the nontax determinants of deferrals. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I find that CFO deferred compensation significantly decreases after the tax change, relative to the deferrals of the chief executive officer (CEO) and the highest paid non-CEO and non-CFO executive in the same firm. This finding is more pronounced for firms with higher marginal tax rates and thus greater tax benefits of deferrals. Additional tests show that tax deductibility also influences firms’ decisions on nonperformance-based compensation and that CFO total pay appears to decline in response to decreased deferrals.This paper was accepted by Shivaram Rajgopal, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01483 .</content>

    <title>Spectral Volume Models: Universal High-Frequency Periodicities in Intraday Trading Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop spectral volume models to systematically estimate, explain, and exploit the high-frequency periodicity in intraday trading activities using Fourier analysis. The framework consistently recovers periodicities at specific frequencies in three steps, despite their low signal-to-noise ratios. This reveals persistent and universal high-frequency periodicities in the United States and Chinese stock markets in recent years, and the dominant frequencies explain a significant fraction of the total variance of intraday volumes. We provide evidence that this phenomenon likely reflects the behaviors of trading algorithms with repeated and regular trading instructions. Finally, we demonstrate that uncovering such high-frequency periodicities improves intraday volume predictions and volume weighted average price execution qualities, yields insights for price informativeness of algorithmic trading, and generates excess returns.This paper was accepted by William Lin Cong, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant 2022YFA1007900], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12271013 and 72342004], and the Peking University’s Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06215 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Price distortions created by so-called “pump-and-dump” schemes are well documented, but relatively little is known about the investors in these schemes. By examining 470 pump-and-dump schemes and a large data set of trading records for over 110,000 individual investors from a major German bank, we provide comprehensive evidence on the participation rate, the magnitude of the investments, the losses, and the characteristics of the individuals who invest in such schemes. Participation is quite common, with nearly 8% of active retail investors participating in at least one pump-and-dump losing on average nearly 30%. We identify several distinct types of participating investors, some of which (e.g., speculating day trader) should not be viewed as falling prey to the schemes. We also show that portfolio composition and past trading behavior better explain scheme participation than demographics. Last, we document longer-lasting effects on participating investors beyond their immediate financial losses. Our analysis highlights that an effective regulatory response to pump-and-dump schemes requires understanding who invests in such schemes and why, as, for instance, not all investors are likely to be dissuaded from investing by traditional regulatory disclosures.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Clark Center for Global Markets at the University of Chicago and the Danish Finance Institute.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03181 .</content>

    <title>To Claim or Not To Claim? Hidden Costs of Business Page Claiming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many digital platforms encourage small business owners to “claim” their pages to improve visibility and connect with customers. Yet, despite its apparent benefits and zero financial cost, many pages remain unclaimed. Using a unique data set from Yelp and a staggered difference-in-differences design, this study reveals a hidden downside of business page claiming; average customer ratings drop by 10.3%, driven by more one-star reviews and fewer five-star reviews. Customers also write longer, more negative reviews and address owners more directly about service issues. These findings indicate that claiming a business page signals owner presence and raises customer expectations for responsiveness, which many small businesses may not be equipped to meet. For practitioners, the results highlight that business page claiming, although free, is not costless; it creates reputational risk if service quality or responsiveness falls short of heightened expectations. Owners should claim their pages only when ready to actively monitor feedback or engage in managerial responses. Platforms should also communicate these potential consequences to businesses and design tools that help owners manage customer interactions more effectively.</content>

    <title>How Important Is Pay and What Are the Effects (Positive and Negative) of Pay for Performance?: Evaluating Claims and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compensation plays a pivotal role in shaping employee behavior, motivation, and well‐being. Although extant research has explored various dimensions of compensation, questions about how important pay is to employees and concerns (on the part of employers and/or employees) about the unintended negative (in addition to intended positive) consequences of pay and pay for performance (PFP) decisions remain. For employers, these include claims that PFP can provoke undesirable employee behaviors and undermine employee intrinsic motivation and creativity, and that PFP‐related organizational change is difficult to implement successfully. For employees, concerns include claims that PFP programs negatively affect employee health, well‐being, and financial security. We address and evaluate these concerns in light of theory and evidence and emphasize the need to examine not only the potential negative but also the potential positive consequences of pay and PFP decisions. The strength of PFP effects is greater to the degree that pay is important to employees. Further, in the global context, where much of the world has lower income and higher poverty rates than in the higher productivity economies (e.g., the United States, Europe), we often study pay's importance and thus PFP's impact may be greater.</content>

    <title>Microstructure of “Both/And”: SMART Strategies for Simultaneously Engaging Paradoxical Opposites</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The literature on organizational paradoxes emphasizes the importance of both/and thinking and action. Yet, while often treated as a unitary concept, both/and has been interpreted and operationalized in diverse ways—such as ambidexterity, transcendence, Yin-Yang balancing, and Zhong-Yong middle way. To enhance conceptual clarity and coherence, this paper decomposes the notion of both/and and identifies generic strategies for simultaneously engaging paradoxical opposites. I begin by reviewing individual responses and prior classifications of responses to paradoxical tensions, which reveals five distinct responses beyond either/or logics. Building on these, I develop a typology that specifies and relates five variants of both/and thinking. These are organized into five ideal types—superficial Either-And, multiversal Both-Or, ambivalent Both-And, reconciliatory Both-Nor, and transcendent Neither-And—collectively forming the acronym SMART. I illustrate the application of the SMART framework by analyzing how organizations navigate the profitability versus responsibility tension, a paradox central to modern business practice. I conclude the paper by identifying the limitations of the present study and avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>When Local Learning Scales: Entrepreneurs’ Initial Users and Market Expansion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entering new markets is crucial for technology startups to scale, yet these ventures often face high uncertainty about demand in these markets. This study examines how the composition of initial users shapes startups’ new market growth amid such uncertainty. It theorizes that startups face a learning tradeoff when targeting a foreign market: Local initial users, who are more familiar to the startups, provide clearer signals due to shared language and norms; however, more representative foreign users provide more transferable insights about the target market. Using variation in feature timing on a product platform, this study finds that startups with a higher share of local initial users prior to platform launch experience greater growth in foreign users afterward. This effect is stronger when startups are based in more linguistically homogeneous countries and operate in globally standardized digital product categories, settings where the clarity benefits of local signals outweigh their transferability costs. In contrast to prior work suggesting that startups should begin with target users, this study reveals contexts when more familiar initial users can better foster new market growth and prevent premature scaling.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17983 .</content>

    <title>Behavioral Simulation of Blockchain-Enabled Market for Supplier Capacity Trading Among Retailers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain distribution system and investigate experimentally operations of markets where retailers can trade digital claims (tokens) on the supplier’s capacity. Subjects play the role of retailers, have heterogeneous valuations of goods, face random demands, and buy tokens on the supplier’s capacity. Following demand realization, retailers trade tokens with each other in markets implemented as double-sided, single-price, blind, batch auctions. We compare six behavioral treatments, featuring two wholesale prices and three market sizes. As expected, markets reduce leftovers and shortages. Interestingly, market-clearing prices are anchored to wholesale prices and do not signal the value of goods in large markets. Players deploy novel ordering and trading strategies that differ from the transshipment literature. We identify strategies by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In one strategy, players buy a few claims and, after demand realization, use the market to satisfy it. Other players buy more claims than the maximum demand and, once demand is known, sell their excess on the market. Both strategies reduce costs from demand uncertainty but expose players to liquidity and mistakes risks. A third strategy, in which players order from the supplier initially as if expecting the market to be cleared cooperatively, is more profitable. This strategy diversifies demand and market risks. The introduction of markets causes the “pull-to-the-mean” effect and increases order variability. Thus, markets can cause the Bullwhip Effect. Retailers’ and the supply chain’s average profits are higher with markets, but suppliers with low wholesale prices suffer from lower revenues because of the pull-to-the-mean effect.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03771 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Direct experience of a peer’s punishment might have a sobering effect above and beyond deterrence (information about punishments). We test this mechanism in China, studying the reactions to listed state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) punishments for fraudulent loan guarantees by firms in the same location (peers) and nonpeer firms across SOEs and non-SOEs. After experiencing SOEs’ punishments, peer SOEs cut their loan guarantees by more than nonpeer SOEs and peer non-SOEs even if information and local economic shocks are common to all firms. The reaction is stronger for peer SOEs whose CEOs have higher career concerns and/or face lower costs of reducing loan guarantees.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03309 .</content>

    <title>Representing Random Utility Choice Models with Neural Networks</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the successes of deep learning, we propose a class of neural network–based discrete choice models, called RUMnets, inspired by the random utility maximization (RUM) framework. This model formulates the agents’ random utility function using a sample average approximation. We show that RUMnets sharply approximate the class of RUM discrete choice models: Any model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a RUMnet. Reciprocally, any RUMnet is consistent with the RUM principle. Our approach is closely related to ranking-based models and mixtures of multinomial logits proposed in previous literature in a more general contextual setting. We derive an upper bound on the generalization error of RUMnets fitted on choice data and provide theoretical insights on their ability to predict choices on new unseen data depending on critical parameters of the data set and architecture. The models are estimated by leveraging open-source libraries for training neural networks. We find that RUMnets are competitive against several choice modeling and machine learning methods in terms of predictive accuracy on two real-world data sets. We also conduct synthetic experiments that isolate the effects of each architecture component.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: A.

    <title>Whence LASSO? A Rational Interpretation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an economic setting to rationalize the use of the “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator” (LASSO) in estimating asset returns. In this setting, multiple traders engage in trading based on information extracted from historical asset prices. Facing model uncertainty in forecasting asset returns, these traders adopt robust-trading strategies. Within this context, the use of LASSO for estimating asset returns emerges endogenously as an equilibrium outcome. We further extend our analysis to rationalize the application of elastic-net estimation. Although LASSO-type strategies enhance traders’ profits by mitigating competition among them, they also introduce biases in trading decisions, which can adversely affect profitability. This dual effect highlights the nuanced tradeoffs associated with employing such estimation techniques in financial markets.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on AI for Finance and Business Decisions.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2021-0040] and the Bank of Canada [Fellowship].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06127 .</content>

    <title>Breaking Barriers: Scaffolding Social‐Symbolic Work for Women’s Economic Empowerment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances the understanding of Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) in non‐Western contexts by theorizing how social‐symbolic work facilitates empowerment despite entrenched institutional and cultural constraints. Drawing on a qualitative study into the establishment of Kuwait’s first women’s business incubator, we explore how female intrapreneurs engaged in three interrelated forms of social‐symbolic work – on selves, organizations, and institutions – to foster women’s entrepreneurship. These scaffolded efforts culminated in the creation of a new social‐symbolic object: the Al Salam business incubator. This incubator functioned not only as a physical space for women to launch and grow businesses, but also as a potent symbol of institutional transformation within a culturally traditional environment. We propose a process model of scaffolding social‐symbolic work, demonstrating how catalytic partnerships and dynamic interdependencies across multiple levels of social life can collectively dismantle systemic barriers to female entrepreneurship. By conceptualizing scaffolding as a temporal and integrative process, this study contributes to WEE scholarship and deepens theoretical insights into social‐symbolic work by revealing how diverse forms of work interlock to shape new identities, practices, and institutional arrangements.</content>

    <title>How Institutional Context Affects Narcissistic CEOs’ CSR Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narcissistic CEOs have been found to invest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) in prior research, but the empirical results are not straightforward. To address this, we bring in the institutional context as a moderator. We build on neo-institutional theory to argue that the institutional context shapes what audiences value and find legitimate in terms of CSR behaviors: Corporate philanthropy, a form of tactical CSR, is appreciated in liberal market economies (LMEs) but less so in coordinated market economies (CMEs), whereas strategic CSR, which requires a long-term horizon and substantial resource investments, is considered legitimate in CMEs but less so in LMEs. We theorize that narcissistic CEOs will try to pursue excellence (among their peers) in CSR activities that align with the norms and expectations in their institutional context in order to gain praise and avoid disapproval from their audiences and to bolster their moral superiority. Hence, we expect that the institutional context will moderate the relationship between CEO narcissism and CSR behavior such that in LMEs narcissistic CEOs will engage more in philanthropy than their peers but not in strategic CSR, whereas in CMEs they will invest more in strategic CSR but not in philanthropy. We test our predictions using panel data (2002-2023) from 148 large firms and 493 CEOs operating in 18 countries. Our pattern of findings supports our theory. By developing and testing a theoretical mechanism that connects macro-level institutional context with micro-level firm and CEO behavior, we contribute to both strategic leadership and CSR literature.</content>

    <title>Compromise Leadership: Competing Board Subgroups and the Appointment of a Newcomer Chair</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research suggests that firm-specific human capital is important in enabling board chairs to effectively lead their boards in their oversight duties. Despite this, some boards appoint newcomer directors to the chair position. This paper seeks to explain why. Building on power circulation and faultline theories, we posit that boards characterized by strongly divided subgroups with none dominant over the board may have difficulty in agreeing on promoting a director from among their ranks to the chair position, and instead select a board newcomer as a compromise solution. We further argue that this will be moderated by factors that affect either the power dynamics or the degree of contestation on the board. Analyses on a sample of 2,199 board chair appointments at S&amp;P 1500 firms between the years 2001 and 2017 support our hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Gender wage discrimination and the attractiveness of foreign MNC subsidiaries as employers for women</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender wage discrimination is a grand challenge that constrains economic growth worldwide and denies women fair opportunities. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how women’s own experiences of wage discrimination steer their career decisions. We adopt the perspective of job-seeking women and argue that prior exposure to wage discrimination reshapes their employer preferences. Specifically, it can flip the liability of foreignness typically faced by foreign MNCs into a perceived employer advantage because foreign MNCs can deviate from the host country’s gender-biased norms. We study this mechanism for 165,624 female professionals and managers who changed jobs in Denmark between 2002 and 2015, using a pay transparency law from 2006 for identifying the underlying mechanism. We find that women who have suffered larger wage discrimination in domestic employment are more likely to start working for foreign MNC subsidiaries. This effect is weaker in labor markets in which high-performing domestic employers can offer other benefits, such as reputation or job security. The effect is stronger when foreign MNC subsidiaries signal gender fairness through a higher share of women in management. Overall, our findings show how wage discrimination redirects female career paths, transforming a grand challenge into a strategic advantage for foreign MNCs.</content>

    <title>Third-country MNEs, trade wars, and competitive opportunities: a real-options perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While geopolitical conflicts, including trade wars, have garnered substantial scholarly attention in recent years, the impact on the outsider firms not directly involved in such conflicts remains underexplored. Engaging in real-options informed analysis, we examine how MNEs from third countries may respond to trade wars by capitalizing on the potential for competitive opportunities: where trade wars prompt the scaling up of third-country subsidiary operations in the involved countries. We further explore how the strategic responses of third-country MNEs to the opportunities presented by a trade war can be enhanced by the strategic flexibility manifest in parent-MNE multinationality, the resources and networks embedded in local partners, and the presence of bilateral economic agreements. Employing the 2018 US–China trade war as an empirical context, our panel data encompass 3601 Chinese subsidiary operations for outsider MNEs hailing from 51 countries, which yields 14,404 annual subsidiary-level observations to conduct difference-in-differences analysis. The empirical results indicate that third-country MNEs disproportionately expanded their Chinese operations in response to the US–China tariff conflict, and that these strategic responses were pronounced for subsidiaries with highly multinational parents, local partnerships in the involved country, and a home–host country bilateral agreement.</content>

    <title>Can Crowdchecking Curb Misinformation? Evidence from Community Notes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, whereas traditional countermeasures struggle to balance effectiveness, scalability, and free expression. Many platforms are now experimenting with crowdsourced fact-checking—systems that rely on users’ collective judgment to identify and annotate misleading content. This paper investigates the efficacy of such systems in curbing misinformation in the context of Community Notes, a pioneering crowdsourced fact-checking system from Twitter/X. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that publicly displaying community notes significantly increases and accelerates the voluntary retraction of misleading tweets, demonstrating the viability of crowd-based fact-checking as an alternative to professional fact-checking and forcible content removal. The effect is primarily driven by authors’ reputational concerns and social pressure when corrections are visible to the public. Our findings carry meaningful implications for practice and policy. Individuals can play an active role by contributing to crowdchecking, strengthening collective information integrity. Platforms should adopt transparent, community-based systems, like Community Notes, as scalable, less controversial alternatives to forcible content removal. Policymakers can support these initiatives through regulatory guidance that promotes transparency and accountability.</content>

    <title>The role of identity in corporate governance: evidence from gender differences in the audit committee chair-chief financial officer dyad</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the role of identity in corporate governance, focusing on an important dyad: audit committee chair and chief financial officer. Drawing on identity theory, which argues that people have lower trust in those they perceive to be different from themselves, we posit that the audit committee chair’s trust in the chief financial officer is lower when the two are different genders. We find that a gender difference between the two is associated with greater monitoring by the chair, consistent with lower trust. This effect is attenuated when a firm has value-based controls that promote diversity tolerance or when a chief financial officer seems more trustworthy. We find no evidence that the increased monitoring improves financial reporting. However, we find evidence that the increased monitoring generates negative externalities by distracting the chief financial officer, as proxied by lower operational performance. Our findings underscore the importance of identity in corporate governance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies’ strategic alternatives announcements lead to negative future stock returns. First, we investigate whether this anomaly exists. We demonstrate that it is significant and pervasive across years, industries, firm size, and information environments and that it is not driven by confounding variables nor risk. We then investigate why the market misprices the announcements and find that investors appear overly optimistic about a potential merger or acquisition and do not fully incorporate the negative fundamental news conveyed by the announcement. Meanwhile, short sellers exploit the mispricing. We also evaluate market frictions as limits to arbitrage. This study’s contributions are (i) evaluating behavioral and risk explanations for an event that causes extreme stock returns, (ii) challenging investors’ widely held belief that such announcements reflect good news, and (iii) warning investors and analysts about a behavioral bias they might unknowingly adopt.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Process Flexibility Analysis for Production Systems with Differentiated Margins under Supply Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To mitigate supply and demand uncertainties, firms often design highly flexible production networks. This study investigates process flexibility in production systems subject to supply disruptions and stochastic demands with differentiated profit margins. In particular, we model supply disruptions as failures of arcs in the network, with node-based disruptions treated as a special case in which all arcs connected to a node simultaneously fail. To address the cost implications of such disruptions, we investigate the design of process flexibility under a robust optimization framework. We first develop a greedy algorithm under deterministic demand to efficiently evaluate the worst-case disruption scenario, and demonstrate the significant advantage of the alternate long-chain design under such disruptions. Subsequently, under stochastic demand, by introducing themarginal profit group index under disruption(MPGID), we characterize the worst-case total profit as a function of both the flexibility design and demand uncertainty, modeled through a partwise independently symmetric perturbation set. This representation enables direct performance comparisons across different flexibility configurations under disruption risk. For the case involving two products with distinct profit margins under supply disruption risk, we demonstrate that the alternate long-chain design outperforms all other long-chain configurations in terms of worst-case profitability. In addition, in certain cases, arc-based disruptions can be just as devastating as plant-node disruptions, particularly when they lead to the loss of high-margin demand. However, our fragility analysis reveals that this design becomes increasingly vulnerable as disruption risks intensify. To address this issue, we propose an MPGID-based heuristic that systematically generates flexible designs to mitigate both supply and demand uncertainties.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;SOAR ing to Optimality: Smarter Matching Algorithms for On-Demand PlatformsIn “Feature-Based Dynamic Matching,” Y. Chen, Y. Kanoria, A. Kumar, and W. Zhang study dynamic two-sided matching where both customers and service providers are characterized by high-dimensional feature vectors, motivated by platforms like on-demand home services. A key finding is that myopic greedy policies—which match each customer to the best available provider—can be highly suboptimal. The authors introduce SOAR (simulate-optimize-assign-repeat), a forward-looking algorithm that balances immediate match quality against preserving valuable supply for future arrivals. Through a novel analytical framework connecting dynamic matching to empirical optimal transport, they prove SOAR achieves near-optimal regret scaling under various distributional assumptions, establishing fundamental performance limits for feature-based matching problems and as a by-product resolve an open problem from prior work on dynamic spatial matching.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study household finance in the age of FinTech, where digital payments are integrated with various financial services through all-in-one super apps. We hypothesize that increased FinTech adoption via digital payments can lower the nonmonetary costs (e.g., psychological barriers) associated with financial market participation. We find that higher FinTech adoption leads to greater participation and increased risk taking in mutual fund investments. Using distance from Ant as an instrument for FinTech penetration, as well as the exogenous penetration of QRPay in Shenzhen, we further provide causal evidence from digital payment to risky fund investment. Moreover, the effect of FinTech is stronger among individuals who are otherwise more constrained, those with higher risk tolerance, or those living in under-banked counties.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a conditional model of asset returns that allows for good and bad states of the world, depending on bear market risk. Specifically, we generalize existing latent factor models in three ways: we show how to estimate the threshold that identifies the “disappointment” event triggering the bad state of the world, we permit different factor structures for asset returns in good and bad states, and we show how to estimate consistently the conditional risk premia of observable factors from the estimated latent factors. The usefulness of the conditional model is illustrated with an empirical application to a broad cross-section of stock portfolio excess returns.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04276 .</content>

    <title>Tweeting for Money: Social Media and Mutual Fund Flows</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We unveil asset managers’ social media communications as a distinct new channel for attracting flows of money to mutual funds. Combining a database of more than 1.6 million posts on X/Twitter by U.S. mutual fund families with textual analysis, we find that flows of money to mutual funds respond positively to both the number and tone of the posts. Whereas the link between social media communications and flows of money is not explained by conventional marketing efforts, our findings suggest that the social media channel is not independent from asset management companies’ broader marketing strategies. A high-frequency analysis that exploits intraday ETF trade data allows us to isolate the effect of tweets on investor decisions from potential confounders. We then consider and test four different economic mechanisms. The results of these tests do not support the hypothesis that asset managers’ social media communications reduce search costs for potential investors. The results do not support, either, that asset management companies’ Twitter activity increases investor attention or alleviates information asymmetries by communicating performance-relevant information to investors. In contrast, our evidence suggests that asset managers use social media as an effective persuasion tool.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: Both authors acknowledge financial support from the FinTech &amp; Digital Finance Chair at Paris Dauphine - PSL.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the additivity of expectations over different time intervals. For example, when asked about 10-year stock price growth, survey respondents report an expected change that is not equal to, but closer to zero than, the sum of their expectations over two shorter time intervals that cover the same 10 years. Such subadditivity, which we also find in expectations for other economic variables, is irrational, as it cannot stem from aggregating short-term expectations. Model estimates show that the pattern is consistent with a time perception where shorter time intervals have a proportionally larger weight. We also find that the respondents’ degree of additivity is correlated with making larger financial investments.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Science Foundation) via CRC TRR 190 [Grant 280092119].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01558 .</content>

    <title>Government Deleveraging and the Reverse Crowding-In Effect: Evidence from Subnational Debt and Government Contractors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document a novel trade-credit channel through which government deleveraging affects the private economy. Our empirical analysis exploits China’s 2017 deleveraging campaign that reduced local governments’ net financing capacity and a purpose-built data set of listed firms matched with government procurement contracts. Compared with noncontractors, private contractors experience larger increases in accounts receivable and deterioration in financial conditions, leading to fewer investments, worse operating performance, and higher probabilities of ownership changes. The effects are muted among state-owned enterprises, which demonstrate lower productivity. Our findings thus reveal a reverse crowding-in effect whereby government deleveraging adversely affects private firms and reduces allocative efficiency.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05679 .</content>

    <title>From Food Deserts to Fresh Food: The Role of Digital Accessibility in Nutrition Assistance Programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in 10 U.S. households experience food insecurity, with millions of low-income families lacking access to fresh food. In response, federal and state governments recently launched the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Online Purchasing Pilot (SNAP Online), enabling SNAP benefits to cover online food purchases. Although prior research suggests that the SNAP Online program may increase overall food consumption, its impact on fresh food consumption remains unclear. This research leverages NielsenIQ consumer panel data and employs a Difference-in-Differences approach to address this question. Our findings reveal that the SNAP Online program increases fresh food consumption among low-income households by 7.1%. However, the effect is minimal in areas with limited access to online grocery delivery and among households with poor prior fresh food consumption habits. These results underscore the potential of supply-side policies, such as expanding online purchasing options, to improve fresh food consumption. They also highlight the importance of addressing demand-side barriers and enhancing digital accessibility to maximize the effectiveness of nutrition assistance programs.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>EXPRESS: Out of Control: The Interplay of Subjective Poverty and Income on Spending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ spending decisions are shaped not only by their objective financial resources but also by their subjective perceptions of wealth. This research investigates the interplay between subjective poverty (e.g., feeling financially constrained) and income in driving spending. Across five studies including real-world spending data from a U.K. financial management app, longitudinal surveys from Kenya and the United States, and controlled experiments, the authors reveal that subjective poverty increases spending among higher-income consumers but decreases spending among lower-income consumers. That is, wealthy consumers who feel financially poor tend to spend more, whereas poorer consumers who feel financially constrained tend to reduce their spending. Drawing on compensatory control theory, the authors demonstrate that subjective poverty threatens individuals’ sense of personal control over life, but people cope with this diminished sense of control differently based on their available resources. Higher-income individuals engage in compensatory consumption to restore control, while lower-income individuals adopt different strategies, including reduced spending. This research advances the understanding of how psychological and material dimensions of wealth interact to shape consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The unique characteristics of the health care industry have given rise to an intriguing and pervasive form of joint venture between hospitals and physicians known as Physician–Hospital Organization (PHO). With transaction cost analysis as the overarching theory, the authors draw on practitioner insights and literature to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of PHOs and identify the boundary conditions under which PHOs are more likely to enhance patient satisfaction. They test the proposed model using multiyear panel data from 19,134 observations in the U.S. health care industry. The results underscore PHOs’ capability to enhance patient satisfaction with hospital services. The significant main effect grows stronger when the market is characterized by intense competition among hospitals, high mortality rates, urban settings, and high unemployment rates. The post hoc analysis reveals that PHOs can additionally improve patient recommendation of a hospital indirectly through patient satisfaction. This study contributes to research on governance structure and customer satisfaction by establishing a connection between PHO and patient satisfaction and identifying its boundary conditions. The findings highlight several fertile avenues for research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the relation between audit competition, audit quality, and auditor labor hours. Using proprietary data on auditor realization rates, we construct new measures of competition based on theory predicting that abnormal profits will quickly disappear when competition is high but persist over multiple periods when competition is low. We find consistent evidence of persistent abnormal profits among U.S. Big 4 engagements and that individual offices earn persistent abnormal returns, suggesting that the market is not perfectly competitive. Examining the consequences of lower competition, we find that profit persistence is negatively related to audit hours and positively related to audit quality. Although we are cautious about inferring causality, our findings suggest that lower competition is associated with more efficient and effective audits.</content>

    <title>Agent-Based Data Curation Practices: Customer Responses to Human versus Algorithmic Data Requesters in Established Business-to-Business Relationships</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increasing value generated through data curation and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) agents that act as human agents, vendor companies in established business-to-business relationships increasingly delegate data curation tasks to algorithmic data requesters (ADRs) instead of human data requesters (HDRs). Using a randomized field experiment with a European pharmaceutical company and a follow-up online experiment, we show how customers respond to ADRs versus HDRs across two tasks: data enrichment (i.e., adding new information) and data reconciliation (i.e., updating existing records). For data enrichment, customers are more likely to agree and complete requests sent by ADRs because they expect lower effort. For data reconciliation requests, customers lean toward HDRs, reflecting stronger accuracy concerns. Interestingly, we observe only a marginal advantage in completion rates for HDRs. These findings advise vendors to match agents to data curation tasks; they should deploy ADRs for data enrichment to reduce customer burden, and they should use HDRs for data reconciliation to address error concerns. Relatedly, vendors should craft emails that match the messaging context; they should frame data enrichment messages around convenience and benefits, and they should frame data reconciliation messages around accuracy, auditability, and risk reduction.</content>

    <title>The coevolution of board interlock networks and corporate strategic actions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies on board interlock networks are divided into two streams, one examining their dynamics; the other, their consequences. We propose that both phenomena—board interlock dynamics and consequences—are interdependent. Applying structuration theory, we explain and empirically demonstrate how firms' corporate strategic actions (specifically, acquisitions and divestitures) influence the creation and dissolution of different types of board interlock network ties and how these interlock ties, in turn, influence firms' corporate strategic actions. Integrating the two research streams, we complement corporate governance literature by demonstrating how corporate strategic actions and certain types of board interlocks coevolve. We contribute to theory on strategic networks by explaining coevolution through a structuration theoretical lens. Lastly, we illustrate methodological advances by using multiplex stochastic actor‐oriented models to analyze coevolution processes.Managerial SummaryThe dynamics of board interlock networks—networks resulting from executive and non‐executive directors serving on multiple boards—and the consequences of such networks have been treated as disjunct topics in prior research. We argue and show empirically that certain types of a firm's board interlocks and its corporate strategic actions (specifically, acquisitions and divestitures) are mutually dependent. Applying network analysis to a longitudinal sample of large German firms, we find that firms adapt their actions to the actions of those firms they have directed interlocks with. Vice versa, corporate strategic actions influence the creation and dissolution of board interlocks. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of board interlock networks play a more prominent role in firms' corporate strategic decisions than commonly assumed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the valuation of state-issued tax-exempt municipal bonds and find that there are significant convenience premia in their prices. These premia parallel those identified in Treasury markets. We find evidence that these premia are tax related. Specifically, the premia are related to measures of tax and fiscal uncertainty, forecast flows into state municipal bond funds, and are directly linked to outmigration from high-tax to low-tax states and to other measures of tax aversion such as IRA and retirement plan contributions. These results suggest that investors are willing to pay a substantial premium to avoid taxes. (JEL G12, G28)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;User-generated content platforms use recommendation systems (RSs) to deliver content from a vast number of creators to a diverse audience based on content quality and its match to consumers’ tastes. Existing research has primarily examined their impact on demand-side factors, such as the quality and variety of content consumption. In contrast, less attention has been paid to their influence on supply-side factors, including creators’ entry and quality decisions and their interaction with users’ content diets. The literature has also largely overlooked the hit-driven nature of content production—where a few “trendy” items attract outsized interest in unpredictable ways. We address these omissions by explicitly modeling creators’ entry and quality decisions. We reveal a tradeoff between the equilibrium content quality and variety produced on a platform. Although increasing the recommended content’s fit to users’ preferences benefits consumers and the platform, emphasizing higher quality may reduce content variety and the emergence of trendy items, potentially lowering overall consumer valuation of the platform. We show that whether emphasizing the quality dimension is detrimental depends on consumers’ valuations for content match and trendiness, the heterogeneity level of their valuations, creators’ capabilities of flexibly choosing their content types, and their barrier to enter the platform. Additionally, consumption variety is a U-shaped function of the emphasis the recommendation system puts on content quality.This paper was accepted by Greg Shaffer, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2025.00300 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that migration induced by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicts changes in municipal bond yields. Negative migration shocks have made debt more expensive, especially in the areas and bonds most exposed to the work-from-home (WFH) transition. Over the full sample, a one-standard-deviation increase in COVID period out-migration predicts an approximate 4.5-basis-point rise in municipal bond yields, after controlling for a range of local economic factors including state- or core-based statistical area (CBSA)-year fixed effects. This effect is 40% larger for areas in the top decile of WFH exposure and approximately twice as large for transportation-backed bonds. Moreover, areas containing the most exposed bonds (i.e., those with out-migration and high WFH exposure) also experience relatively large post-COVID declines in municipal revenue. Overall, our results suggest that investors have changed their estimates of the level or uncertainty of municipalities’ future cash flows, especially for areas and bonds most exposed to the transition toward remote work.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02674 .</content>

    <title>Firms’ Stock Prices, Stock Returns, and Remaining Lifetime Earnings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document the disconnect between earnings expectations as captured in stock prices and the ultimate realization of earnings over long periods. To do so, we compare firms’ stock prices on the first trading day and the beginning of each year to the realized earnings over their remaining lifetime (RLTEP ratio). We document that the RLTEP ratio, averaged over long periods and over 15,000 U.S. domestic public firms, approximates one, suggesting that expectations match actuals in the aggregate. However, most firms fail to deliver an RLTEP ratio greater than one. Acquisition prices are the largest contributors to the RLTEP ratio, with many surviving firms failing to generate enough earnings even after operating for between 15 and 45 years. The RLTEP ratio for survivors is positively associated with the future RLTEP ratio, future lifetime wealth creation, and future lifetime stock returns. Significant returns-based wealth creation by firms in the short term does not persist in the long term unless it is supported by fundamental wealth creation (high past RLTEP ratio).This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Financial support from SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Columbia Business School, Columbia University, Binghamton University School of Management, and Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03251 .</content>

    <title>Why Do Product Prices Affect Review Ratings? Evidence from a Japanese Online Travel Agency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine why the prices that consumers pay influence their ratings of products. In the context of hotel reviews on an online booking platform, I find that prices have larger impact on ratings when consumers face larger uncertainty about hotel quality, indicating that prices affect satisfaction through consumers’ quality expectation. On the other hand, I find that the mere fact that the reviewer received higher surplus through a lower price by itself is not a primary reason for a higher rating. I also present suggestive evidence of consumer reciprocation, in which consumers experiencing a high-quality staff service likely become more forgiving of higher prices. I show that introductory pricing can have a substantial impact on the distribution of review rankings among new entrants because of the role of prices as quality signals. Understanding the price effect on ratings is crucial to designing review systems robust to potential distortion.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05043 .</content>

    <title>Advancing Abductive Theory Building: Balancing Creative Curiosity and Programmatic Rigour Through ‘Loosely Coupled Abduction’</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Abductive theory building holds much promise for management research. Unlike induction and deduction, abductive theorizing begins with a surprising fact or ‘mystery’ that cannot be accounted in extant knowledge stocks. However, emergent debates about its utility in management research risk becoming polarized, with some scholars promoting abduction as creative guesswork on the one hand (or what we termuncoupled abduction) and others calling for more disciplined programmatic rigour on the other hand (or what we termtightly coupled abduction). Both poles are problematic. In thisPointessay, we develop a middle ground, which we termloosely coupled abduction. It benefits from both creative curiosity and programmatic rigour without succumbing to their respective disadvantages in theory construction. We go on to explore the implications of loosely coupled abduction for building new knowledge in management and organization studies.</content>

    <title>Trade Wars, International Supply Chains, and Business Associations: Historical Evidence from Norway and Portugal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines the 1921–1923 trade war between Norway and Portugal as a historical case for exploring business responses to deglobalization and trade disruption. Focusing on the international supply chains (ISCs) of port wine and salted and dried cod, it investigates how business actors contributed to the recoupling of ISCs after a trade war. Drawing on a history‐to‐theory methodology and extensive archival research, the study offers new theoretical insights into how institutional environments shape business agency during periods of deglobalization. It develops a typology of trade wars structured around two dimensions: the degree of coordination within ISCs and the economic reach of the conflict. The findings demonstrate that, in processes ofsymmetric recoupling, where both nations restore disrupted supply chains on equal terms, business associations as well as multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a pivotal role in business diplomacy and supply‐chain reconstruction. The symmetric nature of the post‐trade war recoupling fosters mutual recovery and enhances long‐term competitiveness for the industries involved. The typology proposed also provides a framework for analysing other historical and contemporary trade wars across diverse geopolitical settings.</content>

    <title>Purposeful Management and the Public Good: Relationships, Tensions, and Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional management practices have long prioritized organizational performance and financial growth, primarily serving shareholder interests. However, escalating societal and environmental challenges – such as climate change, human rights violations, the dismantling of democratic institutions, and public health crises – raise questions about the adequacy of these priorities and call for greater attention to management’s role in advancing the public good. This Special Issue examines the relationships, tensions, and consequences associated with efforts to repurpose management towards broader societal aims. We distinguish between organizational purpose – the stated aspirational goals of firms – and repurposed management, which reflects broader shifts in managerial logic, practices, and institutional expectations aimed at serving the public good. The contributing articles explore how such repurposing is constructed and enacted across institutional settings, and how managerial practices influence governance structures, stakeholder dynamics, and field‐level norms to shape public outcomes – both intended and unintended. By shifting the analytical lens from purpose as internal intent to purpose as institutionally mediated consequence, we invite more inquiry into how, when, and for whom purposeful management contributes to the public good – foregrounding the institutional mechanisms, stakeholder dynamics, and societal outcomes through which purpose is interpreted, negotiated and enacted.</content>

    <title>How Do SMEs Respond to Deglobalization? Insights from Italian SMEs in the Interwar Period (1936–1943)</title>
    <updated>2025-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) respond to deglobalization and economic nationalism, using historical evidence from fascist Italy, a period of autarky and restricted international trade. While prior research has focused primarily on larger firms, especially multinational enterprises (MNEs), the strategic behaviour of the resource‐constrained category of SMEs remains underexplored in both management and business history literatures. Drawing on archival material from the Istituto Mobiliare Italiano and historical sources, we identify four adaptive strategies: (i) market repositioning, (ii) national re‐branding, (iii) disguising core business, and (iv) mobilizing formal ties. Our findings reveal that, while SMEs draw from the strategic playbook of MNEs, they implement these strategies in distinct ways due to internal and external constraints. In doing so, they exhibit both strategic and political ambidexterity to adapt. They leverage their distinctive flexibility and agility by mobilizing internal capabilities (e.g., brand identity), and resources (e.g., formal international ties). This enables SMEs’ market repositioning and allows them to achieve symbolic alignment with government agendas through reshaping narratives to secure critical resources. Ultimately, this leads to bolder strategies like pivoting from global niche to broader domestic markets. This framework offers insights into SMEs’ resilience under deglobalization and economic nationalism.</content>

    <title>Curse or Blessing: Investigating the Influence of Firms’ Artificial Intelligence Adoption on Employee Job Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) growing influence in business has introduced a pivotal shift in workplace dynamics. However, the understanding of how AI adoption influences employee job satisfaction remains inconclusive. Drawing on job characteristics theory, we argue that with increasing levels of adoption, the relationship between employees’ perceived benefits and costs of AI changes, resulting in an inverted U‐shaped relationship between AI adoption and job satisfaction. We further propose that the firm‐level contingencies exploration orientation and data governance moderate the effects of AI adoption on job satisfaction. Using longitudinal data from 509 publicly listed US firms between 2009 and 2020, we find broad support for our hypotheses. To better understand how specific job characteristics may explain these relationships, we conducted follow‐up interviews with employees from our sample firms. Our study contributes to the AI adoption literature by highlighting the previously neglected interplay of enrichment and impairment effects that drive job satisfaction at varying levels of adoption. We also show that firm‐level strategies shape how employees perceive AI‐driven changes to their jobs and provide a nuanced view of how a job characteristics perspective can help organizational scholars and practitioners understand the multifaceted effects of AI on work environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a continuous-time model examining agency conflicts among controlling shareholders (managers), minority shareholders, and creditors in corporate investment decisions. The manager’s private benefits encourage overinvestment, while their equity stake and debt overhang lead to underinvestment. We show these offsetting incentive effects can achieve optimal investment timing under certain conditions. Agency costs exhibit U-shaped relationships with private benefits, tax rates, volatility, managerial ownership, and leverage. The model reveals how the interplay among agency conflicts, tax benefits, and bankruptcy costs shapes optimal ownership and capital structure, explaining several documented empirical patterns in corporate finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel data set of misconduct records for Finnish CEOs and directors and their parents, we explore whether corporate executives’ financial misconduct is associated with similar behavior by their parents. Controlling for various other factors of executive financial misconduct, we find that executives are significantly more likely to engage in financial misconduct, including accounting, tax, and other financial offenses, if their parents have a history of financial misconduct. This intergenerational association is stronger when the parental misconduct is more severe. Additional findings reveal that growing up in high‐misconduct municipalities and cohabiting with spouses who engage in financial misconduct are also associated with a higher likelihood of executive misconduct, indicating that such behaviors may be shaped by broader socialization processes that extend beyond the immediate family. Although our analyses do not establish causal relationships, the collective evidence presented in this study offers insights into why some corporate executives engage in misconduct while others do not.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on research on social class origin and cognitive concepts from the psychology literature, we propose that social class environment during childhood creates class-based cognitive imprints among individuals, leading to contextualist cognitive tendencies among lower-class individuals and solipsistic cognitive tendencies among upper-class individuals. We theorize that these class-based cognitive tendencies explain the prosocial behavior of individuals, such that the philanthropic orientation is greater among entrepreneurs of lower-class origin compared with those of upper-class origin. The philanthropic orientation among lower-class entrepreneurs is further amplified by imprints of education and political propaganda. These theoretical predictions received support considering entrepreneurs in Chinese private enterprises. Our study contributes to the literature on the social class origin concept from the social stratification theory, the psychology literature on cognitive perspectives, and imprinting theory.</content>

    <title>Is Blending Fintech With Traditional Finance a Top-Shelf Blend or a Sour Mix? Evidence From the Ownership of Equity Crowdfunding Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital finance platforms are disrupting traditional financial entities (FEs). Yet, FEs increasingly invest in their ownership. We investigate whether FE ownership creates a “top-shelf blend” that enhances platform performance or a “sour mix” that undermines it. We integrate legitimacy theory and organizational identity theory to theorize an invertedU-shaped relationship between FE ownership and the performance of equity crowdfunding (ECF) platforms. A longitudinal analysis based on 306 ECF platforms demonstrates that FE ownership enhances performance up to a certain point, after which performance declines. The legitimacy of FEs owning ECF platforms moderates this relationship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent expansion in the availability of longitudinal and granular panel data has led to a significant increase in the adoption of dynamic panel data (DPD) models in empirical Operations Management (OM) research. To explore this trend, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of empirical OM studies published from 2012 to 2024 in four leading OM journals. Our findings reveal a marked rise in the utilization of DPD models in recent years, with 49 out of 66 (74.2%) reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024. Despite this growing adoption, the estimation of DPD models presents notable methodological challenges compared to standard panel fixed‐effects models, creating barriers to their wider use in empirical OM research. Our simulation shows that the widely used least‐squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator can be significantly biased when estimating DPD models. Variations in methodological choices can lead to differing results and conclusions, raising concerns about the rigor of current practices. To address these issues, we provide a technical review of recent estimation methods for DPD models, highlighting their underlying assumptions and initial conditions. Among these, we recommend the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for its flexibility and less restrictive assumptions, which have contributed to its popularity across various research fields. However, the application of GMM requires a careful, iterative process, which many OM researchers may not be familiar with. To support the effective use of GMM in DPD models in empirical OM research, we propose a practical framework that guides researchers through this process and demonstrates its practical use through real‐world data from supply base management. This framework aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy of estimating DPD models, facilitating more robust empirical research in the field of OM.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: AdGazer: Improving Contextual Advertising with Theory-Informed Machine Learning</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contextual advertising involves matching features of ads to features of the media context where they appear. We propose AdGazer, a new machine learning procedure to support contextual advertising. It comprises a theoretical framework organizing highand low-level features of ads and contexts, feature engineering models grounded in this framework, an XGBoost model predicting ad and brand attention, and an algorithm optimally assigning ads to contexts. AdGazer includes a Multimodal Large Language Model to extract high-level topics predicting the ad-context match. Our research uses a unique eye-tracking database containing 3531 digital display ads and their contexts, and aggregate ad and brand gaze times. We compare AdGazer’s predictive performance to two feature learning models, VGG16 and ResNet50. AdGazer predicts highly accurately with hold-out correlations of 0.83 for ad gaze and 0.80 for brand gaze, outperforming both feature learning models and generalizing better to out-of-distribution ads. Context features jointly contributed at least 33% to predicted ad gaze and about 20% to predicted brand gaze, good news for managers practicing or considering contextual advertising. We demonstrate that the theory-informed AdGazer effectively matches ads to advertising vehicles and their contexts, optimizing ad gaze more than current practice and alternatives like text-based and native contextual advertising.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research theorizespostliminal self‐transformation, the process by which consumers adapt to new status positions following major life transitions. Prior consumer research emphasizes liminality—the “betwixt and between” ambiguous phase— but overlooks what happens after liminality as individuals attempt to fit in. Drawing on qualitative data regarding young Indian women migrants to metropolitan corporate contexts, we reveal that transformation does not end with liminality but unfolds through a reflexive and effortful postliminal process. Women strategically use consumption—particularly of clothing and accessories—to bridge self‐discrepancies, mitigate exclusion, and gradually internalize their new professional identities. This stagewise progression moves from observation and mimicry to embodied transformation and identity mastery, often under constraints of patriarchy, class, and gender expectations. Contrasting with traditional (Western) models of adulthood that emphasize settling down, the women's postliminal adaptation is emancipatory and nonlinear, updating scripts for marking adulthood. By theorizing this postliminal adaptation, we challenge assumptions of instantaneous reincorporation, extending understanding of identity work. Our framework advances consumer psychology by showing how consumption facilitates ongoing self‐reconstruction in dynamic and inequitable social hierarchies.</content>

    <title>Reporting Regulation and Private Firms' Bank Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effect of reporting regulation on private firms' bank credit and its economic consequences. I exploit the Spanish institutional setting, which provides a unique combination of confidential loan data and regulatory features that generate quasi‐exogenous variation in reporting regulation. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that firms subject to incremental reporting regulation obtain more bank credit primarily through cash flow–based lending, term loans, and long‐term debt, without higher interest rates. These findings are explained by stronger banking competition and greater reliance on financial statement data. However, firms do not expand their net financial position, as bank credit substitutes for other liabilities, and exhibit weaker performance consistent with the costs of reporting regulation. This evidence from a different setting offers new insights into how reporting regulation influences credit contracting for private firms and strengthens the empirical basis for policy‐making.</content>

    <title>When should firms watch for cross‐industry competition? A demand‐side perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on competitor identification has primarily focused on intra‐industry competition. However, cross‐industry competitive threats are prevalent and consequential. We adopt a consumer‐oriented perspective to examine how consumer perceptions shape de facto competition across industry boundaries. Drawing from social cognition theories, we introduce two mechanisms—cultural embeddedness and social salience—that lead consumers to perceive products in an emerging industry as viable substitutes for those in an established industry, thereby intensifying competitive pressures on established firms. We further hypothesize that the impact of these mechanisms varies across heterogeneous customer groups, specifically with respect to income, education, and immigration status. Event history analyses of Illinois movie theater failures during television's rise in 1944–1962 support our theorizing.Managerial SummaryIdentifying competitors can be a complex managerial task. While it often suffices to monitor only within‐industry competitors, unexpected cross‐industry rivals selling seemingly different products can create competitive blind spots. To identify cross‐industry competitive threats, we propose a demand‐based view to complement managerial perceptions: Do your customers view your offerings as interchangeable with emerging products? We find that when an emerging industry's products embody cultural elements borrowed from the established industry's offerings or resonate better with public discourse, customers are likely to perceive substitutability and switch to the emerging products. However, this tendency varies among customers with different profiles, making it essential to recognize which customer segments are more vulnerable when facing cross‐industry competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We derive wage equations with individual specific coefficients from a structural model of human capital investment over the life cycle. This model allows for interruptions in labour market participation and deals with missing data and attrition problems. We propose a new framework that deals with missingness at random and is based on factor decompositions that allow for flexible control of selection. Our approach leads to an interactive effect wage specification, which we estimate using long administrative panel data on male wages in the private sector in France. A structural function approach shows that interruptions negatively affect average wages. Interestingly, they also negatively affect the inter-decile range of wages after twenty years. This is only partly due to the fact that interruptions are endogenous.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Subscription sharing, where users share premium family plans with non-family members via platforms like TogetherPrice and Sharesub, has become increasingly common. This raises a key question: should providers still offer discounted family plans alongside individual ones? Our research explores this issue for a monopolistic provider facing this sharing threat. We analyze the optimal pricing strategy and the effects of subscription sharing on profits, plan offerings, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that offering both plans is at least as profitable as offering individual plans only, and sharing can sometimes supercharge profits. However, platform fees reduce these benefits by narrowing the price gap between plans, weakening the market expansion effect. Our numerical results show that sharing often improves social welfare. Overall, these insights suggest that subscription sharing is not always as harmful to providers, and the platform service fees play a key role in pricing strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand platforms like ride-sharing services rely heavily on economic incentives to attract, retain, and manage independent workers who have significant discretion over whether and where to work. Using an analytically tractable spatial model, we explore the impact of different pricing and commission strategies on customer demand, driver entry and retention, and their location choices. Our model yields several unique results and actionable insights. We find that flexible commission policies are more effective than fixed commission policies in allocating drivers efficiently across locations, reducing bottlenecks, and improving driver retention. We also show that commission-based interventions are more effective than price interventions in responding to labor market changes, as they directly affect driver incentives without distorting customer demand. Finally, if fairness-sensitive customers are prevalent in the market, then fixed pricing, combined with flexible commissions, becomes the optimal rule. Simulations based on actual ride patterns from New York City and Los Angeles confirm our insights.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Product Sharing: A Threat or an Opportunity for Competing Manufacturers?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of product sharing on competing manufacturers under a platform's different quality entry barrier strategies. We build a game-theoretic analytical model to examine the strategies of two manufacturers: a high-quality manufacturer producing a high-quality product and a low-quality manufacturer producing a low-quality product. We explore three markets: the N-S market where the sharing market does not exist, the L-S market, and the H-S market, where the platform sets low and high entry barriers, respectively. We study these three markets because they bracket the most common platform entry policies in practice—no sharing, low-barrier (open access), and high-barrier (quality-gated) participation. Our findings indicate that while product sharing makes it easier for the high-quality manufacturer to survive, it may not necessarily improve the survival likelihood of the low-quality manufacturer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of the sharing market may negatively impact both manufacturers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate how competing manufacturers, platforms, and consumers can cope with the sharing phenomenon. We show that, while the high-quality manufacturer prefers a low cost of quality in all three markets, the low-quality manufacturer, interestingly, prefers a high cost of quality in both product-sharing markets. Additionally, we illustrate that the platform should not always set a low entry barrier to allow more product types to join. Surprisingly, our results show that although product sharing always benefits social welfare, it could potentially harm consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing prominence of live streaming has attracted the attention from both e-commerce practitioners and the research community. This paper investigates the impact of online retailers adopting live streaming technology in business operations on their product sales, dissecting dual roles of live streaming: information provision and customer relationship management. Leveraging multiple archival data sources, we combine econometrics with deep learning to analyze the nuanced, dual roles of live streaming in online retail. Specifically, we develop a novel deep learning framework to identify two types of live streaming strategies, product-oriented and non-product-oriented, and find that both strategies significantly increase online product sales. Notably, our research suggests that past review volume and product visual informativeness substitute the impact of using product-oriented live streaming; whereas seller’s rating and product visual informativeness complement the impact of using non-product-oriented live streaming. These results suggest that product-oriented live streaming increases sales by reducing product uncertainty via information provision, whereas non-product-oriented live streaming increases sales via non-information mechanisms, such as enhancing customer relationship management.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Using AI as Gatekeeper or Second Opinion: Designing Patient Pathways for AI-Augmented Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Of the 1,247 artificial intelligence (AI) systems cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as of May 2025, most function as classifiers to help screen or diagnose specific medical conditions. Yet, questions remain about how to best integrate AI into healthcare workflows, including whether AI should serve as a gatekeeper, determining which patients require human attention, or as a second opinion to complement medical consultations. Motivated by this question, we model a healthcare system in which patients can consult a specialist, an AI system, or both. The key design question is whether the patient should first consult AI or the specialist, corresponding to AI’s gatekeeper and second-opinion roles, respectively. We model a two-step decision-making process influenced by an initial signal, or anchor. Contrary to popular belief, we show using AI as a gatekeeper does not necessarily increase missed diagnoses; using AI as a second opinion, on the other hand, reduces missed diagnoses but can also increase false positives. In general, the gatekeeper approach is preferable in low-risk settings, whereas the second-opinion approach is better suited for high-risk patients for whom avoiding missed diagnoses is a primary concern. Notably, scenarios exists where AI shouldnotbe used for intermediate-risk patients for whom uncertainty is highest, challenging the premise that AI is most useful in reducing uncertainty. Finally, applying our model to glaucoma diagnosis, we numerically illustrate cost savings from optimizing patient pathways. Our work highlights the potential for AI to contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by optimizing resource allocation and improving patient outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employing unique data from 91 stocks trading on their primary exchanges and three alternative venues, we show that liquidity suppliers post duplicate limit orders on competing trading venues and cancel the duplicated orders immediately after one of them is filled. This is consistent with liquidity suppliers engaging in crossvenue market making. This duplicated-then-canceled liquidity is predominantly used by high-frequency traders when their inventories are not excessive. It reduces execution costs of fast traders on alternative venues. It, however, has some adverse impact on execution costs on primary exchanges, but those negative effects fail to outweigh the liquidity benefits of market fragmentation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grant ANR-15-CE33-0006] for funding the project and Centre pour la recherche économique et ses applications for granting additional research budget.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01789 .</content>

    <title>Platform Disintermediation with Repeated Transactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a setting in which a platform matches buyers and sellers, who then wish to transact with each other multiple times. The platform charges fees for hosting transactions but also offers convenience benefits. We consider two scenarios. In one scenario, all transactions must occur on the platform; in the other scenario, buyers and sellers can disintermediate the platform after the first transaction and do subsequent transactions offline. We find that the platform reacts to disintermediation by using a “front-loaded” pricing scheme, whereby it charges more for earlier transactions. We also show that sometimes the platform is better off when disintermediation is possible—because it can use disintermediation to screen users’ private information about their convenience benefits. Buyers are not necessarily better off when they can disintermediate due to the way in which the platform adjusts its fees.This paper was accepted by Greg Shaffer, marketing.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the most notable developments of the sharing economy is the unfettered proliferation of on-demand services. In this work, we examine how a subset of such platforms, online food delivery (e.g., Grubhub, UberEats, DoorDash), has affected the meal preparation and dining behaviors of American households. To do so, we exploit the phased entry of the platform Grubhub into U.S. counties from 2005 to 2019 using a difference-in-difference approach. Results indicate that the availability of such delivery services leads to a significant reduction in time spent preparing meals within the home, with no concomitant change in dining out. This effect is intensified in areas subject to greater demand and in areas with a greater number of restaurants but abates when less economically feasible (i.e., in areas with higher unemployment and households with more children). We also explore the association of Grubhub availability with subsequent changes in population body mass index. Implications for research, consumers, platforms, and public health are discussed.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02636 .</content>

    <title>Constructing New Product Development Portfolios with Internal and External Projects</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In order to build a successful new product development (NPD) portfolio, a firm must ensure not only its access to a wide variety of candidate NPD projects but also its capacity to collect and verify vital information about these projects prior to project selection. In practice, a popular strategy to enrich the set of candidate projects is to contemplate investing in both internal and external NPD projects; however, this approach often interferes with the firm’s ability to evaluate its own projects reliably, which in turn results in subpar project selections. To meet this managerial challenge, the firm must carefully craft its project selection process and incentivize its project managers to evaluate projects thoroughly and share their honest evaluation of outcomes. We address these issues by developing a principal–multiagent model, and our findings yield direct managerial implications. First, we show that the relative importance of a firm’s NPD portfolio scope versus its project evaluation costs is what dictates how flexibly the firm should select between internal and external projects; of course, greater flexibility leads to broader portfolios but also to higher evaluation costs. Second, controlling the tension between internal and external NPD projects while ensuring effective project evaluation requires that the firm offers—in addition to individual performance incentives—shared incentives, which signal its project selection preferences and also limit project managers’ opportunities to extract rent.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03917 .</content>

    <title>Measurement for Dummies? Exploring the Role of Regulatory Metrics and Firm Strategy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most regulations are operationalized through metrics: numerical thresholds, targets, or test procedures that translate broad policy objectives into enforceable rules. Yet we know little about how these metrics shape firms’ strategic behavior. This paper aims to fill this gap by studying the introduction of the side impact dummy (SID) in U.S. automotive regulation, which established a regulatory metric based on the average male-sized body. Using detailed data on U.S. vehicular accidents, I find that the regulation led to large reductions in side-impact fatalities, but there were disproportionate benefits for occupants whose body sizes resembled SID. Furthermore this pattern is driven by heterogeneous firm behavior: Some firms delivered safety improvements across all occupants, whereas others focused narrowly on meeting the metric. This was moderated by two factors: firms’ strategic alignment with safety and their metric-based capabilities. Only firms with both dimensions were able to make broad improvements in line with policy objectives. These findings underscore the powerful role of regulatory metrics in channeling firm attention and effort. The ultimate impact of a regulation therefore depends not only on what policymakers measure but also which firms have the motivation and capabilities to act on them in a broad policy-consistent way.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01987 .</content>

    <title>Rational Choice Models: The Temporal Tree Representation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Choice models, which specify the consumers’ choice probabilities of options over a given choice set, are widely studied and applied in many fields. We propose a temporal tree representation of choice that covers all rational choice models. Compared with existing structural choice models, the tree representation exhibits two major advantages that address the key challenges of model identification. First, all rational choice models have a tree representation, and a subclass of tree representation (with set-dependent branching) has a one-to-one correspondence with the rational choice models. This bridges the gap in the existing characterizations of structural models, which are unidentifiable, impose uninterpretable conditions, or do not cover the entire space of rational choice models. Second, the tree representation allows for the flexibility of systematically specifying the choice model structure based on available knowledge and data. In particular, the number of parameters needed to specify a tree representation can be primarily determined by the sufficient knowledge level, which corresponds to a specific layer of the tree branching. The sufficient knowledge level can be empirically determined based on the amount of available data, which, in turn, determines the number of parameters needed for model estimation. Therefore, the tree representation allows for a natural way of data integration, avoiding misspecification from restrictive assumptions and overfitting for general models.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Assembling novel data sets on online advertiser spending, performance, and revenue, we quantify the economic effects of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy on e-commerce firms. We find that conversion-optimized Meta advertisements, affected most by ATT, saw a 37% reduction in click-through rates after ATT. Although firms responded by shifting ad spending from Meta to the Google ecosystem, firms with higher baseline Meta dependence nevertheless experienced a substantial decline in firm-wide revenue relative to firms with lower baseline Meta dependence. We quantify these effects using a variety of methods, finding revenue decreases in the range between 8% and 40% relative to less exposed firms. These declines were primarily borne by smaller e-commerce firms, raising questions about the tradeoffs between consumer privacy and the ability of smaller e-commerce and direct-to-consumer firms to succeed in the product market.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the LEC Program on Economics &amp; Privacy, MSI Research Grant [4001820].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06600 .</content>

    <title>Once a Conformist, Always a Conformist? Firms’ Discontinued Conformity to Global Sustainability Standards</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although scholars have established the importance of conformity to institutional pressures, limited research has examined the phenomenon of discontinued conformity, that is, when some firms withdraw from institutionalized practice after initial conformity. We propose that institutional immunity is a key mechanism by which firms enact such changes in response to institutional pressures. We identify ownership as the internal source of institutional immunity and interactions with external groups as the external sources. Institutional immunity filters institutional pressures and enables firms to withdraw after initial conformity. Using an event history analysis with 19,438 global observations concerning an institutionalized sustainability practice from 2012 to 2017, we find support for the proposed relationship between institutional immunity and discontinued conformity as well as the boundary condition of institutional quality. This study highlights organizational change away from conformity owing to the persistence of institutional contradictions and enriches our understanding of institutional immunity.</content>

    <title>The Asymmetry of Gender-Fluid Trends</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers and consumers are rapidly embracing gender-fluid products that fundamentally challenge the conventional associations of masculinity and femininity. In theory, manifestations of gender fluidity in the marketplace respond to shifting gender norms toward more inclusivity. Accordingly, consumers believe that the representation of traditionally male and female styles in these trends should be even. In contrast with these balanced views, this research demonstrates that gender-fluid trends to date skew toward traditionally male styles and that the corresponding adoption of gender-fluid products is driven relatively more by female and nonbinary consumers. Using a multimethod approach (including trend analyses of over 100,000 baby names, deep learning on a dataset of 200,000 products, and a series of experiments), this research defines gender fluidity in marketing, distinguishes it from related constructs such as gender-bending, unisex, and androgyny, and reveals a skewness in gender-fluid trends to date. It further demonstrates that women’s and nonbinary individuals’ heightened awareness of male advantages in society and lower fear of negative evaluation drive their greater adoption of gender-fluid styles.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We recover forward-looking expected net-of-fee abnormal returns (alphas) for active equity mutual funds from analyst ratings. In contrast to the typical equilibrium implication of zero alphas, analyst alphas are negative for most funds, but positive for the largest funds. We compare analysts’ subjective expectations with expectations from a rational expectations learning model. The model’s rational learner believes that an increase in fund size leads to a decrease in returns, but we find no evidence that analysts believe so. Consistently, counterfactual ratings based on the rational model tend to outperform analysts’ ratings out of sample. Investor fund flows respond significantly to analyst ratings.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Support from the Center for Big Data in Finance [Grant DNRF167], the Danish Finance Institute, and the Swedish House of Finance is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Can Employees’ Past Helping Behavior Be Used to Improve Shift Scheduling? Evidence from ICU Nurses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees routinely make valuable contributions at work that are not part of their formal job description, such as helping a struggling coworker. These contributions, termed organizational citizenship behavior, are studied from many angles in the organizational behavior literature. However, the degree to which the past helping behavior of employees scheduled to a shift impacts that shift’s operational outcomes remains an underexplored question. We define two measures of past helping behavior for members of a shift—the total past helping of each employee and the past helping between each pair of employees—and hypothesize that they are associated with shift performance. We empirically confirm our hypotheses with detailed scheduling and patient outcome data from six intensive care units (ICUs) at a large academic medical center, using the hospital’s electronic medical records to identify cases of one nurse helping another. Our empirical results indicate that both measures of past helping are predictive of patient length of stay (LOS), more so than the broadly studied notion of team familiarity. Counterfactual analysis shows that relatively small changes in shift composition can yield significant reduction in total LOS, indicating the managerial significance of the results. Overall, our study suggests the potential value of shift scheduling using data on past helping behaviors, and this may have promise far beyond the selected application to ICU nursing.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00465 .</content>

    <title>Inventing with Machines: Generative AI and the Evolving Landscape of IS Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not merely changing how information systems (IS) research gets done—it is reshaping what research can be. We stand at a pivotal moment where machines can help generate hypotheses, synthesize vast literatures, and identify patterns that would take human researchers months to uncover. Yet, this unprecedented capability presents equally unprecedented risks to scholarly integrity. Because the field is uniquely positioned to understand sociotechnical transformations, IS research faces an extraordinary opportunity to pioneer “inventing with machines” while preserving the human insight and oversight that gives scholarship, as currently defined, its meaning. This transformation demands more than tool adoption. It requires a reimagination of scholarly infrastructure, norms, and practice. However, this transformation of research tooling creates a dangerous paradox: Powerful AI tools are now accessible to researchers who lack the technical literacy to understand and use them responsibly, threatening everything from citation accuracy to theoretical validity. Yet within this paradox lies the potential for revolutionary advances in how we craft our future as scholars. Informed by the sociotechnical perspective, we argue that the path forward requires coordinated community action that goes far beyond individual skill development. The IS community must lead the development of specialized AI tools that consider our theoretical traditions, create educational frameworks that preserve scholarly values while embracing computational capabilities, and pioneer review processes that harness AI’s analytical power without ceding human control, at least, in the short run. Success will determine not only the future of IS scholarship but our field’s capacity to guide other disciplines through this fundamental transformation of academic practice. The era of human-AI collaboration in research has already begun. How we govern and guide it will define the next generation of scholarly discovery.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence, CEO Turnover, and Exploration Orientation in Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leadership transitions often create uncertainty in corporate innovation. Our study shows that artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in helping firms navigate these transitions. Using data on patents, job postings, and CEO turnover across U.S. public firms, we find that organizations with stronger AI investment are more successful in pursuing explorative innovation after CEO turnover. AI enables this shift by helping leaders overcome two common barriers: managerial myopia, the tendency to rely on familiar past practices, and information overload, which can overwhelm new executives. Firms that leverage AI more effectively reallocate resources to research and development, elevate innovation as a strategic priority, and launch new initiatives. These effects are especially pronounced in manufacturing industries and when CEOs have science, technology, engineering, and mathematics backgrounds. For practice, our findings highlight AI as a strategic capability that helps firms sustain organizational creativity during leadership change. For policy, they suggest that promoting AI adoption could strengthen innovation dynamism and competitiveness in rapidly changing environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The aging workforce demands evidence‐based human resource practices that lengthen working lives. Building on the Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll 1989), we investigate which organizational practices are indispensable for expanding older workers' occupational future time perspective (OFTP)—people's perceived opportunities and remaining time at work (Zacher and Frese 2009). A necessary condition analysis of survey data from 3077 workers aged 50+ in nine countries tests nine domains of the Later Life Workplace Index (LLWI) as potentialminimal viable practices. All domains exhibited statistically significant necessity effects; however, using the conventional threshold (Dul et al. 2023), only later life supportive leadership and adaptive work design reached the level consideredmeaningfully necessary. The remaining domains showed smaller, near necessity effects, suggesting a pattern of partial necessity across HRM practices. Exploratory analyses along the Tightness–Looseness cultural continuum suggested that necessity thresholds tended to be higher in culturally Tight than Loose societies, highlighting the importance of context‐sensitive HRM. This study refines theorizing on career sustainability, introduces necessity logic to the work and aging literature, and offers managers evidence‐based tools to prevent insurmountable shortcomings. Failure to meet the identified LLWI thresholds will typically result in suboptimal OFTP.</content>

    <title>From critique to catalyst: How academic entrepreneurs transform negative feedback into pivots and performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how academic entrepreneurs refine business ideas in response to external critique and how these responses relate to performance. We develop a framework that links feedback (critique), business‐idea changes (pivots), and performance, and test it using detailed data on external stakeholder feedback, changes to the business idea's core and periphery, and commercialization outcomes in 316 academic‐led teams. We find that academic entrepreneurs frequently modify their business idea's core in response to negative feedback, and that core changes—rather than peripheral ones—are positively associated with commercialization. Challenging the idea that all entrepreneurs are inertial, we find that academic entrepreneurs both actively embrace and benefit from changes to the business idea's core. By tracing the feedback‐response dynamics of business idea components, our study adds granularity to research on pivoting.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs often face a choice between reworking the core of a business idea and making changes to its periphery. Analyzing 316 academic‐led teams seeking to commercialize technologies using the Lean Startup Method, we find that academic‐led teams frequently change their idea's core in response to negative feedback—and that only core changes, rather than peripheral changes, are linked to improved commercialization outcomes. Overall, the results show the effectiveness of the Lean Startup Method and demonstrate that focusing feedback on the core of the business idea is an effective way to provide feedback to academic entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The difference between corporate bond yields at issuance and in secondary markets, the “issuance premium,” spikes in bad times, raising firms’ capital costs. Using new bond-level data and high-frequency variation in bond supply and demand, I estimate a model of primary markets with imperfectly elastic investors, endogenous bond supply, and underwriter frictions that quantifies drivers of issuance premiums. I find underwriters’ favoritism toward investors increases issuance premiums’ levels and cyclical variation. On the other hand, relatively elastic investors allow primary markets to absorb large bond issuances. My findings inform policies targeted at bond issuance markets. (JEL G23, E44, G32, E52)</content>

    <title>Balancing Power in Decentralized Governance: Quadratic Voting and Information Aggregation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In decentralized governance, quadratic voting (QV)—where the cost of acquiring voting power is convex—optimally aggregates voter preferences, outperforming simpler linear voting (LV) mechanisms when voters have complete information. But what if they do not? We show that uncertainty not only breaks QV optimality but can also cause it to underperform LV. Intuitively, this is because cost convexity can disincentivize better-informed voters from adequately conveying their private information. The optimal mechanism varies with the distribution of stakes and information among voters, implying that QV’s known advantages in preference aggregation do not readily extend to common-value information aggregation settings.This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on the Digital Finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08469 .</content>

    <title>Deep Neural Newsvendor</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a data-driven newsvendor problem, where one has access to past demand data and the associated feature information. We solve the problem by estimating the target conditional quantile function using a deep neural network (DNN). The remarkable representational power of DNNs allows our framework to incorporate or approximate various extant data-driven models. We provide theoretical guarantees in terms of excess risk bounds for the DNN solution characterized by the network structure and sample size in a nonasymptotic manner, which justify the applicability of DNNs in relevant contexts. Specifically, the convergence rate of the excess risk bound with respect to the sample size increases in the smoothness of the target quantile function but decreases in the dimension of feature variables. This rate can be further accelerated when the target function possesses a composite structure. In particular, our theoretical framework can be extended to accommodate data-dependent scenarios, where the data-generating process could be time-dependent but not necessarily identical over time. Building on our theoretical results, we provide further managerial insights and practical guidance through simulation studies. Finally, we apply the DNN method to a real-world data set obtained from a food supermarket. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that (1) the DNN method consistently outperforms alternatives across a wide range of cost parameters, and (2) it exhibits good performance when the sample size is either very large or relatively limited.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2021-04295]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Project: Data-Driven Operations Analytics Methods]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Peking University; the General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grant 15305523]; and the Research Fund of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [Grant P0048718].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03157 .</content>

    <title>Social Media Sponsorship: Metrics and Strategies for Finding the Right Content Creator-Sponsor Matches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media video sponsorship, where sponsors partner with content creators to promote their brands, has become increasingly popular. Leveraging rich data on sponsored and nonsponsored videos on Facebook, we introduce two metrics, Content Similarity and Audience Closeness, to help sponsors find effective creator-sponsor matches. Content Similarity captures the thematic alignment between a creator’s content and a sponsor’s brand, whereas Audience Closeness measures how closely aligned a creator’s and sponsor’s audiences are within a social media network. We find that both metrics significantly increase video viewership, but their effects vary over time. Audience Closeness generates more immediate, short-term engagement, whereas Content Similarity drives sustained, long-term engagement. We additionally examine how congruency metrics can complement other sponsorship strategies, including partnering with more established creators, forming new partnerships, and managing the sponsor’s visibility within content. Our findings suggest that Content Similarity can mitigate the negative effects of frequent sponsor appearances and enhance viewer engagement, even in repetitive partnerships. Moreover, we find that Audience Closeness is particularly beneficial for larger, more established creators, whereas Content Similarity is less sensitive to the size of a creator’s following. Finally, we demonstrate how intermediary platforms can adopt these metrics to reduce information asymmetry and improve creator-sponsor matching, especially for long-tail creators and smaller brands.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01192 .</content>

    <title>Systematic Mispricing of Speculative Stocks and the Cross-Sectional Risk-Return Trade-off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the cross-section of returns from the perspective of a benchmark model that only includes systematic mispricing factors. In contrast to conclusions from standard benchmark models, we recover robust positive risk-return relations for many cross-sectional risk, distress, and friction proxies. Our findings are consistent with systematic mispricing that primarily affects speculative stocks and predominantly results in overpricing, predicting lower returns. Hence, failing to control for exposure to systematic mispricing can bias tests of risk-return trade-offs for anomalies with one speculative leg (e.g., risky, distressed, or high-friction stocks) and one nonspeculative leg. Overall, our study offers novel economic insight for this subset of anomalies, indicating that a positive risk-return trade-off can be resurrected after purging out the systematic mispricing component. The evidence suggests that a small shift in perspective generates a substantially different interpretation of the same data.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08815 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the evolution to a multipolar economic world during the past three decades, management and organization scholars around the world still largely employ a capitalist view from the United States as the normal state, with scholars analysing other economic contexts as some variation of such capitalism. Despite the fact that over 43 percent of the world’s population lives in nations whose constitutions say the nation is socialist, management and organization scholars appear frozen in time, tied to a historical period when there was largely only one dominant economic model. OurPointis that when communities (nations or individual groups) pursue other economic forms, scholars need to consider that contextual setting, including the socialism, rather than simply assume a typical United States capitalist context as the foundation for research. We identify, define, and illustrate four varieties of socialism in thisPoint. In turn, we then demonstrate how scholars’ understanding of the specific domain of entrepreneurship can be enriched if the socialism of the given context is addressed rather than capitalism assumed. Management and organization scholarship around the world should, moving forward, reflect the dynamics of each unique context, including the respective economic system in that given context, rather than continue to reinforce a United States epistemological hegemony.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Neurodiversity—an umbrella term encompassing a range of neurocognitive developmental conditions such as autism‐spectrum conditions, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, and Tourette syndrome)—recognizes neurological differences as natural variations of the human brain. As management scholars increasingly explore this dimension of diversity, both researchers and practitioners are gaining a deeper understanding of the valuable contributions neurodivergent human capital can bring to the modern workplace. In this article, which serves as a primer for the special issue on neurodiversity and human resource management (HRM), we present a systematic review of the neurodiversity literature organized by employee lifecycle stage. The review synthesizes the most comprehensive practices at the intersection of neurodiversity and HRM. We then introduce the 13 articles featured in the special issue by positioning them within broader trends that emerged from our review. Moreover, we show how each article advances scholarship and practice in neurodiversity and HRM. We conclude by drawing on insights from both the review and the special issue contributions to offer recommendations for future research and practice that center on fostering more inclusive and effective HRM systems for neurodivergent individuals.</content>

    <title>Launch support: Managing complementor bottlenecks in the disruptive innovation of small satellites</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of large‐rocket providers' support for small‐satellite manufacturers before the emergence of small rockets, we examine how disruptors to an incumbent ecosystem gain support from complementors of the incumbent technology. Our analyses illuminate the incumbent complementors' adjustment costs arising from cospecialization with specific incumbent technology designs and resource dependency on major incumbent technology customers. These adjustment costs disincentivize incumbent complementors from supporting the disruptors. In addition, we demonstrate that strategies adopted by the disruptors, such as technological standardization and forward integration, help mitigate these adjustment costs and incentivize incumbent complementors to support the disruptive innovation.Managerial SummarySmall satellites represent a disruptive innovation that significantly reduces the time and cost of satellite production and launch. Despite the large number of small satellites launched today, initially, they were viewed as “second‐class launch citizens,” with incumbent large‐rocket companies resisting launching them. This paper examines how small‐satellite manufacturers overcame this resistance before their dedicated small‐satellite ecosystem was established. We identify the adjustment costs that caused resistance from large‐rocket companies and examine two specific strategies implemented by disruptors—technological standardization and forward integration—to mitigate these costs and gain support from large‐rocket companies.</content>

    <title>Performance feedback and change in R&amp;amp;D alliance portfolio breadth: The moderating role of economic conditions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how firm performance feedback and economic conditions (upturns and downturns) impact changes in the breadth of partner types within a firm's R&amp;D alliance portfolio (R&amp;D AP breadth). We theorize that economic conditions moderate firms' motivation to change R&amp;D AP breadth in response to social and historical performance‐aspiration discrepancies, and shape whether they respond more strongly to social or historical aspirations. Using cross‐industry data on Swiss firms (1999–2020), we find that firms performing below social aspiration are more likely to expand R&amp;D AP breadth during downturns but less likely to do so during upturns. Performance below historical aspiration shows no significant effect once economic conditions are considered.Managerial SummaryWe examine how firms adjust their range of business partners in response to past performance and economic conditions. Analyzing Swiss firms from 1999 to 2020, we find that firms strategically adjust the number of partnership types in response to economic climates. During tough economic times, firms tend to broaden their R&amp;D partnership types when they fall short of peer performance benchmarks. They tend not to do so in prosperous periods under similar performance conditions. We found no consistent effects when performance is benchmarked against the firm's history. These insights help managers strategically navigate alliances under fluctuating economic conditions and underscore the importance of peer‐relative performance benchmarks.</content>

    <title>Permanent Capital Losses After Banking Crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the mechanisms driving bank losses across historical banking crises in 46 economies and the effectiveness of policy interventions in restoring bank capitalization. We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations. Early liquidity interventions can avert banking crises, but only under specific conditions. Once large bank equity declines have occurred, policy responses have historically failed to prevent persistent undercapitalization in the banking sector.</content>

    <title>Republican Support and Economic Hardship: The Enduring Effects Of the Opioid Epidemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we establish a causal connection between two of the most salient social developments in the United States over the past decades: the opioid epidemic and the political realignment between the Republican and Democratic parties. Drawing on unsealed records from litigation against Purdue Pharma, we uncover rich geographic variation in the marketing of prescription opioids that serves as a quasi-exogenous source of exposure to the epidemic. We use this variation to document significant increases in drug-related mortality and greater reliance on public transfer programs. This induced economic hardship led to substantial changes in the political landscape of the communities most affected by the opioid epidemic. We estimate that from the mid-2000s to 2022, exposure to the opioid epidemic continuously increased the Republican vote share in House, presidential, and gubernatorial elections. By the 2022 House elections, a one-standard-deviation increase in our measure of exposure led to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the Republican vote share. From 2012 until 2022, this increase in the House vote share translated into Republicans winning additional seats.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: PRODUCT RECALL CONTAGION in the SUPPLY CHAIN</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Following a manufacturer’s large product recall, its supplier’s shareholders may perceive uncertain future demand for the supplier’s products and react punitively, causing a drop in the supplier’s stock return—i.e., a contagion (or negative spillover). Moreover, shareholders’ information asymmetry may cause them to “screen” the supplier’s information cues to determine the supplier’s extent of demand uncertainty. The ideal screen is the supplier’s proportion of sales revenue from the recalling manufacturer. However, not all suppliers disclose this information. Therefore, we propose that shareholders use a two-stage screening. The first screen is whether the supplier demonstrates transparency by voluntarily disclosing information about its customer portfolio. The second screen—available only to the subset of suppliers that disclose customer information—is the supplier’s sales revenue from the recalling manufacturer. We used a sample of 896 U.S. public manufacturer-supplier dyads impacted by 27 large manufacturer recalls. An event study followed by cross-sectional regressions provides evidence of contagion. In addition, it reveals that the supplier’s voluntary disclosure of customer information mitigates contagion, whereas revenue dependence aggravates it. Contextual (i.e., recall) variables also impact contagion. Our research study contributes to the supply-chain contagion literature, screening theory, and customer information disclosure literature. The findings inform supplier firm managers that their prior customer-related disclosures and the contextual variables can moderate contagion.</content>

    <title>Adaptive Learning in Uncertain and Sequential Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In competitive markets, companies often lack access to their rivals’ sales, costs, and strategies. Can they still learn to make optimal decisions? In a new study, Li and Mehrotra show that the answer is yes. Their research demonstrates that even without competitor data, firms can adaptively learn to make near-optimal choices using only their own operational information. More strikingly, when all players follow such self-driven learning, the entire market converges to a Nash equilibrium—the stable state predicted by economic theory—without explicit coordination. The study establishes theoretical guarantees for both convergence rates and regret performance and illustrates the framework in inventory management and dynamic pricing settings. These findings provide a foundation for data-driven decision making in competitive and uncertain environments and offer insights into how markets naturally self-organize.</content>

    <title>On Generalization and Regularization via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
    <updated>2025-11-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has gained prominence in operations research and machine learning as a powerful method for achieving solutions with favorable out-of-sample performance. Two compelling explanations for its success are the generalization bounds derived from Wasserstein DRO and its equivalence to regularization schemes commonly used in machine learning. However, existing results on generalization bounds and regularization equivalence are largely limited to settings where the Wasserstein ball is of a specific type, and the decision criterion takes certain forms of expected functions. In this paper, we show that generalization bounds and regularization equivalence can be obtained in a significantly broader setting, where the Wasserstein ball is of a general type and the decision criterion accommodates any form, including general risk measures. This not only addresses important machine learning and operations management applications but also expands to general decision-theoretical frameworks previously unaddressed by Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a by-product, we show that Wasserstein DRO coincides with the recent max-sliced Wasserstein DRO for any decision criterion under affine decision rules, resulting in both being efficiently solvable as convex programs via our general regularization results. These general assurances provide a strong foundation for expanding the application of Wasserstein DRO across diverse domains of data-driven decision problems.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12371476 and 71921001] and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2023-05829].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03895 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Do Purchase Preconditions Increase Purchase Intention? The Role of External Reference Points</title>
    <updated>2025-11-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retailers frequently advertise price promotions with purchase preconditions (i.e., minimum spending). This research provides a novel perspective for evaluating preconditions: treating them as external reference points (ERPs) that override consumers’ internal reference points (IRPs) and thus alter perceived discount magnitude. Specifically, consumers evaluate a discount without a precondition by comparing it with an IRP based on past experiences. Conversely, a discount with a precondition creates a new, salient benchmark (ERP) against which the discount is more likely to be evaluated. Due to this change in reference point, a precondition resets the consumer’s discount magnitude calculus, influencing their intentions to shop at the store. This can create dominance violations in which restricted discounts are preferred to their unrestricted counterparts, contingent on whether the precondition is below or above the IRP. The influence of a precondition as an ERP on discount magnitude perceptions is attenuated when the IRP is highly accessible in memory, or when the discount magnitude is already explicit in relative (e.g., percentage) terms. Additionally, similar effects can be produced with a product category restriction equivalent in value to the precondition, and the effect of adding a precondition is attenuated when the equivalent value reference is already present.</content>

    <title>Middle Managers’ Regulation of the Emotions of Others in Strategy Implementation: A Process Perspective</title>
    <updated>2025-11-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article develops a process model of how middle managers regulate the negative emotions of their team members to support strategy implementation. Based on a 9‐month ethnographic study in a public broadcasting company, we examine how managers navigate emotionally charged resistance to top‐down strategic themes during meetings. While prior research emphasizes individual techniques, we show that emotion regulation of others (ERO) unfolds as a sequenced process involving three interconnected phases: understanding emotional status, interpersonal tuning, and encouraging reappraisal. Our findings highlight that emotional influence is not achieved through isolated tactics, but through temporally coordinated and relationally attuned practices. In doing so, the study reconciles the tension between validating negative emotions and enabling emotional change. It advances research on middle managers by theorizing how they navigate emotional resistance in real time and contributes to ERO theory by demonstrating the importance of temporal coordination between validation and reappraisal.</content>

    <title>Why is Bribing Doctors an Excusable Crime? The Normalization of Professional Corruption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professional corruption is a pervasive issue with significant societal consequences. This study investigates the normalization of professional corruption by examining bribery among physicians in Chinese hospitals, where informal payments, or ‘red packets’, from patients were often reported despite being illegal. Drawing on a qualitative case study, we develop a process model comprising four mutually reinforcing building blocks: organizational arrangements, which capture distinct features of professional campuses that enable corruption; constrained supervision, which weakens institutional governance and limits accountability to clients; rationalizations, through which professionals justify informal payments by emphasizing professional expertise and social respect while downplaying the social trusteeship value; and socialization, which operates through a combination of structural assurance and backstage cocoons that desensitize professionals to the ethical implications of bribery. Furthermore, we highlight the role of cultural resonance in linking corrupt practices to traditional gift‐giving customs, thereby legitimating informal payments in professional contexts. Our findings contribute to understanding how organizational factors and cultural traditions jointly enable corruption, offering insights applicable to other professional organizations while emphasizing important boundary conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how firms attempt to preempt activism before it mobilizes into an active threat. Employing a difference‐in‐differences design, we examine the quasi‐exogenous enactments of laws that prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti‐SLAPP laws) in the United States. We find evidence suggesting that in response to the enactment of anti‐SLAPP laws, firms self‐regulate through enhancing their institutional corporate social performance (institutional CSP). This response is more pronounced in firms with greater firm‐specific activism risk, as evidenced by greater media coverage on firms' social irresponsibility. These findings suggest that, in response to activism risk, firms attempt to keep activists from targeting them by preemptively engaging in self‐regulatory improvement in their institutional CSP. The preemptive action we document extends research on stakeholder activism.Managerial SummaryBy analyzing how US firms respond to the enactment of laws that prevent Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti‐SLAPP laws), we find that in anticipation of activist attacks, firms enhance their institutional corporate social performance (institutional CSP). This proactive response is more evident in firms facing a heightened risk of activism, such as those with substantial media exposure for socially irresponsible outcomes. We suggest the looming institutional risk of activism prompts firms to engage in self‐regulatory adaptation in enhancing their institutional CSP, hopefully mitigating the risk of being targeted by stakeholder activists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Planogram Design and Display Fees on Retail Category Management</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of planogram design (i.e., placement of products on shelves) and display fees (i.e., fees manufacturers pay retailers for prime shelf space) on a retailer’s category management strategy and interactions with national brand manufacturers (NBMs). We consider a game-theoretic model with one retailer and multiple NBMs. Each NBM offers one product. In addition, the retailer has the option to introduce a store brand (SB) product. If the retailer decides to introduce its SB, it needs to drop one of the national brand (NB) products from its assortment because it has limited shelf space. The retailer’s planogram has one prime shelf space and multiple nonprime shelf spaces. The prime shelf space has a demand-stimulating impact. The NBMs determine their wholesale prices and how much they are willing to pay for the prime shelf space. The retailer makes SB introduction and planogram decisions. It also sets the quantities for each product in its assortment, resulting in market-clearing retail prices. Our analysis leads to three key findings: First, the presence of a prime shelf space may not only prevent the retailer from introducing its SB but also lead to sizable changes in the retail and wholesale prices in the category. For example, an extensive numerical study reveals that receiving the prime shelf space increases an NB product’s retail price by 5.48%. The average increase in the same product’s wholesale price is 2.52%, as the prospect of charging a higher wholesale price incentivizes its manufacturer to pay a display fee for securing the prime shelf space. Second, there are cases in which the retailer uses SB introduction as a strategic lever to intensify the competition for the prime shelf space and thereby increase its revenue from display fees. Third, despite being an additional expense, display fees can increase the NBMs’ profits by allowing them to influence the retailer’s assortment and planogram decisions in their favor. We discuss the implications of these findings for managers and researchers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Generative AI Announcements on Suppliers: Evidence from the Stock Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) technology is revolutionizing firm operations and supply chain management, profoundly influencing firms within the GenAI supply chain network. While a few emerging studies have explored the impact of GenAI initiatives on firms’ stock performance, it remains unclear how such disruptive technology initiatives affect the stock price movements of their supply chain partners. This paper empirically investigates the impact of firms’ GenAI initiatives on the abnormal stock returns of their suppliers by analyzing data on news, supply chain relationships, and daily stock prices. The analysis indicates that, on average, a firm’s GenAI announcement leads to a positive abnormal return of 0.27% for its suppliers on the announcement day, with additional evidence of sustained long-term value creation. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that this spillover effect is more pronounced among suppliers with higher R&amp;D intensity, stronger sales growth, closer geographic proximity to the focal firm, and operations in less competitive industries. Furthermore, the positive abnormal returns are significantly greater when the GenAI initiative pertains to product innovation rather than process improvement. Our findings have important implications for supply chain stakeholders navigating the adoption of GenAI technologies.</content>

Such effects are particularly important in healthcare systems which often operate under resource and time constraints. In much of the literature, this effect of workload has been primarily considered at the system and instantaneous level rather than the individual and cumulative level. In this study, we investigate this relationship in the context of cardiac surgery, i.e., how surgery duration and patient outcomes are affected by the individual surgeon’s daily workload. Using a detailed data set of more than 5,600 cardiac operations in a large hospital, we quantify how individual surgeon daily workload (the number of operations performed by the focal surgeon) affects surgery duration and patient outcomes. To handle the endogeneity of surgeon daily workload, we construct instrumental variables using operational factors of the cardiac surgery department, including the regular surgery schedule of surgeons. We find that high daily workload for the focal surgeon is associated with longer surgery duration as well as post-surgery length-of-stay in the ICU and hospital. These results highlight the potential negative impact of high individual surgeon workload. We develop a surgical scheduling model that incorporates the estimated impact of surgeon daily workload. We solve the model by mixed-integer quadratic programming and show that our proposed schedule can substantially reduce total OR time and post-surgery length-of-stay. Our results suggest that hospitals should take into account the effects of individual surgeon daily workload when managing their ORs. Specifically, they can substantially improve patient flow and patient outcomes by smoothing individual surgeon’s workload across days.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, earnings call slide decks (hereafter, earnings decks) have become increasingly common in the earnings announcements of public firms. In this paper, I examine the characteristics of earnings decks and the determinants of firms’ use of them. More importantly, I study their capital market roles. While I fail to find evidence that earnings decks on average offer information incremental to traditional disclosures, such as press releases and conference calls, they significantly reduce users’ information processing time. My analyses reveal three mechanisms that contribute to this acceleration: inclusion of visuals (e.g., charts and tables), summarization of key information, and release prior to earnings calls. Overall, this study documents a novel aspect of earnings announcements and highlights the role of multimedia elements in reducing information processing costs of corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72402110, 72442014].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04956 .</content>

    <title>A Framework for Selecting Action Portfolios with Incomplete and Action-Dependent Scenario Probabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies pursue their goals by selecting and implementing a combination or portfolio of actions that consume resources. The extent to which these actions help attain the companies’ objectives is often contingent on whether a given future scenario is realized. In this paper, we present a model-based framework for supporting the selection of a portfolio of actions that is robust across different scenarios while accounting for the impacts that the actions may have on the probabilities of these scenarios. For the purposes of this framework, we develop a new portfolio decision analytic model and algorithms to help generate recommendations for selecting actions, when (i) the actions’ scenario- and objective-specific impacts, as well as preferences between the objectives are incompletely specified, and (ii) information regarding scenario probabilities is incomplete and may depend on the selected actions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive report on the application of the framework in a high-impact case on supporting the strategy process at the payments unit of Nordea Bank Abp, the largest retail bank in the Nordic countries. Based on retrospective interviews with the participants in this strategy process, three kinds of impacts from the use of our framework could be identified: (i) actions related to implementing the decision recommendations and strengthening the required capabilities, (ii) information to help evaluate these decision recommendations as the future unfolded, and (iii) behavioral changes in terms of elevating the level of strategic discussions.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Liikesivistysrahasto [Grant 16-9442].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05383 .</content>

    <title>Deciphering the PCAOB Inspection Process: Evidence and Predictive Insights from Public Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Little is known about how the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) selects audits for inspections. We exploit public data that track PCAOB searches of issuer Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and the trial transcripts of United States of America v. David Middendorf to provide the first large-sample evidence on confidential PCAOB monitoring activities. We initially validate that PCAOB searches spike during actual inspections of triennially inspected auditors and for a list of KPMG audits inspected in 2016. Importantly, we find that PCAOB searches vary predictably with ongoing audit-flagged events, client corporate events, and client characteristics, and these screening and inspection activities extend beyond enforcement actions. Using KPMG data, we introduce a PCAOB inspection prediction model for Big 4 clients based solely on public data, with predicted incidence closely aligning with actual inspections. One implication of our study is that, perhaps to mitigate political costs, the PCAOB relies overly on conspicuous trigger events that already signal low audit quality (i.e., restatements, auditor changes, chief financial officer turnovers, bankruptcies, and SEC comment letters), raising the question of how its risk-based inspection program is designed to improve overall audit quality or minimize large audit failures. In addition, although model-inferred PCAOB inspections are not associated with future restatements, broader PCAOB monitoring activities, as proxied by search intensity, exhibit modest predictive power. Overall, our study provides a more nuanced understanding of the PCAOB inspection program and the factors driving its revealed preferences.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University, Baruch College, and the Penn State Smeal College of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.08084 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this crowdsourced initiative, 57 independent analysts used the same longitudinal dataset to address four major empirical questions in international business. For all four research questions, different analysts obtained substantial estimates in opposite directions, meaning that they could have drawn any conclusion at all had they conducted the project alone. Aggregating across the results obtained by different analysts pointed to an overall answer for two of the four research questions, although for one of the two questions, the evidence was more suggestive than conclusive. That said, the variability in results was not simply random, and could in some cases be meaningfully explained. Choices regarding how to operationalize variables played an important role in determining the empirical results, and expert analysts were more likely to report large positive effects. Rather than exhibiting a bias to confirm their pre-existing beliefs, analysts appeared to rationally update their beliefs considering the evidence. Overall, these findings empirically demonstrate the role of subjective researcher choices in shaping results in international business research yet also show that it is still possible to draw meaningful conclusions in science. We advocate for an open science of international business in which the consequences of subjective analytic choices are rendered as transparent as possible.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploiting changes in countries’ competition laws, we find that competition increases firms’ propensity to use zero leverage (ZL). We test the financial-flexibility, financial-constraint, and quiet-life explanations for this result, concluding that desire for flexibility is the one most likely. The relation between competition and ZL strengthens with cash-flow volatility, which supports the flexibility motive. Adoption of ZL by firms is accompanied by increases in payouts, so it is unlikely that ZL adopters are constrained. Proxies for governance have no effect on the relation between competition and ZL, suggesting that desire for a quiet life is not the explanation either.</content>

    <title>Conceptualizing Consumer Body Awareness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research typically treats body awareness as a subset of self-awareness, which emphasizes identity and appearance at the expense of embodied sensations. This article offers a corrective by reconceptualizing consumer body awareness as a distinct, cultivated capacity, defined as the ability to notice, make sense of, and respond to exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive sensations with the help of marketplace resources. Prior studies show that consumers are increasingly turning to the marketplace to find bodily reconnection and seek relief from the disembodied pull of digitalized, market-mediated life. Research also shows that while marketplace resources can help build body awareness, they can also distract from it. What the literature does not explain is how consumers engage with marketplace resources as their body awareness evolves. Building on an ethnographic inquiry into ultra-running, this article introduces a four-stage process of cultivating consumer body awareness: attuning, listening, connecting, and integrating. Findings show how marketplace resources both enable and obstruct body learning across these stages, ultimately recalibrating consumption choices and brand relationships.</content>

    <title>The Use and Usefulness of Attention Checks in Behavioral Research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Attention checks have been touted as a means of excluding inattentive and careless responses from survey data. As a result, numerous approaches have been proposed, but which are most helpful has received less interest. The present paper demonstrates this blind spot has obscured vast differences in attention check efficacy. An initial survey of consumer-behavior and decision-making researchers revealed six commonly used attention check approaches (memory checks, questions with obvious answers, English comprehension, self-reported attentiveness, straight-lining, and variations on the Instructional Manipulation Check). These were then paired with six effects, drawn from the Many Labs series of papers in social psychology (N &amp;gt; 22,000, all pre-registered). The different checks varied substantially at reducing noise and increasing effect size. Follow-up studies suggest that participant attentiveness, as currently measured, may reflect a given participant’s general approach to completing studies, rather than momentary fatigue or boredom varying across time or within studies. We recommend behavioral researchers focus their efforts on going beyond mere “pulse-checkers” and consider favoring the use of memory checks and obvious questions as attention checks in their research.</content>

    <title>Do Earnings Announcements Affect Employee Spending? Evidence from Transaction Data*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging micro‐level data on individual employees’ bank and credit card transactions, we examine the impact of earnings announcement (EA) news on employee spending. Utilizing an event study methodology, we find strong evidence that EA news elicits significant reactions in employee spending. These reactions are stronger for employees located in the firm's headquarters state, with longer tenure, possessing investment experience, or earning higher wages, consistent with these employees being more likely to attend to their firm's EAs. The reactions are also stronger for the fourth fiscal quarter than interim quarters, suggesting that year‐end results garner greater employee attention. Furthermore, consistent with media facilitating employee processing of EA news, the reactions are stronger for EAs covered by a larger number of news articles. Finally, in line with the notion that EAs contain information about employees’ future cash flows, we find that EA news predicts changes in employee wages and that employees with higher past wage‐to‐EA news sensitivity exhibit stronger spending reactions. Overall, our findings provide evidence of the role of financial reporting in employees’ spending decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To decide about retirement, employees assess and react to their work environment, including age‐inclusive HR practices. Age‐inclusive HR practices ensure equal access to key HR functions for all employees—regardless of age, for example, training and development for all age groups, unlike age‐specific HR practices, which target older workers exclusively, for example, development opportunities for older workers. In this study, we uncover why age‐inclusive HR practices are effective in retaining older employees. Using a conservation of resources theory approach, we explain that age‐inclusive HR practices can enhance older employees' employability (i.e., perceived ability to realize job opportunities within and between employers) and reduce their job insecurity (i.e., perceived risk of a decline in job quality, including working conditions, career prospects, and salary). Employability, conversely, weakens employees' retirement intentions, while job insecurity strengthens these intentions. We use a three‐wave design with 758 older employees and path analysis, controlling for age‐specific HR practices, to demonstrate the unique effect of age‐inclusive HR practices on employees' retirement intentions. Findings showed that age‐inclusive HR practices (beyond age‐specific HR practices) were indirectly linked to employees' retirement intentions via job insecurity but not employability, emphasizing their importance for resource loss prevention as a means for older employees' retention.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit a panel of city-level data with rich demographic information to estimate the distributional effects of Department of Defense spending and its effects on a range of social outcomes. The income and employment generated by defense spending accrue predominantly to households without a bachelor’s degree. These households as well as Black and Hispanic households tend to disproportionately benefit from this spending. Defense spending also promotes a range of beneficial social outcomes that are often targeted by government programs, including reductions in poverty, divorce rates, disability rates, and mortality rates, as well as increases in homeownership rates, health insurance rates, and occupational prestige. We compare the effects of defense spending with the effects of general demand shocks and explore reasons for the differential effects of the shocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study moves beyond the traditional atomistic view of firms engaged in alliance agreements. By integrating current research on internal organizational design with research on interfirm collaboration, we investigate the implications of the organizational design of parent firms for the design and governance of technology partnerships. More specifically, we propose that in a research and development (R&amp;D) alliance between a client firm and an R&amp;D firm, the client firm’s internal organizational structure in R&amp;D plays an important role in alliance design and governance. Centralized firms are better able to integrate knowledge in the organization compared with decentralized firms, and hence, we theorize that they will design their technology partnerships for greater knowledge access. Empirical findings from alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry offer support for our predictions: firms with centralized R&amp;D decision making are more likely to capture intellectual property rights. Further, these firms tend to engage in alliances with broader vertical and horizontal scope and greater technological interdependence in order to access, recombine, and distribute knowledge. This study extends research on alliance design and governance by underscoring the important influence of a partner firm’s organizational structure.</content>

    <title>The Failure to Recognize Anti-Asian Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Anti-Asian discrimination remains prevalent in the United States but continues to be reported and charged at low levels. In the current research, we seek to understand this puzzle in the context of workplace discrimination. Integrating the literature on the U.S. racial status hierarchy—which positions Asian Americans as an intermediate status group situated in between White and Black Americans—with the prototype model of attributions to discrimination, we propose that lay observers do not consider Asian Americans to be prototypical targets of racial discrimination. As a result, we predict that observers are less likely to attribute potentially discriminatory incidents to discrimination when those incidents involve Asian (compared with Black) targets. We find evidence supporting our predictions across two studies assessing prototypes of targets of racial discrimination (Studies 1 and 2), three preregistered experiments comparing attributions to discrimination for Asian and Black job candidates (Studies 3–5), and a data set of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission discrimination charges (Study 6). Our research makes theoretical advances on the racial experience of Asian employees by identifying Asian Americans as nonprototypical targets of racism and underscoring the relative failure of attributions to discrimination as an insidious problem that likely perpetuates anti-Asian racism at work.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18628 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce partial law invariance, generalizing law invariance, and probabilistic sophistication widely used in decision theory, as well as statistical and financial applications. Partial law invariance may be interpreted as law invariance restricted to events for which there is no model uncertainty, reflecting practical situations in decision theory and financial risk management. We fully characterize partially law-invariant coherent risk measures via a novel representation formula. Strong partial law invariance is defined to bridge the gap between the above characterization and the classic representation formula of Kusuoka. We propose a few classes of new risk measures, including partially law-invariant versions of the expected shortfall and the entropic risk measures, and illustrate their applications in risk assessment under different types of uncertainty. We provide a tractable optimization formula for computing a class of partially law-invariant coherent risk measures and give a numerical example.This paper was accepted by Aurélien Baillon, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grants CRC-2022-00141, RGPIN-2020-04356, and RGPIN-2024-03728].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06518 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Users are now typically able to access historical data in traffic, restaurant, and retailing contexts. This availability of information can be viewed as a means to reduce congestion. However, scientific support for this notion is weak. We investigate, using a laboratory experiment, whether an intermediate level of information provision might reduce congestion. We also study how the effect of making more information available changes over time. We show that providing all users with information is counterproductive in the short run. In the long run, users’ behavior adjusts so that providing some or all individuals with information leads to more efficient outcomes than when no information is made available. Small Sample models capture a number of the patterns in the data, in particular the switching behavior between routes. The data show that making congestion information available to all parties reduces efficiency early on but is beneficial in the long run.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors thank the Economic Science Laboratory at the University of Arizona and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72403135] for funding.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00056 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document effects of the opioid epidemic on the migration and output of skilled workers who drive corporate innovation. Exploiting geographic variation in opioid abuse unrelated to economic conditions and using both patent and home sales-based measures, we show that inventors and research labs exit affected areas. This displacement is accompanied by declines in the quantity and value of patents of approximately 7% and $10.6 million per year, respectively. Declines in school quality, safety, and other amenities drive the out-migration. Because displaced workers are unlikely to abuse opioids, our results represent spillover effects of opioid abuse on nonusers.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: The project received funding from the University of Kansas’s General Research Fund and Troesh Center Research Grants from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

    <title>Reclaiming Relevance Through Problem‐Driven Interdisciplinary Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management studies initially emerged as an applied field, uniquely positioned to tackle practical organizational problems through interdisciplinary research. Over time, however, the field has prioritized abstract theoretical contributions over real‐world engagement, fragmenting into disciplinary silos ill‐equipped to address complex contemporary management problems, such as climate change, technological disruptions, and social inequalities. Although this theoretical turn has deepened the rigor of the field, it has eroded the field’s distinct value and relevance. We call for management studies to reclaim its applied origins through interdisciplinary, problem‐driven research, which leverages the field’s unique integrative capacity while preserving theoretical depth. Drawing on Herbert Simon’s distinction between well‐ and ill‐structured problems, we propose a framework that matches problem types to appropriate forms of interdisciplinary engagement: coordination for moderately well‐structured issues, collaboration for moderately ill‐structured ones, and co‐creation for highly ill‐structured challenges. This framework offers a conceptual scaffold for scholars seeking to engage with pressing organizational and societal challenges while navigating the institutional and epistemic barriers to interdisciplinary research. By returning to its applied origins through problem‐driven, interdisciplinary research, management studies can restore both its scholarly legitimacy and societal relevance.</content>

    <title>Opportunity Search in the Era of GenAI: Navigating Uncertainty in an Expanding Universe of Imaginable but Unknowable Futures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship has often been viewed through a lens of scarcity of creativity. Yet, the arrival of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) forces us to appreciate that the bottleneck of entrepreneurship is not the lack of creative ideas but Knightian Uncertainty. In an era of abundant entrepreneurial ideas, what matters is whether AI‐generated entrepreneurial futures are possible or figments of machine imagination. However, extant theory offers little guidance on navigating opportunity uncertainty – let alone amid an ever‐expanding universe of AI‐generated ideas that increases the risk of unsustainable venturing. Addressing what we theorize as a “grand epistemological challenge”, we develop a model of intelligent opportunity search. The architecture of the model is informed by Gerd Gigerenzer’s paradigm shift in decision‐making under uncertainty, centred on the use of heuristics that match the structure of the environment. Our model advances a symbiotic division of epistemic labour between machine and human intelligence guided by decision strategies attuned to the structure of the decision environment as reshaped in the GenAI era. The gist of the model is that machine creativityexpandsthe ideation space through generative variation, while human judgmentcontractsit through a curation process geared towards the elimination of non‐opportunities. This structured opportunity detection process reflects a new ecology of entrepreneurial action, where successful opportunity search depends less on human creativity and imagination and more on eliminating what cannot be actualized. Besides advancing a novel perspective on the nature of human and machine symbiosis, this paper unpacks implications for opportunity theory and Knightian Uncertainty.</content>

    <title>Expert Memories: The Professional Construction of the Past and the Mnemonic Making of Occupations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article introduces the special issue on occupations and memory in organizations. To foster increasing collaboration from scholars from both fields, we offer a general argument connecting memory and occupations on two levels. At the societal level, we show how memory experts, such as historians, archivists, and museologists, have played a fundamental role in the development of modernity and the emergence of our contemporary historical consciousness. At the occupational level, we argue that occupations are transgenerational communities maintained through various practices and technologies of memory whose legitimacy and professional status increasingly depend on their ability to cultivate both practical and historical memory. We further explore three related topics covered by the papers from this special issue: expert and memory work, occupational and mnemonic communities, and professional and mnemonic projects. At the end, we identify three promising themes for future research: the negotiation of boundaries and resources among communities; the interaction between technology, expertise, and memory; and the occupational ethics and responsibility towards past actions and memories.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do cities grow in the process of structural transformation? To answer this question, we develop a multi-sector spatial equilibrium model with endogenous land use: land is used either for agriculture or housing. Urban land, densely populated due to commuting frictions, expands out of agricultural land. With low productivity and high subsistence needs, farmland is expensive, households cannot afford large homes and cities are very dense. Increasing productivity reallocates factors away from agriculture, freeing up land for urban expansion and limiting the increase in land values despite higher income and urban population. With the area of cities growing faster than urban population, urban density can persistently decline, as in the data over a long period. The quantitative evaluation calibrated to historical data assembled for France over 180 years explains a large fraction of the joint evolution of urban areas, population density and land values across time and space.</content>

    <title>Putting Climate into Context: How Culture and Composition Shape the Effects of Diversity Climate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing evidence demonstrates that an organization’s diversity climate can enhance its bottom line. Though some scholars theorize potential mediators to explain these effects, recent meta-analytic and literature reviews conclude that much remains unknown regarding both why diversity climate influences outcomes and how sociocultural factors within and beyond the organization may shape its implications. We propose that unit-level diversity climate stands to produce more uniformly positive affective commitment levels (i.e., higher commitment mean and lower commitment dispersion), thereby optimizing the returns on human capital investments in the form of greater unit productivity. Data from 738 stores in 48 American states indicate a significant indirect effect of unit diversity climate on productivity through affective commitment mean and dispersion. Moreover, we apply the concept of climate context congruence to extend diversity climate theory and explore the influence of alignment among unit-level diversity climate, unit composition (i.e., racioethnic diversity), and cultural tightness–looseness (i.e., state tightness–looseness) in the geographic region within which the unit is operating. In doing so, we offer a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of the sociocultural conditions wherein supportive diversity climates may be differentially beneficial. Our results support the notion that organizations may reap greater benefits of diversity climate when state culture and unit composition align (i.e., tighter/homogenous, or looser/diverse) to accentuate diversity climate efficacy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper analyses how post-trade netting in over-the-counter derivatives markets affects systemic risk. It defines the notion of a post-trade netting (PTN) exercise and shows that two post-trade netting services that rely on multilateral netting techniques, namely, portfolio rebalancing and portfolio compression, are special cases of a PTN exercise. It formally characterises the relationship between portfolio rebalancing and portfolio compression. The paper then analyses the effects of post-trade netting from a network perspective by considering contagion arising from defaults on variation margin payments. It provides sufficient conditions for post-trade netting to reduce systemic risk and shows that post-trade netting can be harmful. It also explores the implications of post-trade netting when institutions strategically react to liquidity stress by delaying their payments.</content>

    <title>Active Learning for Nonparametric Choice Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding consumer preferences is crucial for designing better products, optimizing assortments, and personalizing recommendations. In “Active Learning for Nonparametric Choice Models,” Fransisca Susan, Negin Golrezaei, Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh, and David Kempe present an active learning approach that efficiently uncovers the most informative patterns in the choices made by members of a heterogeneous population. Instead of relying solely on historical transaction data, their method strategically selects sets of products to offer and then uses the responses to construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of preferences. This DAG captures the top k choices, their probabilities, and how they relate to each other as k changes. Experiments on synthetic and real‐world data show that the method learns preferences more accurately—and with fewer data points—than leading offline techniques. This work advances both the theory and practice of preference learning, with implications for retail, online platforms, and artificial intelligence agents that need to model human decision making.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Scheduling of a Multiclass Queue in the Halfin–Whitt Regime: A Computational Approach for High-Dimensional Problems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a multiclass queueing model of a telephone call center in which a system manager dynamically allocates available servers to customer calls. Calls can terminate through either service completion or customer abandonment, and the manager strives to minimize the expected total of holding costs plus abandonment costs over a finite horizon. Focusing on the Halfin–Whitt heavy traffic regime, we derive an approximating diffusion control problem and, building on earlier work by Beck et al. [Beck C, Becker S, Cheridito P, Jentzen A, Neufeld A (2021) Deep splitting method for parabolic PDEs. SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43(5):A3135–A3154], develop a simulation-based computational method for solution of such problems, one that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. Using this computational method, we propose a policy for the original (prelimit) call center scheduling problem. Finally, the performance of this policy is assessed using test problems based on publicly available call center data. For the test problems considered so far, our policy does as well as or better than the best benchmark we could find. Moreover, our method is computationally feasible at least up to dimension 500, that is, for call centers with 500 or more distinct customer classes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, stochastic models and simulation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03921 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many jurisdictions have launched antitrust enforcement and brought in regulation of large tech platforms. The swift and strict implementation of China’s Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Platform Economy (Platform Guidelines) provides a quasi-natural experiment to evaluate the impact of antitrust regulation on platform competition. We adopt a difference-in-differences approach to empirically explore the impact of China’s Platform Guidelines on the number of investments and the entry of startups in platform markets. The results show that the Platform Guidelines did not increase entrepreneurship in these affected markets. Rather, entrepreneurship weakened in these markets, with less venture capital investment flowing into them and fewer startups entering these markets. Our study suggests that governments should consider more carefully the potential unintended consequences of antitrust platform regulation.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Managerial Prosocial Preferences and Guilt as an Emotional Barrier to Exit Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite economic setbacks, managers may resist exiting to avoid harming employees who will lose their jobs. We propose that managers with higher prosocial preferences set lower exit thresholds and select conservative investments that reduce the risk of having to exit because they experience stronger feelings of anticipatory guilt. Our field study shows that, in responding to intensifying Chinese import competition, prosocial managers are less likely to exit or divest. Our experiments (N = 1,411), including a sample of senior executives, show that anticipatory guilt mediates the negative effect of prosocial preferences on exit thresholds and risky investments. Anticipatory guilt and its effect are stronger when employees suffer greater harm from the firm’s exit due to the absence of social insurance programs, such as public health insurance or unemployment insurance. Our study presents an emotion-processual account of firm exit decisions and highlights anticipatory guilt as an emotional barrier to efficient decision-making.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02533 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How are asset price volatility and liquidity impacted by public perception of the economic state and by market competitivity? We wish to understand the direct impacts as well as indirect impacts via information acquisition and aggregation. To investigate, we design a laboratory experiment with human subjects as bond investors and exogenously vary the bond default rate, the private information cost schedule, and the market format. To discipline the experiment parameters and to obtain hypotheses for empirical testing, we construct a theoretical model that closely parallels the experiment. We find that the laboratory data support most theoretical predictions, for example, liquidity increases when traders purchase more precise private information, when public information indicates a less ominous state, and when the market is less competitive. Overall price volatility also increases with more precise private information and less competitivity, but it decreases with less ominous public information. Decomposing volatility into “efficient” and “inefficient” components may offer insight for policy analysis.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by University of California Santa Cruz.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04911 .</content>

    <title>Model Aggregation for Risk Evaluation and Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new approach for prudent risk evaluation based on stochastic dominance, and it is called the model aggregation (MA) approach. In contrast to the classic worst case risk (WR) approach, the MA approach produces not only a robust value of risk evaluation but also a robust distributional model, independent of any specific risk measure. The MA risk evaluation can be computed through explicit formulas in the lattice theory of stochastic dominance, and under some standard assumptions, the MA robust optimization admits a convex program reformulation. The MA approach for Wasserstein and mean-variance uncertainty sets admits explicit formulas for the obtained robust models. Via an equivalence property between the MA and WR approaches, new axiomatic characterizations are obtained for the value at risk and the expected shortfall (also known as conditional value at risk). The new approach is illustrated with various risk measures and examples from portfolio optimization.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 12371476, 71921001, 71671176, 71871208], the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grants CRC-2022-00141, RGPIN-2024-03728, RGPAS-2018-522590, RGPIN-2018-03823], and the Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03523 .</content>

    <title>Examining the Effect of a Firm’s AI Specialization on the Technology Firms it Acquires: A Real Options Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The digital revolution is transforming global business practices. As organizations increasingly embed artificial intelligence (AI) within their operations, they face unprecedented uncertainty regarding future technological trajectories and competitive landscapes. To maintain competitiveness in the emerging technological space, they need to promptly acquire advanced knowledge to enrich their technological portfolio. Drawing on real options theory (ROT), our study integrates AI‐based acquisitions with internal AI development. We posit that a firm’s AI specialization represents the accumulation of critical technological knowledge and creates a portfolio of strategic options. These options can subsequently be exercised as AI acquisitions to secure complementary external capabilities. Moreover, the efficacy of these options is contingent on distinct uncertainties, including technical, modal, and complementarity uncertainties, captured by target R&amp;D intensity, target self‐fluidity, and product market overlap, respectively. Using a sample of US public firms that carried out acquisitions from 2004 to 2015, we find support for our hypotheses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the recognition that newcomers’ ego networks facilitate their adjustment, little is known about changes in their ego-network structures over time and potential drivers for the network changes. Drawing on coevolutionary theory of network dynamics and integrating insights from research on socialization dynamics, we examine the change-related, reciprocal relationships between perceived supervisor behaviors—specifically support and undermining—and structural holes in newcomers’ ego networks (i.e., the extent to which newcomers connect otherwise disconnected individuals). Using latent change score (LCS) modeling in a longitudinal study of new employees, we found evidence of coevolution: perceived supervisor undermining hindered their development of ego networks with increasingly more structural holes; in turn, newcomers who spanned structural holes in their ego networks experienced increasingly more supervisor undermining. Additionally, those whose networks are rich in structural holes perceived increasingly less supervisor support over time. These findings have implications for research on socialization and structural holes.</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Reliability at the Helm: Investigating the Relationship Between Experienced Algorithmic Reliability, Trust, and Work Engagement in the Gig Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the gig economy, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in managing human resource functions such as task allocation and performance management is increasingly significant. However, there is limited understanding of how the reliability of these functions, as experienced by workers, impacts their trust and engagement. Grounded in the transactional model of stress and coping, this study examines the influence of experienced algorithmic reliability on gig workers' trust in their platforms and their subsequent work engagement. We further explore how occupational stigma consciousness moderates this mediated relationship. Through a time‐lagged survey of 332 gig workers, our findings indicate that reliable algorithmic management experiences significantly enhance trust and subsequently work engagement. Moreover, this relationship is complicated by occupational stigma consciousness, which can diminish the positive effects of algorithmic reliability on trust and engagement. This study deepens our understanding of technology‐mediated work environments, emphasizing the critical role of workers' experiences with AI‐driven HRM functions in enhancing engagement and well‐being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend recent work on knowledge problems by observing that the complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty of entrepreneurship pertain not only to action-outcome likelihoods but also to the very criteria of entrepreneurial judgment. Most judgment criteria—value, opportunity, options, outcomes, etc.—are “fuzzy,” rendering much of entrepreneurial judgment imperfectly suited for probabilistic analysis. Fuzzy sets and natural language accommodate partial category membership, thus offering a more approximate representation of the remarkable ability of the entrepreneurial mind to conceptualize ill-structured and abstract problems. We explain how entrepreneurs use linguistic variables to navigate and convey the complex, gradient nature of uncertainty.</content>

    <title>‘Marching to Someone Else’s Beat or Creating Your Own Groove?’ Towards a Rhythmic Understanding of Context, (Entrepreneurial) Agency, and Transformative Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How contexts shape organizational phenomena has long been a focus of management and organization studies (MOS), as has how actors influence contexts. This paper deepens this debate using a rhythm perspective, developed against the backdrop of entrepreneurship research, which has made context a priority but not fully clarified how entrepreneurial agency alters contextual conditions. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre’sRhythmanalysis, we argue that the everyday provides a privileged vantage point for understanding how contextual forces permeate entrepreneurship and, conversely, how they are affected by it. Specifically, we theorize that the everyday forms a diverse and shifting symphony of rhythms, and suggest that entrepreneurial agency includes the transformative capacity to shape these rhythms to create tangible value. We refine our theorizing through the example of the Brukman textile factory, an entrepreneurial squat taken over by its former workers. The vignette explores how agency is enacted through the cultivation of moments of rupture (arrhythmia) and moments of rhythmic harmony (eurhythmia). Our contribution is to develop a rhythm perspective to spark new ways of thinking about context, agency, and transformative change. While our theorizing is rooted in entrepreneurship research, we identify ways in which it can stimulate MOS more broadly.</content>

    <title>‘Let Me Explain’: A Comparative Field Study on How Experts Enact Authority Over Clients When Facing AI Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With organizations increasingly relying on predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for decision‐making, experts lose the authority to overrule AI‐generated decisions yet remain responsible for presenting them to clients. As experts depend on clients’ recognition and approval of decisions, this shift presents a critical disruption to their authority. To investigate how experts respond to this challenge, we adopt a relational perspective that foregrounds the role of audiences in reconfiguring authority. Drawing on a comparative field study, we show how experts sought to reconstruct their authority by engaging in different activities to make clients understand and accept AI decisions, which we call ‘explaining practices’. These practices were shaped by two relational conditions: (1) whether clients recognized the expertise of human experts as unique; and (2) whether interactions between experts and clients provided rich opportunities for learning about clients’ evolving needs. When experts were able to learn about and tailor their explanations to those needs, clients could better make sense of AI decisions and were more willing to accept them, thereby reinforcing expert authority. By contrast, experts who failed to do so left clients with decisions they could not understand or endorse, undermining their authority. This study thereby offers new insights into the complex interplay between expert–client relationships, expert authority, and explaining practices.</content>

    <title>Helping Trajectories During Role Transitions: How They Vary and Why It Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While those transitioning into a new work role often rely on others to assist them, over time they are likely to also provide assistance to others. Accordingly, we examine the trajectories that the provision of such help by those transitioning take over time, as well as key trajectory determinants and socialization-related outcomes. Extending the Temporal Theory of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (TTOCB), we argue and find that such trajectories vary as a function of both the nature of the transition (i.e., transitioning as an organizational incumbent versus as an organizational newcomer), as well as the leadership and normative characteristics of the unit joined. Specifically, we propose and find that both newcomers and transitioning incumbents exhibit an inverted U-shaped helping trajectory, with the trajectory being significantly flatter for transitioning incumbents. Moreover, unit-level supportive leadership and peer descriptive helping norms moderate these trajectories. For both newcomers and transitioning incumbents, the helping trajectory is flatter in units with higher levels of supportive leadership or peer descriptive helping norms. Consistent with these dynamics, we hypothesize and find that variations in helping trajectories are associated with different levels of task performance, social integration, and turnover intentions one year after role entry. Specifically, individuals exhibiting higher and flatter helping trajectories demonstrate higher task performance, greater social integration, and lower turnover intentions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies using archival organizational structure data are not as prevalent as one might expect for such a critical strategy topic. We seek to facilitate more studies in this domain by introducing a novel, hand‐collected dataset of top management team compositions of S&amp;P 500 firms between 1993 and 2020. Alongside providing the original role titles, we use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to categorize executives' titles into 6 role groups and 12 hierarchical levels, enabling easier comparisons of structures across and within firms. Our findings not only align with prior research but also offer insights into industry‐specific structural changes, functional distributions within organizations, and the evolution of executive roles. This work also highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool to empirically investigate key strategy questions.Managerial SummaryOne of the most important decisions senior managers make pertains to defining their firms' organizational structures. However, obtaining data on firms' structures can be challenging due to difficulties in accessing data and comparing structures across firms. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset of top management team compositions of S&amp;P 500 firms between 1993 and 2020. Alongside providing the original names and job titles, we use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to categorize executives' titles into 6 role groups and 12 hierarchical levels, allowing easier comparisons of structures across and within firms. We hope that this new dataset will spur greater scholarly interest in organizational structure, offering insights into how firms are structured and the implications of these structures.</content>

    <title>Portfolio Regulation of Financial Institutions with Market Power</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how portfolio regulations affect risk sharing between financial institutions with market power. Unconstrained access to complete markets permits flexible exploitation of market power and induces inefficient risk sharing. Appropriate portfolio restrictions counteract this, improving liquidity and risk sharing by bundling securities with offsetting strategic incentives. However, excessive regulation can be counterproductive, destroying gains from trade. An application of our theory shows that cross-asset spillovers are critical for policy evaluation: in general equilibrium, risk sharing can improve even if certain asset-specific liquidity measures deteriorate. We also discuss the effects of asymmetric regulation for different institutions.</content>

    <title>Treasury Reuse and the Demand for Safe Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We theoretically and empirically show how the reuse of Treasury securities as collateral alleviates safe asset scarcity. Our model characterizes how reuse allows intermediaries to efficiently reallocate the safety benefits of long-term Treasury securities to a broader investor base. By reusing Treasury securities, intermediaries can access more collateral to create safe assets without interest rate risk. When the demand for safe assets is high, intermediaries increase reuse, distributing safe asset benefits to investors that value safety the most. Using supervisory data to calculate a dealer-level measure of reuse called the “collateral multiplier,” we empirically confirm the model’s main predictions. (JEL E40, E51, G20, G12)</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint, so that the re-solving technique is applied to alinear programwith additional slack variables amenable to practical computations and theoretical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Unraveling the Transformative Effects of Online Healthcare Consultation Services on Outpatient and Inpatient Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online healthcare consultation services (OHCS) hold immense potential to transform the healthcare industry. This study seeks to investigate the impact of doctors' participation in OHCS on offline outpatient and inpatient costs, addressing a critical yet underexplored area in the healthcare IT literature. Utilizing an exhaustive dataset from a high-level comprehensive hospital in China over a period of 42 months, we find that doctors' OHCS participation increases outpatient costs by 63.2% (¥268.510) and inpatient costs by 22.2% (¥2,365.092). These results remain robust after addressing endogeneity concerns through instrumental variable (IV) approaches and propensity score matching (PSM). Notably, mechanism tests reveal that OHCS participation enhances doctors' service volume expansion, cost-upgrading within services and patient mix changes, leading to induced demand and higher offline medical costs. Moreover, these effects are amplified for doctors with higher professional status. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and higher department crowding levels tend to mitigate these cost increases. This study makes several significant theoretical contributions. First, it expands the healthcare IT literature by uncovering the "dark side" of OHCS participation, showing that it raises medical costs by altering supply-demand dynamics, contrary to the cost-saving potential often associated with traditional healthcare IT. Second, it advances research on OHCS by identifying the mechanisms—service volume expansion, cost-upgrading within services and patient mix changes—through which OHCS participation influences offline costs. Third, it explores the heterogeneous effects of physician, environmental, and departmental characteristics on medical costs. Practically, our findings suggest that hospitals and policymakers should promote widespread OHCS participation to balance supply-demand dynamics, advance treatment standardization and differentiated payment models, establish a multi-dimensional physician performance evaluation system, and leverage AI technology to improve doctor-patient matching and resource scheduling—enabling the realization of online healthcare's potential without inadvertently driving up medical costs. This study highlights the nuanced implications of OHCS on offline healthcare costs, offering insights for improving its implementation in healthcare systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When ‘Year’ Feels near: How Year versus Length Framing Alters Time Perception and Consumer Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Time intervals can be framed either by a calendar year (e.g., “2015”) or by length (e.g., “10 years”), yet these ostensibly equivalent formats lead to systematically different judgments. Combining data from whiskey auctions with seven controlled experiments, we demonstrate that length framing elongates time perception compared to year framing, which we refer to as the year–length effect. As a result of changes in time perception, length framing increases the importance of time-related attributes in choice, leading to more favorable product evaluations in contexts where age enhances product value (e.g., whiskey evaluation) and to more negative evaluations in contexts where age reduces it (e.g., used goods). Process evidence implicates the logarithmic mental number line: years with large nominal values occupy a compressed region of the line, relative to small length numerals. These findings offer practical guidance on how time framing can be used to shape time perception and customer value.</content>

    <title>The Role of Status Incongruence in Employee Responses to Participative Leadership</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has focused on the negative effect of status incongruence, this paper offers an optimistic perspective as it relates to participative leadership. Status incongruence refers to a situation in which status characteristics of the supervisor and the subordinate are opposite to standard norms. Leaders who are younger, less educated, less experienced, or shorter tenured than their followers are status incongruent. Incorporating role congruity theory with the participative leadership literature, we argue that participative leaders in status incongruence will be able to boost subordinate affective commitment and organizational citizenship behaviors more than their counterparts with lower status incongruence. We further propose a moderated mediation model whereby the positive indirect relationship between participative leadership and subordinate organizational citizenship behaviors through affective commitment will be stronger for status incongruent dyads. By finding support for our hypotheses across two field studies, this work suggests role congruity theory to consider leadership style as well as multiple status indicators together in understanding how role (in)congruity arises for leaders with varying levels of status incongruence. Suggestions for how human resource (HR) managers should consider leadership style as part of their HR strategy for fostering participative workplaces are offered.</content>
