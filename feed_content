    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs must navigate complex environmental shifts that significantly impact firm survival. In this paper, we investigate how different firm‐level logics influence new venture survival in Jordan during changing social and economic conditions, such as a refugee influx. Our study reveals that these shifting environmental dynamics can differentially alter the performance outcomes of firms based on their internal logics that drive venture strategy. This dynamic relationship underscores how varying firm‐level logics can alter the impact of environmental changes on new venture performance. These findings provide guidance to entrepreneurs to be aware of their venture's underlying values and principles and consider how they may impact business decisions and outcomes in the face of changing circumstances.Managerial SummaryThis study examines the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on new venture performance in Jordan, specifically investigating whether ventures' survival was affected by the source of their initial funding. The results show that ventures that received their initial funding from family were less likely to survive than those that received their initial funding from banks when significant numbers of refugees entered Jordan. Our paper suggests that this difference may be due to how the guiding principles of firms shaped decisions around resource allocation and strategic adaptation. For entrepreneurs and investors, this suggests that the source of a venture's initial funding can be a hidden strength or vulnerability, depending on the social and economic disruptions it faces.</content>

    <title>Air pollution and managers’ forecasting ability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between U.S. managers’ short-term exposure to air pollution and their forecasting ability. We focus on air pollution due to PM2.5, a fine particulate matter that can easily penetrate an indoor, climate-controlled environment. We show that the short-term ambient PM2.5level at the firm’s headquarters before a management earnings forecast issuance is negatively associated with the accuracy of the forecast. Also, the short-term ambient PM2.5level before an earnings announcement is negatively related to the likelihood of a concurrent management forecast issuance. These relations occur at PM2.5levels below the U.S. air quality standard. A battery of additional tests validate these findings. These results suggest that a transitory exposure to PM2.5at levels common in the United States temporarily decreases managers’ forecasting ability. The temporary cognitive impairment from short-term exposure to modest levels of PM2.5, as documented in epidemiological studies, is presumably the reason.</content>

    <title>Improving Cystic Fibrosis Screening Through a Novel Testing Design</title>
    <updated>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newborn screening (NBS) plays a key role in detecting life-threatening genetic disorders, with cystic fibrosis (CF) being a prominent example. Having CF requires both copies of the CFTR gene (one inherited from each parent) to be pathogenic variants. With over 1,000 CF-causing variant types, a genetic test that can detect enough variant types for sufficient screening accuracy is expensive and capacity-constrained. Consequently, in the US, the first tier of testing uses an inexpensive biochemical test that measures immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, which are often elevated in CF cases. Genetic testing is reserved for a small fraction of newborns with elevated IRT levels, based on an IRT threshold. However, setting an optimal IRT threshold that balances sensitivity with overall screening cost and genetic testing capacity is challenging, which is exacerbated by variations in IRT levels and CF prevalences among different racial/ethnic groups. As a result, the current practice of using a single IRT threshold for all newborns is not necessarily the most efficient or equitable strategy.
            
            This paper introduces a novel screening design that integrates an inexpensive small-panel genetic test with an IRT test in the first tier of testing. This strategy customizes IRT thresholds based on the number of variants detected by the small-panel genetic test. This design leads to novel optimization problems, including variant type selection for the small-panel genetic test and IRT threshold customization. We establish key structural properties of optimal IRT thresholds and develop Pareto frontiers that inform decision-makers about the efficiency versus equity trade-off, considering a specific minimax type equity measure. The case study, utilizing CF NBS data from the states of New York and California, demonstrates the potential efficiency and equity gains of this novel approach compared to current practice and race-based benchmarks. This research offers valuable insights and methodologies for improving CF NBS processes, and has implications for public policy decision-making.</content>

    <title>Rate-Optimal Online Learning for Dynamic Assortment Selection with Positioning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study addresses a key challenge in online retail: product positioning. The authors propose a novel online learning framework called dynamic assortment selection with positioning (DAP). Unlike traditional models that focus solely on item selection, DAP also learns optimal product placement to maximize revenue. The researchers model customer choices using a multinomial logit framework, where item appeal depends on both intrinsic preference and display position. They demonstrate that ignoring position effects leads to suboptimal performance and introduce a new algorithm, TLR-UCB, which effectively incorporates adaptive position-dependent feedback through a geometric linear bandit structure and truncated linear regression techniques. Theoretical analysis confirms that TLR-UCB achieves optimal learning efficiency. To handle unknown position effects, they further develop EI-TLR, a two-stage policy that jointly estimates customer preferences and positioning impacts before applying a generalized TLR-UCB procedure. Extensive simulations show that both TLR-UCB and EI-TLR significantly outperform existing benchmarks, offering powerful tools for dynamic, data-driven assortment and layout optimization in online marketplaces.</content>

    <title>Performance Ranks, Conformity, and Cooperation: Evidence from a Sweater Factory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Performance ranking can trigger multiple social incentives for workers. On one hand, it offers status rewards to induce them to increase effort. On the other, better-ranked workers may reduce effort to conform to coworkers’ productivity in fear of social retribution. This paper uses a field experiment in a sweater factory to disentangle the incentives underlying performance ranks. Treated workers receive ranks either privately or publicly. I find that private ranks do not have any effect on average but that public ranks reduce worker productivity. Additional evidence confirms that productivity declines because of workers’ social concerns and their desire to conform to the productivity of their friends. Cooperation between workers decreases too but with limited effect on productivity. The paper illustrates how inducing worker competition may be counterproductive for firms.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Financial support from the Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries, Centre for Economic Policy Research [PEDL ERG 4362] and the DFG through CRC TRR 190 [Project 280092119] are gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01381 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The estimation of loss distributions for dynamic portfolios requires the simulation of scenarios representing realistic joint dynamics of their components. We propose a novel data-driven approach for simulating realistic, high-dimensional multiasset scenarios, focusing on accurately representing tail risk for a class of static and dynamic trading strategies. We exploit the joint elicitability property of Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall to design a Generative Adversarial Network that learns to simulate price scenarios preserving these tail risk features. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on synthetic and market data sets through detailed numerical experiments. In contrast to previously proposed data-driven scenario generators, our proposed method correctly captures tail risk for a broad class of trading strategies and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. In addition, combining our method with principal component analysis of the input data enhances its scalability to large-dimensional multiasset time series, setting our framework apart from the univariate settings commonly considered in the literature.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00936 .</content>

    <title>Boosting Sales and Customer Welfare from Premade Foods (Let the Freshest Chicken Fly off the Shelf First)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines a grocery retailer’s management of a premade food product. The retailer’s goal is to maximize a weighted sum of direct profit and customer welfare. Multiple items of the product are produced in batches and immediately displayed for sale. Considering that each item’s quality decreases while it sits on the shelf, the retailer chooses the shelf life, whether to issue items in first-in-first-out (FIFO) or last-in-first-out (LIFO) order, whether to timestamp items, and how to price items. In a base model, we find that the retailer should use LIFO issuance and not timestamp items. The intuition is that this increases customer welfare and allows for a longer shelf life, increasing sales and thus reducing waste. By extending the model, we identify features that can make FIFO optimal (such as a holding cost, upper bound on the shelf life, age-dependent disposal cost, or customer risk or loss aversion), and we show how customer heterogeneity can favor timestamps. Lastly, we show how a mandate to donate unsold food items (as implemented in France and California) can motivate a retailer to increase the shelf life, thereby reducing the quality and quantity of donated items.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01246 .</content>

    <title>Trade-Offs in Leveraging External Data Capabilities: Evidence from a Field Experiment in an Online Search Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly leverage external entities’ data capabilities to unlock improvements in their offerings, but measuring the impact of such capabilities is challenging. Collaborating with the search team at a technology company, we analyzed a large-scale field experiment in which we randomized access to an external, leading search engine’s autocomplete application programming interface (API) for more than two million users over 108 days. We measure the causal effects of removing API access on two performance metrics of the focal company’s search product: (a) clickthrough rate (CTR) on search suggestions and (b) CTR on the search engine results page. We find that, on average, compared with the baseline with API access, removing API access reduces the search suggestion CTR by 4.6%. Further, exploiting the experimental variation, we use an instrumental variables approach to establish that a 10% increase (decrease) in CTR on search suggestions leads to a 1.85% increase (decrease) in CTR on top-slot search results. However, the negative effect of removing API access becomes less negative over time with the effect magnitude in the longer term being half what we would have obtained with a short-term experiment. We provide suggestive mechanism evidence of the longer term effect: the focal company’s reliance on the leading search engine’s data capability tapers off the accumulation of internal data and then limits the improvement of its autocomplete predictions. This research informs managers of a critical trade-off in leveraging external data capabilities and sheds light on regulations, such as the Digital Markets Act, that mandate data sharing by large digital platforms.This paper was accepted by DJ Wu, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72442015, 72171132, and 72171146] and the China Scholarship Council [Grant 202206230110].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01834 .</content>

    <title>Economic Substance Behind Texas Political Anti-ESG Sanctions</title>
    <updated>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A stark contrast exists between the stated preferences of politicians in the so-called blue states (Democrats) and those in red states (Republicans) on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. We examine whether these polarized political stances are reflected in the investment strategies of respective states’ pension funds. We examine a Texas directive that the state agencies divest from investment companies that profess a pro-ESG stance and allegedly “boycott” energy stocks. We find that funds banned by the Texas directive, despite carrying ESG-focused titles, are largely indexers with a tilt slightly away from energy stocks and slightly toward technology stocks. Banning such funds would make little difference to Texas pensioners or Texas energy companies, because the returns and stock holdings of banned funds are not meaningfully different from those of size-matched funds that do not proclaim an ESG focus. Pension funds in red states do not act per their politicians’ stance and largely follow market trends in their investment strategies. They have similar exposures to technology and energy stocks, as do pension funds in blue states. We conclude that the vehement pro– and anti–fossil fuel proclamations of blue and red states’ politicians, respectively, are not observed in their own state pension funds’ investment policies over which politicians have better control than on external funds.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

    <title>EXPRESS: Healthy Relationships and Healthy Eating: How Stressful Events and Social Support Affect Indulgence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how acute stress and social support jointly influence indulgent food decision making using lab experiments and a unique combination of large-scale datasets. Our experiments reveal that social support moderates the effect of stress on indulgent food choices, with individuals with lower support more likely to indulge under stress. We argue that this occurs because social support provides psychological resources that help individuals regulate their behavior under stress. Using a process-by-moderation approach, we demonstrate that providing contextual support, enhancing perceived control, and promoting deliberative thinking attenuate the effect of low social support on indulgent behavior under stress. At a broader level, we test these predictions by analyzing the impact of Hurricane Sandy, an exogenous stressor, on indulgent food purchases. A Difference-in-Difference (DiD) analysis in a natural experiment reveals that while Sandy-affected areas experienced a significant rise in indulgent food sales, this increase was attenuated in communities with higher social support, suggesting that the availability of social resources plays a critical role in moderating stress-driven consumption. Together, our research highlights how social support shapes stress-induced consumption patterns and identifies novel factors that affect indulgent food choices on a real-world and large-scale basis.</content>

    <title>Optimal Portfolio Choice with Fat Tails and Parameter Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing portfolio combination rules that optimize the out-of-sample performance under parameter uncertainty assume multivariate normally distributed returns. However, we show that this assumption is not innocuous because fat tails in returns lead to poorer out-of-sample performance of the sample mean–variance and sample global minimum-variance (GMV) portfolios relative to normality. Consequently, when returns are fat-tailed, portfolio combination rules should allocate less to the sample mean–variance and sample GMV portfolios, and more to the risk-free asset, than the normality assumption prescribes. Empirical evidence shows that accounting for fat tails in the construction of optimal portfolio combination rules significantly improves their out-of-sample performance.</content>

    <title>The right to decide: A decision‐based perspective on corporate stakeholder governance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complications arise when stakeholders with heterogeneous and potentially misaligned preferences are considered in corporate decisions. This paper examines how high‐level decision‐making corporate forums, such as boards, can address such heterogeneous claims. We identify three corporate stakeholder governance types depending on the externalities that they generate (which can consider the contributing stakeholders or encompass a broader set of stakeholders affected by the company's operations) and, based on three critical governance attributes (allocation of control rights, corporate objectives, and deliberation mechanisms), identify governance structures that generate benefits to the targeted stakeholders (based on the generated externalities) at a lower governance cost. We also propose that structures managing broad externalities facilitate problem formulation (besides solving) and more effectively deal with contexts involving ill‐defined problems.Managerial SummaryIn the corporate governance of for‐profit firms, there have been calls to consider the demands of multiple stakeholders and even engage them in the decision‐making process. However, dealing with multiple stakeholders is costly; their perspectives often differ markedly, creating conflict and risking impasse. Focusing on three critical attributes of boards (decision rights, corporate objective, and decision‐making mechanisms), we identify three main types of stakeholder‐oriented corporate governance structures that increasingly broaden the set of stakeholders considered while keeping decision‐making costs manageable. We argue that structures accommodating broader stakeholder interests, although costly, are relatively more effective when board members face problems that are difficult to characterize and that may require different opinions and perspectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive overview of accounting-related regulatory changes (financial accounting, auditing, tax, and other disclosures) in the 27 European Union countries and the United Kingdom since 1993 based on an extensive literature review, survey, and topic and country expert input. Across all countries and years, we find that more than 16 regulatory events occur in a typical difference-in-differences research design that includes pre- and post-periods of four years. On average 3.4 out of four accounting disciplines are affected, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary awareness. Our accompanying website (http://www.eu-regulations.com) offers visual representations of these events, regulation summaries, literature links, and source documents, all by country. This work aims to (1) lower the cost for researchers, reviewers, and editors to understand the EU’s evolving regulatory landscape; (2) improve research designs by identifying concurrent regulatory events; and (3) highlight research opportunities for those studying the EU or specific member states.</content>

    <title>Situational Support for Corruption: A Two-Part Field Experiment on Collusive vs. Extortive Bribery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reports a two-part field experiment study that demonstrates that negative externality primes commonly used in anticorruption campaigns and academic research on collusive corruption are more effective in reducing participation in corruption among the minority of people who already reject the private-public trade-off inherent in collusive corruption than they are in changing the behavior of those who are tolerant of it. Using a random sample of 1,403 residents of Nairobi County, Kenya, we first administered an in-person vignette experiment that measures respondents’ attitudes regarding collusive bribes compared with more coercive types. Collusive bribes are judged more acceptable across multiple outcome measures because they provide the greatest private benefits, but collusive bribes are also rated as the most unethical and at least as harmful to public goods as coercive payments. Several days later, we administered a behavioral experiment to the same respondents, which provided an opportunity to collude with a corrupt representative of the research team to receive illicit additional compensation for participating in the study. A negative externality prime was effective in reducing acceptance of the corrupt opportunity among respondents who rejected the trade-off between self-interested benefits and harming public goods in the vignette experiment. A concluding discussion addresses the high overall acceptance rate of the collusive offer and suggests directions for future interventions. Lastly, we generalize our results to a middle-range theory of organizational misconduct involving transactions between corrupt agents and the public.Funding: This work was supported by the University of South Carolina Sonoco International Business Department’s Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) [Grant P220A220013-23], received from the U.S. Department of Education.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.18659 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the consequences of an intrusive debt-collection tactic that targets delinquent borrowers’ social circles. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that some of the delinquent loans are not worked on because of collection agents’ excessive workload. Using two approaches to estimate the local treatment effect, we show that this social-shaming tactic backfires and substantially increases the borrowers’ default rate. Borrowers with better outside options for credit access and male borrowers respond more strongly after they are shamed socially. These findings are in general consistent with the negative reciprocity interpretation; angered borrowers retaliate by defaulting on their loans.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00681 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When organizations adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize individuals’ negative emotions and accordingly allocate limited resources, strategic users are incentivized to game the system by misrepresenting their emotions. The value of AI in automating such emotion-driven allocation may be undermined by gaming behavior, algorithmic noise in emotion detection, and the spillover effect of negative emotions. We develop a game-theoretical model to understand emotion AI adoption, particularly in customer care, and analyze the design of the associated allocation policies. We find that adopting emotion AI is valuable if the spillover effect of negative emotions is negligible compared with resource misallocation loss, regardless of algorithmic noise and gaming behavior. We also quantify the welfare impacts of emotion AI on the users, organization, and society. Notably, a stronger AI is not always socially desirable and regulation on emotion-driven allocation is needed. Finally, we characterize conditions under which leveraging the AI system is preferred to hiring human employees in emotion-driven allocation. We also explore the alternative application of using emotion AI to monitor strategic employees and compare it with hiring a human manager for monitoring. Intriguingly, algorithmic noise may increase the profit of AI monitoring. Our work provides implications for designing, adopting, and regulating emotion AI.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit staggered releases of satellite data on parking lot traffic across U.S. retailers and conduct the stacked Poisson regression to identify the causal effect of big data availability on corporate voluntary disclosure. We document a significant decrease in management good news forecasts following the satellite data release, whereas bad news forecasts are unaffected. The asymmetric decrease cannot be explained by the demand-side substitution hypothesis. Our evidence suggests that the supply-side “meeting guidance” hypothesis is likely to account for the disappearing good news forecasts. We also derive cross-sectional predictions from the hypothesis and confirm them in the data: The decrease in good news forecasts is more pronounced among short-horizon quarterly guidance than long-term forecasts and when firms have higher institutional ownership, higher operating uncertainty, and higher litigation risk of missing guidance.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: S.

    <title>Entrepreneurial Fundraising Strategies and the Gender Gap: Theory and Evidence from Equity Crowdfunding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Start-ups with female founders typically raise less money than their male counterparts. Prior literature explores investor demand and finds evidence of assortative matching, where investors prefer to invest in entrepreneurs of their own gender. In the context of equity crowdfunding, we examine the supply side of the gender funding gap, asking how female and male founders anticipate different investor demand. We develop an assortative matching theory that generates four benchmark predictions, namely that female founders (i) ask for less funding, (ii) have the same campaign success probability, (iii) receive less funding if successful, and (iv) have the same overfunding ratio, defined as the ratio of funding received over funding requested. Leveraging proprietary data from a UK equity crowdfunding platform that includes both successful and unsuccessful ventures, the evidence matches the first three predictions, also finding that all-female teams have larger funding gaps than mixed-gender teams. For the overfunding ratio, we find that mixed-gender (all-female) teams have higher (lower) overfunding ratios than the all-male benchmark. We also find that female investors fund mixed-gender teams relatively more, whereas male investors give disproportionately less to all-female teams. Gender gaps increase for more capital-intensive ventures.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Said Business School, University of Oxford [John Fell Fund] and the Coller Institute of Venture at Tel Aviv University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06658 .</content>

    <title>Evaluating the Effect of Soda Taxes Using a Dynamic Model of Rational Addiction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The obesity rate has grown to epidemic proportions in the United States. Recent scientific studies suggest that excess intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is one of the primary contributors to weight gain. One option to address the growing obesity epidemic is to discourage SSB consumption through fiscal policies such as imposing a soda excise tax. In this paper, we apply the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction to present evidence that consumers are rationally addicted to the consumption of soda drinks that contain caffeine and/or sugar. Motivated by the evidence, we build a dynamic structural model to quantify the impact of soda taxes on soda purchases and consumption and study the role of addiction in influencing this impact. We extend the canonical rational addiction model by introducing a multidimensional framework of addiction, which allows for the decomposition of addiction in the context of soda consumption into two distinct components: caffeine and sugar. Using the parameter estimates, we conduct counterfactual analyses based on realistic policy scenarios and evaluate how different tax policies would affect soda purchases. For example, one policy experiment indicates that a tax of one cent per ounce only on sugary soda categories would lead to a 50.2% decrease in sugary soda consumption. In addition, we find that sugar seems to play a bigger role in influencing substitution patterns than caffeine. We further investigate how these taxes affect welfare through a change in addiction level and emphasize the importance of addiction by comparing estimation results with and without addiction in the model. To understand the externalities associated with soda taxation, we integrate our counterfactual results with causal estimates from recent medical literature. Our findings suggest that individuals could decrease their medical costs by $642 to $717 per year under various tax schemes. These results underscore the potential of soda taxes to significantly improve public health and reduce obesity-related healthcare costs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by a Nanyang Technological University start-up grant [Grant 023220-00001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02422 .</content>

    <title>Dynamic Pricing for Two-Sided Marketplaces with Offer Expiration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a two-sided marketplace in which a market operator sells services to clients and buys services from vendors. The market operator determines the prices dynamically for both clients and vendors. Services are transacted in discrete units called jobs, and the jobs are characterized by their types, service deadlines, client prices, and vendor prices. Jobs are submitted by clients to the marketplace, and the market operator then lists the available jobs. Vendors can view the available jobs and choose them based on their preferences. We consider an infinite-horizon long-run average reward Markov decision process (MDP) model of the market operator’s dynamic pricing problem. The MDP consists of the arrival processes on both sides of the marketplace as well as the choice behavior of both clients and vendors. Because solving this MDP directly is impractical for large market sizes, we study a discrete-time fluid approximation of the problem. This approximation results in a simple pricing policy in which each job’s price trajectory depends on the time remaining until the service deadline but does not depend on the other jobs available in the marketplace. We show that this policy is asymptotically optimal with a loss ratio of order [Formula: see text] on the long-run average reward, where [Formula: see text] represents the scale of demand and supply. The performance of the fixed price trajectory policy is compared with other heuristics, including a constant pricing policy and a state-dependent pricing policy. We also extend the model to continuous-time and finite-horizon settings.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: The work of Y.

    <title>Scaling Emerging Healthcare Technology: Managing Paradoxical Tensions in A Connected Health Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To address growing geographical disparities in healthcare access and quality, connected health platforms (CHPs) have emerged as promising solutions. However, rapidly scaling CHPs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing tensions among multiple entities. This study examines the digital scaling process of a CHP through the lens of paradox theory, focusing on tensions and their management in resource‐constrained environments. We conducted a 13‐year longitudinal case study of a CHP encompassing over 300 hospitals in China. Our findings reveal three distinct yet interconnected phases of digital scaling: digital foundation building; system integration and governance; and continuous improvement and innovation. We demonstrate that tensions evolve over time during the scaling process, with one dominant type prevailing in each phase, challenging previous assumptions that different tensions emerge simultaneously across multiple entities. We also identify phase‐specific “both‐and” responses employed by rural hospitals to manage tensions despite experiencing resource constraints. We provide guidance to organizations operating in resource‐constrained environments on the management of paradoxical tensions across a complex digital scaling process.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using account‐level data on millions of U.S. middle‐class investors over 2006 to 2018, we characterize the share of investable wealth that they hold in the stock market over their working lives. Relative to the 1990s, this share has both risen by 10% and become age‐dependent. The Pension Protection Act (PPA)—which allowed target date funds (TDFs) to be default options in retirement plans—played an important role: younger (older) workers starting at a firm after TDFs became the default option post‐PPA invested more (less) in stocks, in line with the TDF glidepath. In contrast, contribution rates changed little following the PPA.</content>

    <title>Do Shared Auditors Facilitate Follow‐on Innovation?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether shared auditors promote the dissemination of innovative knowledge among their clients, thereby fostering follow‐on innovation. We find that a company cites more patents from another company when they are audited by the same audit office. To address concerns about potential confounding factors stemming from commonalities in the fundamentals of the two companies, we leverage a quasi‐exogenous shock to auditor sharing: the demise of Arthur Andersen and the subsequent increase in auditor switching in 2002. Further analysis reveals that the effect of a shared auditor on cross‐client patent citations is stronger when both clients engage in intensive innovation activities. Additional evidence suggests that shared auditors exert more influence on the citations of recent patents and patents that are easier for outsiders to utilize. Overall, our findings suggest that auditors affect corporate innovation by facilitating the transfer of innovative knowledge among their clients.</content>

    <title>That's Not What I Was Promised! Psychological Contracts and Quiet Quitting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The phrase “quiet quitting” has become a popular topic within the workplace and academia. However, the nomological network of quiet quitting is unclear. We contribute to quiet quitting research by incorporating organizational justice and job characteristics theories with a psychological contract and social exchange lens to illuminate antecedents and outcomes of quiet quitting. Prior to doing so, we address the conceptual and measurement challenges that threaten the knowledge accumulation of quiet quitting research. Using a qualitative study (N= 42) and prior research, we disentangle quiet quitting from its antecedents and outcomes to define it asintentionally performing to the minimum requirements of the job. We then develop a measure of quiet quitting across a subject matter expert review (N= 51), a naïve rater review (N= 90), and an assessment of the measure's psychometric properties (N= 198). Finally, we assess our conceptual model (N= 540) and find that psychological contract fulfillment has a negative indirect effect on quiet quitting through job satisfaction. Furthermore, psychological contract breach increases quiet quitting through job satisfaction. We find that quiet quitting subsequently increases CWBs and decreases OCBs. Our findings point toward an optimistic outlook: by accurately communicating expectations regarding organizational justice and job characteristics, human resource managers may be able to limit the prevalence of quiet quitting and subsequent detrimental behaviors within their organizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the performance of advisors’ recommendations influence investors’ propensity to seek advice again? I investigate a sample of calls between 10,063 German brokerage clients and financial advisors from 2005–2015. If advisors’ recommendations in the initial meeting led to positive (vs. negative) performance, investors are 2.1 times more likely to arrange a second meeting. This effect is driven by the performance of the recommendations the investor decided to follow. Investors with positive performance follow recommendations to a greater degree. The findings show that experiences matter in the advisory context and shape the demand for advice. (JEL D14; G11; G40; G51)</content>

    <title>Traditional Institutions in Modern Times: Dowries as Pensions When Sons Migrate</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses newly-collected data on the allocation of dowry to examine its role in resolving intergenerational frictions around migration in India. Migration disrupts traditional elderly support structures, in which sons live near their parents and care for them in old age. We develop a model in which dowry can promote migration by allowing sons to make upfront transfers to their parents and ease constraints on income sharing. To test this hypothesis, we collect two new datasets that measure the distribution of dowry between family members. We document for the first time that net transfers of dowry to a man’s parents are common but far from universal. Consistent with using dowry for income sharing, such transfers occur more often when sons migrate, especially when they work in higher-earning occupations. In nationally representative data, migration rates are higher in areas with stronger historical dowry traditions. Finally, exploiting a large-scale highway construction program, we show that men from areas with stronger historical dowry traditions migrate more when migration costs fall. Our findings provide some clues as to why dowry persists despite its well-documented adverse consequences.</content>

    <title>Aggregation and the Estimation of Quality Change: Application to U.S. Import Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize the contribution of changes in quality, price, and variety entry/exit to the aggregate price index for smooth, invertible demand systems, generalizing the standard results derived in the CES case. The results require the knowledge of heterogeneous cross-product elasticities of substitution. To apply them in practice, we also show how to identify rich demand systems using data only on prices and market shares, without the need for external cost-shock instruments or strong assumptions on the covariance between supply and demand shocks. Using this approach, we compute the US import price index based on the Kimball demand system. We find that quality change on average lowered the inflation in import prices by around 0.007 log points annually (1989–2016). To further validate our approach, we show that it estimates price elasticities and quality changes similar to those found by the standard mixed logit (BLP) demand in data on the US auto market.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impacts of Strategic Consumers and Direct Channel on Supply Chain Contracting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impacts of strategic consumers and direct channel on the manufacturer’s choice between static and dynamic contracts. We consider two scenarios: one in which the manufacturer sells through a single retailer, and the other in which it sells through two different retailers sequentially. In each scenario, the retailer(s) sets the retail prices, which the manufacturer’s direct channel matches, while consumers may time their purchases. We derive the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We find that in the first scenario, the static wholesale contract is preferred if the market share of the direct channel is large, as it alleviates strategic consumer waiting. This is most effective when consumers are moderately strategic. In the second scenario, intertemporal competition arises between the two retailers, which may not only reduce supply chain friction but also counteract strategic waiting. As a result, the equilibrium changes structurally. The dynamic wholesale contract is preferred when consumers are not very strategic, and the direct channel no longer plays a significant role. Several extensions of our main setting are explored. Our findings provide practical insights into how an upstream firm can effectively manage its retail channel in the presence of a direct channel and strategic consumers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Influence of Power on Trust in Buyer−Supplier Relationships: An Actor−Partner Interdependence Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trust is among the most critical factors in buyer−supplier relationships. In an effort to understand the origins of trust, power has become the focus of a burgeoning body of literature. However, research on the association between power and trust has been plagued by inconsistencies in terms of whose power and trust are being examined, which has led to confusion and hindered cumulative progress. We address this issue by disentangling the effect of the focal organization (actor effect) from the effect specific to its partner (partner effect) and accounting for both simultaneously. We further theorize and show that the partner’s level of self-promotion communication about his or her own achievements and credentials moderates both actor and partner effects, thus adding knowledge about a contingency that accounts for a considerable degree of variation in the linkage between power and trust. Using multi-informant, dyadic survey data paired with archival information scraped from firms’ webpages, we find that (i) actors low (vs. high) in power tend to place more trust (ii) while simultaneously eliciting higher levels of trust from their partners; however, (iii) these effects differ markedly depending on the partner’s level of self-promotion communication. Our study offers a novel, integrative perspective on power and trust, and we elaborate on its important implications for understanding buyer−supplier relationships.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the dynamics of a two-sided platform, where the agent population on both sides experiences growth over time with heterogeneous growth rates. The compatibility between buyers and sellers is captured by a bipartite network. The platform sets commissions to optimize its total profit overTperiods, considering the trade-off between short-term profit and growth as well as the spatial imbalances in supply and demand. We design an asymptotically optimal policy with the profit loss upper-bounded by a constant independent ofT, in contrast with a myopic policy shown to be arbitrarily bad. To derive the policy, we first develop a benchmark problem that captures the platform’s optimal steady state. We then identify the agent types with the lowest relative population ratio compared to the benchmark in each period, and adjust the service level of these types to be higher than or equal to their service level in the benchmark problem. A higher service level accelerates growth but requires substantial subsidies during the growth phase. Additionally, we provide the conditions under which the subsidy is necessary. We further examine the impact of the growth potential and the compatibility network structure on the platform’s optimal profit, the agents’ payment/income, and the optimal commissions at the optimal steady state. To achieve that, we introduce innovative metrics to quantify the long-run growth potential of each agent type. Using these metrics, we show that a “balanced” compatibility network, where the relative long-run growth potential between sellers and buyers for all submarkets is the same as that for the entire market, allows the platform to achieve maximum profitability. Our study provides insight into how the growth potential and compatibility network structure jointly influence the commission policy in the growth process and the optimal steady state.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether individuals form extrapolative beliefs across different tasks. In line with cross-extrapolation, equity analysts who experience bad news from some of their coverage firms become overly pessimistic about other firms in their coverage. This leads to disagreement among analysts and has implications for the stock market, as we observe effects on trading volume, return volatility, and pricing. Our findings highlight the relevance of non-domain-specific belief models.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04903 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how access to debt markets affects firms’ incentives to provide trade credit. Using hand-collected trade credit data between customer-supplier pairs and two exogenous shocks to firms’ debt capacity, we show that better access to debt reduces firms’ provision of trade credit per dollar of sales. The decline in trade credit is concentrated on ex ante powerful customers, but absent for weak ones, suggesting that better access to debt improves firms’ bargaining position relative to powerful customers. The decline in trade credit leads customers to cut investment, increase leverage, and scale back trade credit provision to firms further downstream.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04090 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: DICE: Advancing Social Media Research through Digital In-Context Experiments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article introduces Digital In-Context Experiments (DICE), an experimental paradigm that enables researchers to study entire social media feeds while tracking users’ granular behavioral data at the post level. Current research paradigms (vignette-based experiments, online platform studies, and observational studies) predominantly focus on isolated social media posts without examining how users consume content within the broader context of a feed. This isolation overlooks the competing attention between content (e.g., sponsored posts or ads) within a feed and contextual spillovers that occur when users scroll through continuous streams of content. DICE complements existing paradigms by presenting posts withinscrollable feeds, more closely resembling how users experience content on social media. This allows researchers to systematically manipulate entire feed compositions while unobtrusively tracking participants’ scrolling behavior. To demonstrate the potential of DICE, the article presents two illustrative case studies that examine contextual spillovers and predict ad recall in environments where content competes for attention. The authors conclude with directions for future research and managerial perspectives derived from expert interviews with marketing professionals. An accompanying open-source app, available athttps://dice-app.org, enables researchers to conveniently integrate the experimental paradigm into their preferred workflow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Article Title: “The ITEM Ontology: A Tool to Elucidate the Anatomy of Psychometric Indicators”Authors:Kai R. Larsen, University of Colorado BoulderRoland M. Mueller, Berlin School of Economics and LawDario Bonaretti, NEOMA Business SchoolDiana Fischer-Preßler, University of Applied Sciences FrankfurtJames (Jim) Burleson, California Polytechnic State UniversityNimisha Singh, Bennett University, IndiaJeffrey Parsons, Memorial University of NewfoundlandJean-Charles Pillet, Toulouse Business SchoolLan Sang, University of Colorado BoulderZhu (Drew) Zhang, University of Rhode IslandProblem definition:For decades, scientists have treated the survey item as the atomic unit of psychological measurement, an indivisible entity to be validated primarily through statistics. But what if we have been looking at the wrong level of analysis? Despite sophisticated modeling techniques, even well-validated instruments often contain items that are vague, double-barreled, or semantically misaligned with their intended constructs. These flaws remain undetected because current methods ignore the semantic anatomy of items. There is no shared language for decomposing indicators into the elements that carry meaning.Relevance:We show that psychometric measurement cannot be understood at the item or construct level and, for the first time, demonstrate that problems such as double-barreled items, restriction of range, and double negation can now be operationally defined and automatically detected. We argue that without tools like the ITEM Ontology, psychological measurement will never be precise enough to match the precision required for tasks such as medication optimization, leadership evaluation, technology impact assessment, and political polling.Theoretical foundations: This paper advances a new theory of survey indicator design by proposing that indicators can—and should—be deconstructed into meaningful components such as objects, actions, attributes, qualifiers, and response formats. This component-level analysis reveals structural and semantic flaws that traditional psychometric techniques often miss. Although grounded in linguistic and cognitive theory, our framework also draws on principles from established ontologies, particularly DOLCE, to ensure conceptual rigor and consistency. By making the internal anatomy of indicators explicit, the approach offers a foundational shift in how we understand, evaluate, and improve survey-based measurement.Methodology: We used design science methodologies to develop, refine, and test the ontology.Results: In addition to the ITEM ontology, we also provide a website ( http://www.itemontology.org/ ) that enables researchers to code indicators within the ontology, along with the ITEMIZER tool, which highlights potential wording issues and construct validity concerns associated with coded indicators.Contributions: This paper enables researchers and survey writers to understand the underlying components and their relationships within and across survey indicators. With the ITEM ontology, not only can we enhance the quality of future surveys, but we also provide a language to discuss how indicators are written and how they can be improved. We demonstrate the value of the ITEM Ontology by presenting two use cases for evaluating item quality and validating content.Keywords: ontology, psychometrics, indicator evaluation, validity, scale developmentProblem definition: What is your research problem/question in simple terms?Relevance: Why is this problem relevant for research and/or practice?Theoretical foundations: What theory (theories) underlie this work (if applicable)?Methodology: What is the research approach used (if applicable)?

    <title>When AI Becomes an Agent of the Firm: Examining the Evolution of AI in Organizations Through an Agency Theory Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our work begins with the premise that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into firm decision making parallels the emergence of the professional manager, which prompted the birth of agency theory. We examine the evolution of AI through an agency theory lens, considering how the nature of firm control and decision rights change as AI evolves. While AI will initially mimic human routines, we theorize a point at which the AI system will achieve a level of autonomy and self‐determination to be considered an agent of the firm. How, then, can we align an agent with the fate of the firm, when that agent is no longer a human? To address this, we integrate agency theory with a model of AI evolution, demonstrating that conflict between an AI agent and the firm will require a reconsideration of agency mechanisms if agent‐principal alignment is to be achieved. We theorize specific forms of monitoring and incentive alignment that serve to align an AI agent with the firm's interests, thus extending agency mechanisms in the context of AI. Our theoretical exercise offers important implications for scholarship at the intersection of AI and organizational theory, as well as considerations for practice and policy.</content>

    <title>The &lt;scp&gt;ABCs&lt;/scp&gt; of Quiet Quitting: A Bifurcated Framework of Its Passive and Deliberate Types</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our multi‐study, mixed‐methods research introduces a novel framework of quiet quitting and distinguishes it from related constructs in the human resources and organizational behavior literature. Studies 1 and 2 employ topic modeling of social and news media data and qualitative content analysis of in‐depth interviews with self‐identified quiet quitters, respectively, to examine how social media users, journalists, and quiet quitters define quiet quitting and describe its antecedents and consequences. Drawing on Kahn's framework of disengagement, we develop a bifurcated framework of quiet quitting comprising passive and deliberate types, each with distinct affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions. Study 3 uses a quasi‐Q‐sort methodology to compare passive and deliberate quiet quitting with existing human resources and organizational behavior constructs and reveals that quiet quitting is a novel concept, with its passive and deliberate types being distinct from nomologically related constructs. Our bifurcated framework makes valuable theoretical contributions and offers nuanced practical implications for organizations, establishing a solid foundation for future research to treat quiet quitting as a discrete phenomenon, moving the conversation beyond debating its academic relevance.</content>

    <title>Employee Age and the Work–Family Interface: A Meta‐Analysis and Framework Integrating Life Span and Life Course Perspectives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on the relationship between age and the work–family interface (WFI) is critical to effective human resource management. Yet, findings remain inconsistent and lack theoretical integration. We conducted a meta‐analysis (k= 256,n= 186,109) integrating lifespan and life course perspectives to develop a model of the relationship between age and the WFI. Drawing on socio‐emotional selectivity theory (SEST), a prevalent lifespan approach, results reveal a significant linear relationship between age and the WFI, with variation contingent on the construct and directionality. Age was negatively associated with work‐to‐family conflict, family‐to‐work conflict, and family‐to‐work enrichment, and positively associated with work‐to‐family enrichment and work–family balance. We integrated a life course view to examine how personal (gender, race, age cohort), situational (job, marital status), and contextual (national, global) factors moderate these relationships. Declines in work‐to‐family conflict with age occurred for men but not women, suggesting a widening gender gap for older compared to younger workers. The negative association between age and work‐to‐family conflict was stronger than for family‐to‐work conflict among older adults (over age 50 cohort) and professionals. Younger adult workers under 30 reported significant work‐to‐family conflict. The relationship between age and the WFI was significantly moderated by national (U.S., Non‐U.S.) and global (Global North, Global South) contexts, with the strength of age‐related patterns in work–family conflict varying by gender and job status. Our results highlight that future HRM studies and organizational practice should focus on advancing age‐inclusive policies to better address the increasingly varied age and work–family relationships across many employee subgroups.</content>

    <title>When Managers Stay, Workers Are Safer: Rethinking the Value of Firm-Specific Human Capital</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A commonly held assumption is that firm-specific human capital benefits firms while constraining employees, particularly by reducing their external mobility. While this tension holds in many contexts, it overlooks the possibility that firm-specific human capital developed by one group of employees—managers—can generate positive externalities for others. Using a novel empirical setting and a 16-year panel of 19,044 establishments with 107,309 establishment-year observations, we find that an increase in managers’ firm-specific human capital is associated with improvements in workplace safety. These effects are especially pronounced in organizations with weak safety orientations and with higher proportions of lower-skill employees, who are typically more vulnerable to safety risks. Our findings reveal a previously underexplored channel through which firm-specific human capital creates value: by enabling managers to protect other employees. This challenges the prevailing view that firm-specific human capital primarily serves firm interests and highlights a broader set of beneficiaries—offering a new perspective on the role of managers’ firm-specific human capital in shaping organizational outcomes.</content>

    <title>Is Everyone Having a Good Time? The Effects of Complex Organizational Rituals on Employee Engagement and Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The organizational rituals literature has primarily focused on simple rituals and their positive effects on participants. While generative, this focus has obscured the intricacy and potential downsides of complex rituals, such as workplace celebrations and team-building retreats. In our research, we leverage Interaction Rituals Theory (IRT) to broaden the theoretical foundation of the study of organizational rituals by examining the range of experiences that employees have within complex organizational rituals. First, we inductively identify the positive and negative experiences within complex organizational rituals and create scales to measure them. Next, drawing further from IRT, we develop a model explaining how these experiences affect employee engagement and identify the subsequent work behaviors most likely to be affected by ritual-induced changes in engagement (helping, loyal boosterism, and job search behavior). In two field studies in the United States and Germany, we test this model, first in a single complex organizational ritual (i.e., company holiday party) and then across a broader set of common complex organizational rituals. Across both studies, we find that employees’ positive experiences during an organizational ritual enhance engagement and predict subsequent work behavior, while their effects can be significantly diminished by negative ritual experiences, challenging the assumption that rituals are uniformly beneficial. By providing evidence for a more balanced perspective on the impact of organizational rituals, our work provides a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the true nature of organizational rituals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A crisis is a juncture that demands decision and action. We live in times of wicked crises, that is, crises that are non-linearly interlinked; transgress organizational, institutional, and cultural boundaries; and can be addressed only collectively. Our chances to rise to wicked crises depend on our capacity to decide and to act in concert, which is power, according to political philosopher Hannah Arendt. In this essay, in honor ofAdministrative Science Quarterly’s 70th volume, I highlight different features of wicked crises and discuss two interrelated forces that weaken and undermine such power: first, organizational fragmentation, which results in governance complexity and fault lines, and second, societal fragmentation, which manifests in growing distrust in core cultural institutions, polarization, the loss of a shared lifeworld, and the rise of authoritarianism. I conclude with a call to action for our discipline.</content>

    <title>Relational Entrepreneurial Perseverance in Extreme Contexts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs who face recurring crises must repeatedly navigate lengthy recovery processes. In this article, we go beyond immediate responses and individual-level outcomes to focus on the evolution of entrepreneurial perseverance as entrepreneurs engage with broader recovery efforts post-crisis. We examined the experiences of 33 entrepreneurs during and following the Calbuco Volcano eruptions in Chile from 2015 to 2019. We discovered three social cues that reinforce entrepreneurial perseverance over extended periods of time: descriptive (the sharing of recovery memories), injunctive (the socialization of recovery work ethic), and symbolic (the celebration of recovery legacies). Findings show how socially reinforced entrepreneurial perseverance becomes intertwined with broader recovery efforts creating a sustained collective response to crisis, which we theorize asrelational entrepreneurial perseverancein extreme contexts. This changes our understanding of long-term entrepreneurial perseverance. Perseverance resides not simply in the individual entrepreneur but in social reinforcement, social support, and the capacity for connection, that is, the connection between individual actions, group principles, and community celebration. These create entrepreneurial recovery legacies that act as memory assets to be used when the next crisis hits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some firms pursue open design activities, that is, they freely share innovation-related knowledge with the outside world instead of keeping it secret or protected via patents. Through a series of lab and field studies, this research examines consumer beliefs and reactions to firms’ open design activities and documents a positiveopen design effect: presenting a product as open design (vs. not) increases its attractiveness to consumers. This effect emerges because consumers view firms that freely share innovation-related knowledge as providing benefits to society. Consistent with this societal benefits account, the effect is found to be stronger when (1) moral (vs. selfish) firm motives are made salient and (2) many (vs. few) other firms have already utilized the shared knowledge. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the effect is anchored in the notion that open design activities involve outflows of firm-internal (vs. inflows of firm-external) knowledge. By showing that consumers judge the way firms undertake innovation as more (vs. less) beneficial for society, this research extends the literatures on open design, open innovation, corporate social responsibility, and marketplace morality.</content>

    <title>From Diminishment to Development: A Sensemaking Model of How Life Experiences Foster Humility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is not uncommon for people to recount humbling experiences that have transformed how they see themselves and approach their work. Although the benefits of humbling experiences are widely assumed, we have an incomplete understanding of what these experiences entail and how they may help forge humility. Existing research consists largely of idiosyncratic lists of events that might be humbling without deeper inquiry into what makes these experiences unique or how they are integrated into one’s identity. Our theorizing combines insights from the sensemaking and humility literatures to specify the dynamic processes through which humbling experiences are internalized, including contingency factors that limit or enhance the impact of these events. This approach adds theoretical precision to the understanding of what it means to have had a humbling experience and challenges the implicit assumption that humility is a stable quality. In addition, we inform the debate about how humility relates to negative emotions and self-views by distinguishing humility itself from the process through which it is developed. Throughout the paper, we use leadership as an illustrative context to ground our theorizing, but the processes we propose apply across organizational roles. Altogether, this work provides a foundation for better understanding how humbling experiences cultivate humility—an attribute that allows individuals to approach their roles from a more self-aware, other-oriented perspective.</content>

    <title>The Illusion of Performance Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the wide adoption of performance management by organizations, there is little evidence that performance management works. In this paper, I critique both the methods and the goals of performance management. First, I note that performance management, through its reliance on top‐down decision making, robs workers of autonomy and responsibility. Next, I note that two of the three major components of performance management (aligning job performance goals with the strategic goals of the organization and using frequent informal feedback to manage performance) are flawed, and that efforts to manage performance using these tools are likely to fail. Rather than relying on managing performance, organizations should follow decades of research on supportive leadership and focus on supporting and facilitating performance rather than managing it. I call for more empirical research to evaluate the effectiveness of performance management and the effects of the various tools used to manage performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do community characteristics shape organizational responses to social issues? While existing research has focused primarily on firm-level attributes or issue characteristics, we argue that a community’s social structure systematically affects how external issues penetrate and resonate locally. We develop a theory of community permeability that links three structural features—network closure, segregation patterns, and issue connectedness—to both the local salience of social issues and subsequent firm responses. Our empirical analysis examines how thousands of locally owned CrossFit gyms in the U.S. responded to their CEO’s controversial statements following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a White police officer in 2020. Results show that issue salience was lower in communities characterized by stronger inward-focused ties and greater ethnic segregation but higher in communities more directly connected to populations affected by Floyd’s death. Firms operating in communities where the issue was more salient were more likely to respond, particularly when their dependence on community support was heightened by disruptions unrelated to the focal issue. Our study reveals how community social structure creates systematic variation in both issue salience and organizational responses, advancing understanding of when and why firms act on social issues.</content>

    <title>Cutting the apron strings: Establishing optimal distinctiveness from mentors in creative industries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research has established that organizations benefit from “optimal distinctiveness,” that is, being sufficiently similar to and different from competitors. However, we know less about producers' strategic positioning choices to establish optimally distinctive identities. We explore this question through a qualitative study of chef‐owners who started their own restaurants after training with well‐known mentors. We identify two trajectories followed by chefs to establish optimal distinctiveness—legacy and divergent—and their components: interpersonal origins, strategic material and symbolic practices, tensions, and performance outcomes. Our study contributes to research by providing a more complete picture of how creative producers attempt to find an optimal balance between similarity to and difference from mentors, and the constraints they face in their strategic choices, including how these change over time.</content>

    <title>Reinvesting or Consuming Dividends: Account Structure Matters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is a long-standing fact that households mostly consume and rarely reinvest dividends. Among representative brokerage clients of one of Germany’s largest banks, we find the opposite: 80% reinvestments, 12% consumption. Of these reinvestments, the majority occurs with a delay after dividends are initially parked as brokerage cash. Motivated by this finding, we study payout modalities (deposits into brokerage accounts, checking accounts, or checks) as a novel mechanism that nudges investors towards reinvesting or consuming dividends. Consistent with a transition from checks to brokerage deposits, we find that the dividend consumption rate in the CEX has decreased substantially over time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act expands bank managers’ reporting requirements to federal agencies, particularly relating to banks’ financial losses should common market and macroeconomic shocks occur. To comply with this regulation, bank managers have engaged in consulting arrangements (referred to as regulatory consulting). We examine the financial reporting quality implications associated with hiring external auditors for these services. We find banks with auditor-provided regulatory consulting, relative to banks without, have higher financial reporting quality as measured by loan loss provision validity. Consistent with knowledge spillover benefits accruing to financial audit teams, we find more pronounced effects in the fourth versus interim quarters and more frequent income-reducing Y9-C restatements. We also find auditor responsiveness to PCAOB inspections improves the effectiveness of regulatory consulting. Overall, our results suggest regulatory consulting improves the audits of estimates in judgmental financial statement accounts, despite regulatory concerns that these services may impair auditor independence.</content>

    <title>Communication, Learning, and Bargaining Breakdown: An Empirical Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bargaining breakdown is common in bargaining in environments with incomplete information. We study whether, in these environments, permitting communication impacts bargaining outcomes. On May 23, 2016, eBay Germany’s Best Offer platform introduced unstructured communication allowing desktop users, but not mobile users, to accompany offers with a message. Using this natural experiment, our difference-in-differences approach documents a 14% decrease in the rate of breakdown among compliers. Though adoption is immediate, the effect is not. We show, using text analysis, that the dynamics are consistent with repeat players learning how to use communication in bargaining. Finally, tying the two results together, we show that messages that emulate the text content of experienced sellers are more likely to be accepted.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: Part of this research was supported by the NSF [Grant SES-1629060].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00366 .</content>

    <title>Pricing Control and Regulation on Online Service Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An open debate in platform design is who should control pricing: the platform (centralized pricing) or its service providers (decentralized pricing). We show that a key trade-off is between regulating competition and enabling price tailoring. Centralized pricing allows the platform to manage competition, but it faces information asymmetry as it cannot observe agent costs. Decentralized pricing lets agents adjust prices to their costs, but without oversight, competition can become too strong (prices too low) or too weak (prices too high). For commission-based platforms, either form of price control can prevail depending on market conditions, implying that neither dominates. However, a relatively simple tweak—adopting an affine fee structure based on posted prices or quantities served—allows the platform to decentralize pricing control without sacrificing optimality. This flexibility further supports agent classification as independent contractors, offering platforms a valuable strategic option for how to structure their workforce.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: Supporting grants have been provided by the Mack Institute for Innovation Management and the Ripple University Blockchain Research Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04078 .</content>

    <title>A Modeling Framework for Tipping in the Presence of a Social Norm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tipping is a complex phenomenon cutting across various stakeholders—firms, customers, and workers. Analyzing the long-run impact of policies related to tipping is therefore challenging. To facilitate such analysis, we develop a modeling framework in which a tipping norm forms endogenously in a market consisting of a firm that offers service to potential customers. Customers choose whether to consume the service or not and, if yes, how much to tip the server afterward. With tipping, customers show appreciation to the server by sharing a fraction of their surplus but also undergo social pressure to comply with the prevailing norm. This tipping norm is shown to evolve endogenously through a dynamic process of sequential market adjustments over time: the average tip in each period determines the tipping norm for the following period, causing the firm to adapt the price and customers to adapt their tips accordingly. Characterization of this equilibrium outcome allows us to derive qualitative results on the long-run impact of different exogenous factors on tipping: we find that the equilibrium tip-to-price ratio increases when customers are more sensitive to social pressure, their range of service valuations spreads out, or they consider the service more valuable. Building on this framework, we further investigate several economic implications of tipping pertaining to social welfare, labor cost, and service quality, thus uncovering incentives and trade-offs to which the tipping mechanism gives rise from the firm, the worker, and the customer’s perspectives.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations and supply chain management.Funding: Financial support by The Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel, The Coller Foundation, and the Israeli Science Foundation [Grant 1361/23] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03422 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When Words Meet Visuals: How Content Composition Drives Social Media Engagement for Marketer-Generated Content</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the balance between text and pictorial content in marketer-generated social media posts affect user engagement? The authors address this question by using computer vision and natural language processing tools to extract the visual and textual features of 34,610 organic brand posts from Facebook and Instagram. Using a Confounding-and-Cluster-Robust Causal Forests model, they test how the balance of text and picture affects social media engagement across content and visual contexts. Results show that posts with greater emphasis on overlay text over pictorial content tend to have fewer likes and comments. However, the performance of text-oriented posts improves if text is more centered, informative, emotionally positive, and congruent with the pictorial content, and if the picture contains fewer prominent objects or less information such as social cues. They quantify how incremental changes in such content composition affect social media engagement. These findings set forth evidence-based principles for optimizing text and picture balance in marketer-generated content (MGC) and provide actionable guidelines on whether, where, when, and how to present text on an image. This research highlights the potential for transforming content and media creation from an imprecise art form into an empirical science nested within a data-driven visual optimization framework.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Trajectory of Confidence: Experience, Certainty, and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Confidence has an important influence on consumer behavior. Beyond what consumers know or believe, the confidence with which they hold those things (i.e., how certain they feel) shapes their judgments, decisions, and actions. But how does confidence shift as consumers gain experience? And what are the consequences for consumer choice? A multimethod investigation combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and experiments to examine these questions. Analysis of 3.7 million reviews from almost 100,000 consumers spanning nearly 30 years reveals a common confidence trajectory. Across diverse product categories (e.g., wine, beer, and cosmetics) there is a U-shaped relationship between experience and confidence. While gaining initial experience decreases confidence, eventually, with more experience, confidence rebounds. Further, feeling less confident leads consumers to avoid options associated with uncertainty and choose something different. This includes picking different products, avoiding brands associated with the uncertainty, and waiting longer to choose from those brands again. Taken together, this research sheds light on the evolution of confidence, how uncertainty shapes choice, and drivers of product switching and brand loyalty more generally.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of an MBA‐style executive education course in finance on corporate policies and firm performance targeting top managers of medium and large Mozambican enterprises. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the educational treatment induces changes in financial policies that improve firm performance. Specifically, a reduction in working capital (0.4 to 0.5 standard deviations) increases cash flow, and in turn long‐term investments. This effect operates primarily through a reduction in accounts receivable (0.4 to 1 standard deviations). Our findings show that targeted educational interventions can build managerial capital and enhance corporate performance by improving financial decision making among executives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of the U.S. money market fund reform implemented in October 2016 on global banks' funding supply and business activities. We show that the reform induced a large negative wholesale funding shock for global banks. In contrast to the conventional bank lending channel, the primary response of global banks to the reform was a cutback in arbitrage positions that relied on unsecured funding, rather than a reduction in loan provision. We discuss the role of postcrisis liquidity regulations and unconventional monetary policy in explaining our findings, and implications for banks' business models and deposit competition.</content>

    <title>Toward Artificial Intelligence Compliance: Impacts and Mechanisms of Performance Feedback</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance performance, ensuring that employees use AI in compliance with organizational policies becomes crucial for realizing its full value. However, employees’ AI compliance is not guaranteed and can vary based on how their AI use is managed. This study offers timely and actionable insights into how performance feedback—both positive and negative—influences employees’ AI compliance, and how these effects vary with AI identity. Drawing on feedback intervention theory, we conduct a longitudinal field study and a randomized experiment and find that positive performance feedback promotes AI compliance, whereas negative performance feedback reduces it. Importantly, employees with high AI identity respond more strongly to both types of performance feedback. Our findings further uncover distinct underlying mechanisms—task-motivation, task-learning, and meta-cognitive processes—that channel the effects of positive and negative performance feedback on AI compliance. Taken together, organizations should tailor performance feedback as part of AI governance by considering employees’ AI identity. Positive reinforcement of AI compliance is especially effective for employees with high AI identity, whereas cautions are needed when delivering negative performance feedback to avoid undermining AI compliance. Policy guidelines should support identity-sensitive performance feedback in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research AbstractWe study how providing knowledge about “how to do entrepreneurship” influences women's pre‐entry decision to enroll in micro‐entrepreneurship training in poverty settings. We carry out a field experiment study with unemployed women in rural India, randomly exposing them to “founding templates” that depict simple and replicable business set‐ups and practices. We find that exposure to founding templates, especially those that exemplify social support rather than self‐dependence, significantly increases women's sign‐ups to entrepreneurship training. We also find that increased sign‐ups are accompanied by enhanced perceived ease of starting a business. These results shed light on what motivates women in the pre‐entry stage and offer insights on how to increase enrolment, ultimately broadening women's participation in entrepreneurship in poverty contexts.Managerial AbstractMicro‐entrepreneurship training is a widely used intervention to support women's participation in entrepreneurship in poverty settings. While existing research predominantly focuses on assessing the impact of such interventions, we ask when women are motivated to sign up for training in the first place. Our study involved a full‐day information workshop, targeting unemployed women in rural India and providing them with frameworks and practical examples of replicable business setups and practices. Results indicate that access to templates, especially those that exemplify social support rather than self‐dependence, significantly boosts women's confidence and motivation to consider entrepreneurship as a viable option. We thus identify a key institutional lever for broadening the funnel of women's entry into training and entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A New Perspective on Resilience in Flexible Supply SystemsSupply disruptions and demand uncertainty are persistent threats in today’s global operations landscape. In “Process Flexibility: A Distribution-Free Approach to Long Chain Resilience,” Chen, Chou, and Sun revisit the long-standing concept of long chain flexibility and demonstrate its resilience in the face of supply-side risks. By deriving a closed-form bound on expected sales relative to full flexibility, the study offers a robust, distribution-free guarantee that highlights the long chain’s ability to hedge against disruptions. The authors further generalize their findings using a novel moment decomposition approach, extending applicability to a broader range of service metrics and capacity-demand scenarios via semidefinite programming. Their results not only reaffirm the demand-pooling power of long chains but also position them as a highly resilient configuration in disrupted environments, offering practical insights for capacity planning in uncertain supply chains.</content>

    <title>Toward a Liquid Biopsy: Greedy Approximation Algorithms for Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses challenges in developing liquid biopsies for early-stage cancer detection through active sequential hypothesis testing (ASHT). In the problem of ASHT, a learner seeks to identify the true hypothesis (true cancer type) from a known set of hypotheses (candidate cancer types). The learner is given a set of actions (sequencing genetic intervals) and knows the distribution of the random outcome (whether a mutation is detected) of any action under any true hypothesis. Given a target error [Formula: see text], the goal is to sequentially select the fewest number of actions to identify the true hypothesis with probability at least [Formula: see text]. Motivated by applications in which the number of hypotheses or actions is massive (e.g., genomics-based cancer detection), we propose efficient greedy algorithms and provide the first approximation guarantees for ASHT, under two types of adaptivity. Our guarantees are independent of the number of actions and logarithmic in the number of hypotheses. Numerical tests on synthetic and real DNA mutation data show that our algorithms significantly outperform previous heuristic policies.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00829 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The structure of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) generates significant information asymmetry for public investors and provides a special role for its sponsors. Leveraging the unique characteristics of SPACs, this study reexamines the debate over the role of managerial network centrality in affecting M&amp;A outcomes, namely, whether network centrality allows for more private benefits or rather adds value to firms and helps reduce information asymmetry. Specifically, we show that sponsors’ private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) connections, measured by their network centrality, explain a large portion of postmerger return variation in the cross-section. A one-standard-deviation increase in sponsors’ network centrality leads to a 1.9% higher merger and acquisition success probability and a 1.3% higher postmerger monthly abnormal return. We attribute this outperformance of firms with high managerial PE network centrality to superior fundraising and deal-sourcing abilities. Moreover, this effect is particularly pronounced in a cold market and among SPAC sponsors with more “skin in the game.” Overall, we show that network connections reflect managers’ value-creation ability more than their rent-seeking capacity; these connections can add value to mergers and help alleviate information asymmetry and associated moral hazard issues, especially when managers’ private benefits are closely linked to postmerger firm performance.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do venture capital investors react to social movements, including those that relate to historical underrepresentation in funding? We use image and name algorithms combined with clerical review to classify race for 150,000 founders and 30,000 investors. These data allow us to assess the impact of George Floyd’s murder on VC funding of Black entrepreneurs and identify which VCs were most responsive. Although VCs responded swiftly, investment in Black-founded startups reverted to prior levels within two years. This temporary reaction was concentrated among those who had never previously invested in any Black entrepreneur. Moreover, the investors who responded were less likely to invest in more than one Black-founded startup and were less inclined to engage deeply by taking a board seat. Finally, it appears that the best Black entrepreneurs may have anticipated this “token” response because they did not match with investors who had no experience funding Black startups.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06410 .</content>

    <title>Superstar Returns? Spatial Heterogeneity in Returns to Housing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper makes the first comprehensive attempt to study within‐country heterogeneity of housing returns. We introduce a new city‐level data set covering 15 OECD countries over 150 years and show that national housing markets are characterized by systematic spatial variation in housing returns. Total returns in large agglomerations are close to 100 basis points lower per year than in other parts of the same country. Excess returns outside the large cities can be rationalized as compensation for higher risk, especially higher covariance with income growth and lower liquidity. Real estate in diversified large agglomerations is comparatively safe.</content>

    <title>Chief Information Security Officers on Top Management Teams: Impact on Firms’ Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing frequency of information security breaches and the rising importance of cybersecurity have prompted many firms to include chief information security officers (CISOs) in their top management teams (TMTs). Although CISOs are often viewed narrowly through a security-focused lens, our research shows that their inclusion in TMTs can offer a strategic advantage by significantly enhancing firm innovation. We identify three mechanisms that explain this effect: (1) reducing preventable security risks that might otherwise hinder innovation efforts; (2) enabling the adoption of innovation technologies (e.g., cloud computing, big data) that carry strategic security risks; and (3) strengthening security controls that protect intellectual property and mitigate innovation-related threats. Importantly, the CISO’s background matters. Those with specialized experience—either in the same industry or with prior executive roles—have a stronger impact on driving innovation. This research illuminates how CISOs’ presence on TMTs affects firms’ value creation from a security risk management perspective, and provides guidance for firms seeking to hire CISOs for innovation.</content>

    <title>Geographical Pattern of Online Word of Mouth: How Offline Environment Influences Online Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key feature of e-commerce is the access to a wide range of geographical areas; e-commerce platforms spend much effort customizing their strategies across geographical areas. Meanwhile, online word of mouth (WOM) is becoming an increasingly important driver for product sales on e-commerce platforms. This study investigates the geographical pattern of online WOM. Specifically, we examine whether and how customers’ local environment influences the generation and direction of online WOM. Leveraging a unique research design, we measure the online WOM at a U.S. national e-commerce platform by tracking the WOM referral decisions of customers. Whereas digital technologies have enabled customers to share without physical boundaries, we find that location still plays significant roles in the generation and direction of online WOM. First, a customer’s offline social environment (e.g., friend visiting frequency, neighbor interactions) significantly explains the generation of online referrals. Second, online referrals are largely bounded locally, and referrals in areas with more local social interactions are more likely to stay local. Third, even when referrals travel far, they are more likely to point to destinations socially similar to the origins. We derive important implications for firms in allocating resources across geographical areas and in using referrals to identify high-potential geographical markets.</content>

    <title>Does earnings management matter for strategy research?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategic management research often uses accounting data, despite well‐known concerns that earnings management could obscure the link between actual and measured performance. We apply methods from the econometric literature on bunching to estimate that around 15 percent of firm‐year observations in Compustat manipulate accounting earnings to achieve profitability. We show that cash‐based performance measures are less susceptible to manipulation and that the choice of accrual versus cash‐based measures “matters” for two classic strategy research questions: a decomposition of ROA variance and an analysis of persistence in firm performance. These findings underscore the importance of robustness testing and contribute to an emerging literature that reconsiders the link between theoretical constructs and empirical performance measures.Managerial SummaryTo understand what drives firm performance, researchers and practitioners often rely on reported accounting measures from annual reports. The most commonly used income‐based measures are strategically inflated or deflated through accounting and operational choices (i.e., earnings management). This article finds that approximately 15 percent of the time that ROA is reported for a fiscal year, a loss would have been reported instead of a gain if not for this manipulation. We then analyze the impact earnings management has on two types of profitability analysis by comparing accrual‐based or cash‐based profit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends the rare disaster framework by introducing a model with a time-varying disaster recovery feature. The model yields closed-form pricing formulas for stocks and dividend strips. Calibrated using international disaster data, it quantitatively captures both the unconditional and conditional term structures of equity risk premia. It replicates key empirical patterns, including a downward-sloping unconditional term structure of one-period returns and a countercyclical conditional slope, and generates novel predictions for CAPM beta, alpha, and price.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Analytical Insights on Inventory AllocationHow should a limited inventory of a single resource be allocated across multiple customer groups with distinct rewards and arrival rates, especially when each group has a finite population? In their paper “Optimal allocation of limited inventory among multiclass customers with finite populations” in Operations Research, the authors develop a stochastic framework and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process. By analyzing the structure of the optimal value function, they reveal a new insight; rather than gradually expanding access to lower-priority groups over time, it is in fact optimal to progressively restrict access to these groups. The paper also introduces a fluid model with an explicit solution, which provides a good approximation when the system size is large. These findings offer both theoretical and practical contributions to inventory allocation problems, with potential applications in healthcare and humanitarian resource management as well as commercial product sales.</content>

    <title>Substitution Between Corporate Social Responsibility Activities: Evidence from Hiring and Mistreating Unauthorized Workers and Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue substitution can exist among corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments, and exogenously increasing one CSR investment could lead to a decrease in another CSR investment. We provide evidence using the U.S. states’ staggered adoptions of E-Verify mandates, which curtail a labor-related social bad by reducing the hiring of unauthorized workers and related workplace abuses. We find the mandate leads to an increase in plant-level pollution, an environmental social bad, and the effect is stronger when the mandate applies to more employers, for plants in states with more unauthorized workers in the labor force, and for plants with jobs that are inherently more hazardous.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Project 24502422].Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02310 .</content>

    <title>Invest Local or Remote? The Effects of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Venture Capital Investment Around the World</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find the “death of distance” in venture capital (VC) investment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: VCs invest in more distant startups during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and such effects continue after the economy reopens. The death of distance is more pronounced when there is better internet infrastructure, lower information asymmetry between VCs and entrepreneurs, and smaller deal size. The pandemic-spurred advancement and adoption of remote communication technology contribute to the documented observations. The death of distance in VC investment implies more vibrant entry of outside VCs into geographically localized markets, intensified competition among VCs, and mitigated regional inequality of entrepreneurial access to VC financing.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: P.

    <title>Do Professional Rankings Affect Analyst Behavior? Evidence From a Regression Discontinuity Design</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how winning a significant industry award affects the behavior of finance professionals. Focusing on sell-side equity analysts and utilizing a novel data set from Institutional Investor on analyst rankings, we employ a regression discontinuity design that compares the postaward research outputs and behavior of third-place, all-star analysts with those of first runner-up analysts who barely miss the distinction. Our results show that third-place all-star winners are more optimistic in their forecasts and recommendations compared with first runner-up analysts after winning the award, and market reactions to their forecast revisions are stronger. The third-place winners also receive higher priority during earnings conference calls and experience better career outcomes. Our evidence is consistent with award-winning analysts leveraging their increased reputation and market influence to generate more trading commissions and career benefits. The broader inference of our findings is that finance professionals who win a significant award are likely to become more, rather than less, strategic.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04249 .</content>

    <title>Competitive Dynamics in the Political Marketplace: How Donor Firms’ Political Wins Prompt Product-Market Peers to Appoint Politicians to Their Boards</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a regression discontinuity design in a sample of U.S. federal special elections, we investigate how donor firms’ political wins impact the adaptive responses of their product-market peers in their political activities, with a particular focus on the appointment of politicians to their boardrooms. By analyzing closely contested special elections, we find that when donor firms had donated to a candidate who narrowly won a special election, their peer firms were 41% more likely to appoint politicians to their boards in the following year than peers of the donor firms that had supported a narrowly defeated candidate. This adaptive response is more pronounced among peer firms facing greater political risks and operating in industries with more intense competition for government sales. Donor firms’ political wins also lead peer firms to increase their product differentiation from those donor firms. We interpret these patterns as evidence of a competitive-dynamics mechanism, where peer firms perceive donor firms’ political wins as a threat that could disadvantage them in the regulatory environment, prompting them to strengthen their boards with political capital to navigate potential regulatory changes and mitigate perceived risks. Our findings enrich scholarly understandings of corporate political activities and director selections.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: Z.

    <title>Ultra-Fresh Fashion: Creating Demand with Freshness and Agility</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using agile supply chains, fast fashion companies have been viewed as best practice examples in industries. Prior research focuses on how agility can equip such companies with strong sense-and-respond capabilities to identify and fulfill unpredictable customer demands. There is another powerful dimension of agility—the ability to create new products frequently—that has enabled recent market success of companies such as Shein and Temu, labeled by some industry press as ultra-fast fashion. These companies, relying on end-to-end digital technologies, have pushed this dimension of agility to unprecedentedly high levels, launching new products with great frequency and variety. The frequent product launches create freshness, stimulating latent demands of consumers and making these companies “ultra-fresh” fashion, a term we adopt in this paper. We seek to model this dimension of agility as an operational strategy for demand creation. Our model enables us to explore the effects through the lens of profit to the firm, consumer surplus, and environmental impact. Our analysis reveals that frequent product launches, high variety, and low prices—the three salient features of ultra-fresh fashion—are driven by both the product design agility and the customers’ interest for product freshness. The ultra-fresh strategy allows steady profit increase for the firm and benefits consumers in aggregate but may cause negative environmental impact if left unchecked.This paper was accepted by Jay Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06249 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use newly assembled data overall encompassing up to 75 countries and starting circa 1910, to study impediments to the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction as it “proceeds by competitively destroying old businesses.” Political connections appear to represent an obstacle to the destructive part of the Schumpeterian process in the replacement of large firms. When accompanied by regulations that restrict entry, political connections can play a role in allowing large firms to remain large. When connected to Fogel, Morck, and Yeung (2008,Journal of Financial Economics89, 83–108), the results imply that political connections, combined with barriers to entry, can retard economic development.</content>

    <title>Impacts of Reducing Visibility of Friends’ Liked Content on User Content Engagement Across Newsfeed Channels</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nowadays, online platforms constantly adjust their newsfeeds to boost engagement, often emphasizing nonsocial channels such as algorithmic recommendations over social ones such as user networks. However, ignoring the interactions between these channels can have unintended consequences. This study delves into this by assessing the impacts of a policy change that reduced the visibility of friends’ liked content on a major discussion platform. We found this led to an overall decrease in users’ content engagement. Although users engaged more with their friends’ original posts and trending topics, their interaction with nonsocial content such as algorithmic recommendations decreased. This reveals a key insight: social channels act as substitutes for one another but are complementary to nonsocial, algorithmic channels. Vibrant social activity is crucial for driving traffic to other parts of a platform. Crucially, the change also made users’ content engagement less diverse. Friends’ liked content is a key source of exposure to niche topics. For platform operators, this means that sidelining social features in favor of algorithmic feeds can backfire, reducing overall engagement and diversity. For policymakers concerned about online echo chambers, our findings suggest that content shared through extended social networks is vital for promoting a wider range of content.</content>

Using a fixed-effects approach, we find that external actuaries significantly affect the opportunism in the claim loss reserve, approaching half the effect of the auditor. With respect to actuary characteristics, we find a positive (negative) association between actuary permissiveness (actuary size) and opportunism in the claim loss reserve. In additional analyses, we find that the relation between actuary permissiveness and claim loss reserve opportunism is stronger when insurers have incentives to opportunistically manage the claim loss reserve. This relation continues to persist in the presence of high-quality auditors. Overall, we provide evidence suggesting that client-engaged external actuaries can be used to support opportunistic claim loss reserve estimates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through an observational field study involving quantitative and qualitative components, we explore the role of gender diversity in shaping the effectiveness of mentorship for founder teams seeking investors. Data on 984 teams of founders assigned to teams of mentors at Techstars-run accelerator programs around the world demonstrate the interteam benefits of aligned gender diversity thresholds: Founder teams characterized by the presence (absence) of gender diversity engage more investors when matched with mentor teams also characterized by the presence (absence) of gender diversity. Neither the presence of gender diversity in the founder team nor the presence of gender diversity in the mentor team exerts a positive influence on investor counts as a standalone factor, but the aligned presence of intrateam gender diversity helps ventures maximize participating investors. We find that the number of participating investors has a positive downstream impact, increasing the amount of funding that the venture raises. Results are robust to the inclusion of controls for venture, founder, and mentor characteristics, with clustering at the Techstars cohort level. Qualitative insights from 20 semistructured interviews reveal how interteam gender alignment facilitates interpersonal attraction, whereas intrateam gender diversity enables resource acquisition. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this phenomenon for internal-external team interactions in venture funding and beyond.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2025.20141 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating Fairness into Online Price DiscriminationIn the paper “Fairness-aware online price discrimination with nonparametric demand models,” Xi Chen, Jiameng Lyu, Xuan Zhang, and Yuan Zhou explore how fairness can be integrated into dynamic pricing strategies. The authors propose a model that enforces price fairness constraints, ensuring that price differences between customer groups remain within a specified range. Their approach introduces a novel regret lower bound, which contrasts with the typical regret seen in traditional pricing algorithms. This shift underscores the added complexity of optimizing revenue while maintaining fairness. The study not only advances the understanding of fairness-aware dynamic pricing but also enriches the dynamic pricing literature by offering new lower-bound techniques. These insights may be useful for deriving lower bounds in other problems related to learning optimal prices under constraints. Their work contributes significantly to the growing need for ethical pricing practices in data-driven markets.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Pricing for Reusable Resources: The Power of Two Prices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two Prices Unlock Big Gains for Reusable ResourcesHow much sophistication is needed to price reusable resources, like hotel rooms and cloud computing, when usage durations are not memoryless? Surprisingly little. In “Dynamic Pricing for Reusable Resources: The Power of Two Prices,” Balseiro, Ma, and Zhang propose a class of dynamic stock-dependent policies that achieve significant improvements over static pricing by only looking at how many units are busy and ignoring how long they have been busy. Using an “insensitivity” property of loss networks, they show that optimizing within this policy class can be formulated as a tractable convex optimization problem. Better yet, the performance loss of the optimal stock-dependent policy can be achieved by a simple two-price policy: charge a high price when inventory falls below a threshold and a low price otherwise. Extensions to multiple resources and customer classes, together with extensive simulations, confirm that “just a little” dynamicity can go a long way.</content>

    <title>Mass Vaccination Scheduling: Trading Off Infections, Throughput, and Overtime</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mass vaccination is essential for epidemic control, but long queues can increase infection risk. We study how to schedule arrivals at a mass vaccination center to minimize a tri-objective function of (a) the expected number of infections acquired while waiting, (b) throughput, and (c) overtime. Leveraging multimodularity results of a related optimization problem, we construct a solution algorithm and apply it to a case study of COVID-19. We find that although the standard equally distributed, equally spaced schedule sits near the Pareto-optimal frontier, it is located away from a sharp elbow in the tradeoff between infections and overtime. Specifically, the “elbow policy” achieves approximately 38% fewer expected infections for nearly the same expected overtime. We also discuss managerial insights around the structure of the optimal schedule and compare it to the well-known “dome-shaped” policies found in other appointment scheduling settings.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02958 .</content>

    <title>On‐Demand Schedules, Worker Absenteeism and Patient Dissatisfaction in Home Care Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service companies often adopt on‐demand scheduling to balance labor costs and fluctuating market demand. However, research shows that such practices can reduce worker productivity and retention. In this study, we examine how on‐demand scheduling affects two critical outcomes: worker absenteeism and patient dissatisfaction. We extend the conceptualization of undesirable scheduling by introducingschedule discontinuity—the presence of unpaid interruptions within a worker's daily schedule—alongside the more commonly studiedschedule inconsistency, or variability in work hours across weeks. Using data on 1.2 million home care visits in a Canadian healthcare provider, we find that both schedule inconsistency and discontinuity significantly increase absenteeism and patient dissatisfaction. Specifically, moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in discontinuity (inconsistency) raises absenteeism by 20.00% (19.29%), and customer complaints by 27.33% (40.27%). To assess the practical implications for employers, we formulate and solve a schedule optimization problem that minimizes schedule discontinuity (or inconsistency), while satisfying demand and supply constraints. Applying a machine learning predictive model to these optimized schedules, we estimate reductions in the probability of absenteeism by 9.5% (8.2%) and in the probability of patient complaints by 7.7% (2.3%), demonstrating that modest scheduling adjustments can substantially improve worker and service outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a pricing kernel with time-varying volatility risk aversion to explain the observed time variations in the shape of the pricing kernel. When combined with the Heston-Nandi GARCH model, this framework yields a tractable option pricing model in which the variance risk ratio (VRR) emerges as a key variable. We show that the VRR is closely linked to economic fundamentals, as well as sentiment and uncertainty measures. A novel approximation method provides analytical option pricing formulas, and we demonstrate substantial reductions in pricing errors through an empirical application to the S&amp;P 500 index, the CBOE VIX, and option prices.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating Expert Views into Investment ModelsHow can investors best incorporate forward-looking expert views into dynamic portfolio strategies? “Dynamic Black-Litterman,” by Anas Abdelhakmi and Andrew Lim, offers a novel solution.The authors generalize the classic Black-Litterman model to a dynamic setting, allowing for continuous trading and expert views of events over varying time horizons that arrive over time. They derive the explicit dynamics of asset prices after incorporating these views, uncovering a surprising and elegant connection to multidimensional Brownian bridges.Remarkably, the paper provides a closed-form solution for the optimal dynamic portfolio policy, a significant finding for a model of this complexity. This includes a specific hedging component to protect against changes in expert views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach consistently outperforms strategies that repeatedly apply the single-period model, leading to higher returns and lower portfolio turnover.</content>

    <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Day-ahead electricity auctions allow market participants to trade power for delivery the following day. In Europe, these auctions are designed as combinatorial auctions, enabling agents to submit package bids (“block bids”) that span multiple time periods rather than bidding separately for each hour. However, power exchanges impose limits on the number of package bids an agent can submit, creating a complex decision problem: Which packages should an agent bid on to best represent their preferences? In “Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives,” Hübner and Hug study this selection problem and propose decision-support algorithms that optimize bid choice under uncertainty. They provide theoretical bounds on welfare loss due to bid limits and validate their methods with simulations involving generators, storage systems, and flexible demand. Their findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and bidders.</content>

    <title>Balancing External vs. Internal Validity: An Application of Causal Forest in Finance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Answering causal questions with generalizable results is challenging. Estimators requiring pseudorandomization provide estimates with no bias (i.e., strong internal validity) but limited generalizability (i.e., weak external validity). Theoretically, causal forest, a nonparametric, machine learning–based matching estimator, can provide low-to-no-bias, generalizable estimates even when treatment is endogenous. We empirically compare the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS), regression discontinuity design (RDD), and causal forest at recovering estimates in simulated observational panel data and show the robustness of causal forest estimates to many sources of bias. We revisit a popular RDD setting, debt covenant default, to show how extendable, heterogeneous causal forest estimates can enhance inferences.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00109 .</content>

    <title>Optimal Integration: Human, Machine, and Generative AI</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the optimal integration of humans and technologies in multilayered decision-making processes. When each layer can correct existing errors but may also introduce new errors, who should have the final authority? I show that a decision maker’s correction capability normalized by its new errors is a one-dimensional quality metric that determines the optimal rule: deploying higher quality technologies in later stages. Intriguingly, despite its highest quality, the final layer may not generate the greatest error reduction; instead, its role hinges on minimizing new errors. Human effort varies asymmetrically across layers: early stages exert relatively lower effort and prioritize error correction, whereas later stages exert higher effort and focus on avoiding new errors. Applying the model to artificial intelligence (AI) reveals that AI’s generative capabilities make it more likely to serve as the final decision maker, reducing the need for costly human input at the risks of AI hallucination. The theoretical framework also extends to applications including repeated delegation, automation design, loan screening, tenure review, and other multilayer decision-making scenarios.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.</content>

    <title>How Causal Focus and Specificity in Risk Factor Disclosures Jointly Affect Investor Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how investors’ investment judgments are jointly affected by two important linguistic features that vary considerably across firms’ risk factor disclosures: namely, causal focus—the extent to which managers’ disclosures focus on the causes versus consequences of risk events—and specificity, which refers to specific references to names of objects and quantitative values. Results of controlled experiments show that, when the disclosure focus is on risk causes, greater specificity increases investment willingness because of enhanced feelings of knowable uncertainty in a risk event. In contrast, when the focus is on risk consequences, greater specificity reduces investment willingness because of diminished feelings of knowable uncertainty. Contrary to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positive view of specific risk factor disclosures, our results suggest that specificity can have an opposite effects on investors’ judgments depending on the causal focus of risk factor disclosures.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by Korea University Business School and the United Overseas Bank Professorship Endowment Fund.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00445 .</content>

    <title>Cut to the Curve: Underrecognition and Talent Loss from Forced Ranking in a Multinational Firm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines unintended consequences of enforcing a curve on performance rankings. I examine a multinational company where some employees are downgraded from the top levels of rankings due to a strict recognition cutoff. I show that downgraded employees are at least 34% more likely to voluntarily exit, and that attempts by the organization to manage employee concerns, particularly regarding concerns of fairness, envy, and self-image, do not have the intended retention effect. Underrecognized employees leave even though the organization avoids calibration bias, offers reassurance about their career prospects, and compensates them with larger bonuses than their top-ranked peers. In robustness checks, I show that under these conditions even high-performing employees not nominated to the top ranks are more likely to voluntarily depart despite receiving the largest bonuses. These findings suggest that, where underrecognition occurs due to the restriction of top rankings, the mechanisms producing demotivation are more powerful than the management strategies meant to combat them.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01204 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on a comprehensive data set of classified (staggered) boards covering nearly all U.S. public firms from 1991 to 2020, we show that contrary to conventional wisdom, the use of classified boards remains widespread. Moreover, classified board usage over a firm's life cycle depends significantly on the decade the firm matured or year it went public. While classified boards were rarely removed in the 1990s, firms became more likely to declassify as they matured during the following decades. Decreased collective action costs and increased innovation‐related investments, institutional ownership, and scrutiny of governance contributed to this more dynamic adjustment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a new measure of firms' disclosure based on company websites, which are widely available and contain a wealth of information. For a sample of U.S. public firms, we construct our disclosure measure using historical website data, validate it by correlating it with extant measures of disclosure and information asymmetry, and explore its determinants. We then apply our measure to the study of U.S. private firms' disclosure and French firms' compliance with a nonfinancial disclosure mandate. Our applications illustrate that our website‐based measure provides a useful complement to extant measures of disclosure, which are more narrowly focused on investors in public capital markets.</content>

    <title>Sponsored Tasks and Solver Participation in Crowdsourcing Contests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing platforms provide venues for firms looking for solutions (seekers) to interact with individuals who can provide solutions (solvers). As crowdsourcing contest platforms have grown in popularity, with numerous tasks being posted on a daily basis, a concern that has emerged is that many similar tasks compete for solver attention, with some tasks failing to attract sufficient solver participation. To alleviate this concern, in addition to regular task listings, many crowdsourcing platforms offer sponsorship programs under which seekers pay an extra fee for highlighting their tasks to draw solvers’ attention. We examine the effect of sponsorship on solver participation using a unique data set collected from a leading crowdsourcing platform. In contrast to platforms’ claims about the effect of sponsorship on participation, we find that sponsorship does not always boost participation in crowdsourcing contests; sponsorship increases the number of participants only when the task’s prize amount is already high. Furthermore, even when the number of participants increases, the increase comes primarily from low-ability solvers. We also find that when sponsorship increases the total number of submissions, it does so only by increasing the number of participants; sponsorship does not increase the number of submissions that individual solvers submit after joining a task. More granular analyses reveal an effect of anticipated increased competition caused by sponsorship on high-ability solvers that is not observed on those of low ability, explaining the difference in their participation decisions when facing sponsored tasks. We also find that the effect of sponsorship weakens over the duration of a task for high-ability solvers and is also weaker for solvers with more experience on the platform.History: Yong Tan, Senior Editor.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2021.0246 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how autonomous Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams prioritize competing financial and social goals during 9‐1‐1 calls. Prior research highlights organization‐level solutions that enable single‐goal pursuit, but it remains unclear how frontline professionals manage competing goals that are interdependent and inseparable during task execution. We argue EMS teams will dynamically prioritize goals across calls depending on contextual factors. Using quasi‐random assignment of 9‐1‐1 patients to EMS crews in 31 US states, we find that crews prioritize the financial goal on private insurance calls but shift toward the social goal when agency financial need is low or call acuity is high. Surprisingly, these patterns are most pronounced in non‐profit EMS agencies. Our study offers new insight into how professionals manage goal trade‐offs in real time.Managerial SummaryWhat happens when professionals must pursue competing goals—like financial performance and equitable service—but organizations cannot separate them across tasks? Using data from 31 US states, we examine how Emergency Medical Service (EMS) teams navigate this tension during 9‐1‐1 calls. We find that crews dynamically prioritize goals based on perceived risk and opportunity—even without managerial intervention or immediate incentives. Teams provide more services to privately insured patients to increase revenue but shift toward equitable care when patient needs are more urgent or agency finances are stable. Surprisingly, these trade‐offs are most pronounced in non‐profit agencies. Our findings suggest that when goals collide within tasks, managers can shape frontline decision‐making by influencing how professionals understand goal risk and opportunity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock returns exhibit reversals at short horizons but slowly transition to momentum over longer horizons. To help understand this pattern, we develop a multiperiod model with short- and long-horizon noise traders, and active investors who underreact to information they do not themselves produce. The model accords with the transition from reversals to momentum and yields the following novel predictions: (a) attenuated reversals after earnings announcements, (b) a negative relation between monthly reversal and longer-term momentum profits across economies and time, and (c) larger reversals when there is more noise trading. Empirical analysis using U.S. and international data supports these predictions. (JEL G12, G14, G41)</content>

    <title>The Confirmation Nudge: Prompts to Change or Confirm Initial Preferences Steer Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Across two field experiments and several pre-registered laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that confirmation nudges, which ask consumers whether they would like to confirm or change their initial choice, impact choice. First, consumers navigating a subscription company’s smartphone app were randomized to a control or confirmation nudge condition, which asked them to either confirm their initial choice or switch to an annual subscription. Confirmation nudges increased subscribers’ choice of the annual subscription by over 8 percentage points–an effect size similar to default effects tested by the same company. In Experiment 2, conducted by a jewelry retailer, confirmation nudges had countervailing effects, increasing purchases of a nudged service plan add-on, but decreasing originally-planned jewelry purchases likely because it added a step and thus frictions to the purchase process. Confirmation nudges had larger effects when nudged options were desirable and among consumers who would benefit from the nudge (Experiments 3-4). But, they were perceived as more manipulative than comparison conditions (Experiment 5). We suggest that confirmation nudges undo tendencies to focus on initially-preferred options, shifting attention towards alternatives relative to control conditions. Consistent with this, confirmation nudges were especially effective when the wording of the confirmation prompt focused on the “switch” option.</content>

    <title>Is There Fairness in AI?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly steer workplace decisions, debates around fairness have intensified. Existing research often approaches fairness either as a set of universal principles supported or undermined by algorithms, or as a product of social interpretations, thereby providing either technologically deterministic or purely social accounts. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a human resources (HR) department of a large international company that introduced AI in hiring, this study offers an alternative view that shifts focus to how fairness emerges through the ways people define, embed, and perform values with algorithms. Taking a sociomaterial perspective, we find that the introduction and use of AI resulted in crowding out expert practices of performing fairness, favouring instead the version performed by HR. Our process model explains this outcome by the growing symbiosis between HR's professional mandate for fairness and AI procedures, where each legitimizes, shapes, and protects the other over time. This study thus shows that fairness is not pre‐given but constantly redefined and enacted through evolving associations between professional mandates and AI technologies.</content>

    <title>Not All Political Ties Are the Same: Firms’ Ties to the Government and Pollution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complementing research on the implications of political ties for firms’ strategic decisions and financial performance, recent studies are increasingly focusing on the environmental consequences of firms’ political connections. We contribute to this stream of work by integrating insights from the literature on political ties and the multifaceted nature of governments to explore how the level of government influences the pollution implications of firms’ political ties. Specifically, we theorize and demonstrate that, in China, firms’ achieved political ties with high levels of the government reduce pollution, while such ties with low levels of the government increase it. Furthermore, we examine how these relationships are moderated by firm owners’ social class and the attention by different levels of the government to their respective primary goals. Our analysis of data from 6,758 privately-owned Chinese enterprises provides support for our predictions. Our main conceptual contribution is to add more nuance to the research on political ties by highlighting the contingent role of the level of government in shaping firms’ pollution outcomes.</content>

    <title>Stick together or break apart? Stigmatizing adverse events, media vilification, and unplanned alliance dissolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article advances the understanding of alliance instability by integrating organizational stigma and signaling theories to explain unplanned alliance dissolution after potentially stigmatizing adverse events. We highlight the media as a key intermediary influencing whether partners stick together or break apart. We also argue that firm status and external corporate governance serve as signals that key stakeholders interpret differently, that is, amplifying media vilification but mitigating the event's impact on partners' decision to dissolve the alliance. Using a sample of US passenger airlines from 1985 to 2016, our findings support the view that it takes more than a stigmatizing event to disrupt an alliance. By establishing boundaries for stigmatization effects and contextualizing firm‐specific signals, we offer a nuanced explanation of the mechanisms driving alliance instability.Managerial SummaryFirms inevitably face adverse events, from uncontrollable accidents to errors, resulting in severe consequences such as diminished valuation and damaged reputation. In such situations, executives of the firm affected by an adverse event must decide whether to rely on their alliance partners to stick with their firm or prepare for the eventuality that partners will run away. To address this question, we conducted a 31‐year study of 40 publicly traded US airline companies. Our findings underscore the impact of negative media coverage on unplanned alliance dissolution, surpassing the influence of event characteristics; they draw the attention of affected firms’ executives to the dual implications of their firms’ status and external corporate governance – a double‐edged sword that requires careful consideration.</content>

    <title>Self‐regulation, corruption, and competitiveness in extractive industries: Making transparency pay</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self‐regulation is often proposed as a substitute for government regulation. We examine a setting in which a subset of firms voluntarily committed to transparency standards despite immediate competitive disadvantages, not merely to preempt regulation but to succeed under future mandatory rules they helped enact through lobbying. Focusing on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an anti‐corruption multi‐stakeholder initiative, we show that firms initially incurred competitive costs in corrupt markets after endorsing EITI. These firms subsequently lobbied for mandatory disclosure regulations. Once mandatory rules took effect, previously disadvantaged transparent firms gained substantial competitive advantages. Our study highlights how firms can integrate voluntary commitment with political advocacy to resolve collective action problems, reshaping both competitive dynamics and the regulatory landscape.Managerial SummaryFirms frequently sign onto voluntary pro‐social or pro‐environmental initiatives to placate activists, avoid tougher regulation, or burnish reputations. We examine global oil and mining companies that backed the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), even though transparency commitments initially hurt their ability to win licenses in highly corrupt countries. Rather than stopping at voluntary disclosure, these firms aggressively campaigned for mandatory payment‐reporting laws that would level the competitive playing field. When governments eventually imposed those rules, early EITI supporters gained significant, sustained advantages. The study shows that combining voluntary transparency with targeted political advocacy lets companies steer regulation, convert short‐term costs into long‐term strategic gains, and address corruption.</content>

    <title>When mimicry leads to divergence: Interdependence asymmetries and selective imitation among competitors</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate why firms imitating the same competitor's strategy in the same environment often replicate different components of that strategy. We argue that such divergence can arise because firms vary in the internal interdependencies that underlie their strategies. When a firm significantly differs from a competitor in how one component of its strategy interacts with other components, the consequences of replicating the competitor's choices about that component are harder to anticipate, making imitation less likely. We discuss how imitators' internal coordination mechanisms may help mitigate barriers to imitation arising from interdependence asymmetries and test our resulting hypotheses in the context of esports, where small teams of professional video‐game players compete in high‐stakes tournaments.Managerial SummaryWe investigate why firms observing the same competitor often imitate different aspects of that competitor’s strategy. We argue that this variation stems from each firm’s unique internal connections between activities. When a competitor’s practice is closely linked to other parts of their strategy, imitation becomes riskier if similar links do not exist in the focal firm—making imitation less likely. Using data from esports teams, where both strategic choices and coordination are observable, we show that these differences can act as barriers to imitation. However, strong communication or shared experience among decision‐makers helps overcome such barriers. Our results may caution managers against indiscriminately copying “best practices”: the highly competitive teams we studied considered not only what competitors did, but also whether those practices fit their own processes and structures.</content>

    <title>Assortment Optimization in the Presence of Focal Effect: Operational Insights and Efficient Algorithms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The assortment provided by the seller can influence customers’ evaluation of item utility. A possible consequence is that certain items in an assortment become “focal items” to customers, and customers over-evaluate their utilities. We refer to this phenomenon as thefocal effect.Kovach and Tserenjigmid (2022)recently propose a focal Luce model (FLM) to describe customers’ choices in the presence of the focal effect. The merit of the FLM lies in its flexibility to model different consumer psychology, which leads to varying choice behaviors. In this paper, we use the FLM to capture several scenarios where the focal effect occurs and consider the associated assortment optimization problems. In the first scenario, the focal effect arises from item ranking, and customers prefer items that appear at certain positions in the ranking. This scenario captures the case where customers have a preference for the cheapest items in the assortment, as well as the compromise effect. The second scenario describes the case where the focal effect exists on some predetermined items. An example of this scenario is choice overload, where customers are more likely to choose the no-purchase option when the assortment size is larger. We characterize the optimal assortment structure under each scenario and give the underlying operational insights. We find that the assortment optimization problems under these two scenarios can be solved in polynomial time with some practical assumptions. The polynomial-solvability extends even to the more challenging joint assortment and pricing optimization problems. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the FLM’s performance using both synthetic and real datasets. The results show that the FLM performs well in predicting customer choice behavior and the corresponding optimal assortment generates higher profit than benchmark assortments when the focal effect exists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Maximizing customer retention in multi-session training service: Model and algorithm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Training is an important business in the service sector. Usually, a training program involves multiple sessions and each session contains multiple activities. Although it is essential for customers to participate in all training sessions and activities, many customers fail to complete the program because the training experience is too stressful. Given the importance of customer retention in the training programs, we investigate the modeling and optimization of the retention-oriented training program design problem (RTDP), which maximizes overall service retention across all training sessions through activity scheduling. Customers make their participation decisions about their next training session based on the remembered holistic utility of past training activities. By our analysis, RTDP is a 0-1 constrained exponential sum problem (0-1 CESP), which we prove to be NP-hard. To resolve RTDP, we introduce a geometric branch and bound (GB&amp;B) algorithm that efficiently searches for the optimal solution by resolving a series of subproblems. From a numerical study, we find that higher reward, difficulty, and value lead to more U-shaped, inverted U-shaped, and increasing subsequences in each session, respectively. The reason is that higher reward favors sequences with a pleasant start and a sharp positive gradient toward the end, higher difficulty requires warm-up and cool-down, and higher value makes customers emphasize the end experience. Finally, we extend our research by investigating RTDP with session breaks and discussing the joint retention-performance optimization. When there are breaks between sessions, we find that as the break duration increases, the optimal value first increases and then decreases. For the joint retention-performance optimization, the optimal sequence is more pulsed if the service designer cares more about customer performance and flatter if the service designer cares more about customer retention.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dyadic Interactions and Patient Service Evaluation in Online Healthcare Consultations: The Role of Communication Alignment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of doctor–patient interactions on patients’ service evaluations in online medical consultations (OMCs) has received considerable attention. However, prior research has mainly focused on the individual-level and statistical features of these interactions, with limited exploration of dyad-level dynamics in doctor–patient bidirectional communication. To address this gap, this study examines both individual-level and dyad-level features of online doctor–patient interactions to understand their effects on patients’ service evaluations. We characterize doctors’ individual-level communication behaviors using the quantity and informativeness of doctors’ information acquisition and provision, and capture dyad-level features by quantifying communication alignment in doctor–patient dialogues using spectral analysis. We utilize patient gratitude as an indicator of patients’ service evaluation. Drawing on expectancy violations theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the direct and interaction effects of doctors’ communication behaviors and doctor–patient communication alignment on patient gratitude in OMCs. The model is empirically tested using a large dataset collected from a leading OMC platform in China. The analysis reveals three key findings. First, the informativeness of doctors’ information acquisition negatively affects patient gratitude, while neither the informativeness nor the quantity of information provision has a significant effect. Second, communication alignment positively influences patient gratitude. Third, communication alignment positively moderates the effects of the informativeness of both information acquisition and provision on patient gratitude. This study contributes to the literature on patients’ service evaluations, doctor–patient interactions, and communication alignment in online healthcare, and offers practical guidelines for enhancing the overall quality of online healthcare services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine traders’ order submission strategies during the Euronext preopen, which uses price-time priorities to arrange opening trades via a call auction. Preopening order submissions follow a J-shape pattern. Sophisticated proprietary traders arrive late, consistent with information leakage concerns. Slow clients arrive early and place aggressive orders to advertise their trading needs and strategically gain time priority. Their early order submissions often occur in stocks with an increase in the tick size and on days with expected liquidity shocks. They also contribute to daily price discovery. Using a preopening outage as a natural experiment, we show that the Euronext preopen improves price discovery on a rival venue. These benefits hold even in the absence of an opening auction taking place.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: Financial support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grants ANR-16-CE26-0008, ANR-17-EURE-0010 (Investissements d’Avenir program)].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03998 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the role of insurers in providing liquidity in the corporate bond market, especially during “rainy days” when the aggregate dealer inventory is positive for a relatively large fraction of the outstanding bonds. We find that, on average, life insurers have positive liquidity supply in the years following the 2007–2009 financial crisis, primarily driven by their buy-side transactions. Insurers’ corporate bond purchases improve the liquidity of transacted bonds and comparable bonds on rainy days. Using unusual weather-related losses realized in the affiliated property and casualty division as an instrumental variable, we show that corporate bonds purchased more by insurers have higher liquidity in subsequent periods.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02994 .</content>

    <title>A Tale of Two Networks: Common Ownership and Product Market Rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the welfare implications of the rise of common ownership in the United States from 1995 to 2021. We build a general equilibrium model with a hedonic demand system in which firms compete in a network game of oligopoly. Firms are connected through two large networks: the first reflects ownership overlap, the second product market rivalry. In our model, common ownership of competing firms induces unilateral incentives to soften competition and the magnitude of the common ownership effect depends on how much the two networks overlap. We estimate our model for the universe of U.S. public corporations using a combination of firm financials, investor holdings, and text-based product similarity data. We perform counterfactual calculations to evaluate how the efficiency and the distributional impact of common ownership have evolved over time. Under the assumption that firms maximize a share-weighted average of their shareholders' income, we find that the welfare cost of common ownership, measured as the ratio of deadweight loss to total surplus, has increased about ninefold between 1995 and 2021. Under alternative assumptions about corporate governance, the deadweight loss of common ownership ranges between 3.5% and 13.2% of total surplus in 2021. The rise of common ownership has also led to a significant reallocation of surplus from consumers to producers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Much of the previous research on facility networks focuses on improving the network design, but a good design alone is not sufficient to ensure smooth operations against disruption risks. This study examines an underexplored question ofwhereto invest in resilience in a facility network. Prior studies offered insights into this issue, with some scholars recommending a focus oncritical nodes, while others emphasize the importance ofcritical pathsthat are sequences of adjacent nodes and edges. Yet the node and path perspectives have not been fully integrated and optimized for facility networks. Motivated by real problems from Cainiao Network, this study reconciles the debate over node versus path and solves the problem of resilience investment to maximize expected max-flow through the network. The analysis reveals that investing in high-capacity nodes is optimal under rare disruptions, whereas investing in nodes on entire paths is best under frequent disruptions. The problem of resilience investment is in general NP-hard, but we propose greedy algorithms inspired by the node and path perspectives to provide approximate solutions with performance guarantees. Empirical analysis using operational data from Cainiao Network supports our analytical findings.</content>

    <title>Blinded versus Unblinded Review: A Field Study on the Equity of Peer-Review Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to inequities in merit-based evaluations. We tested this claim in a high-stakes field experiment comparing single-blind review (reviewer identities withheld) and double-blind review (reviewer and author identities withheld) for 530 academic conference submissions. On reliability, both processes showed moderate reliability, leading to only 40% overlap among top-rated submissions. This low overlap indicates that differences between review systems partly stem from noise in the review system. In terms of fairness, our analysis indicates that single-blind reviews favored more senior coauthors and first authors who were PhD students or research scientists while disfavoring Asian (versus White) first authors. Meanwhile, male first authors received slightly higher ratings in both conditions (especially under double-blind), but the greater the proportion of male coauthors, the lower the review ratings were under double-blind (versus single-blind). On validity, we find that for submissions accepted and presented as a talk, neither review ratings nor author characteristics predicted talk quality, number of questions, or attendance. However, review ratings from both systems similarly predicted judged poster presentation quality (for a subset of submissions) and eventual publication (for all submissions). These findings highlight limitations in both single- and double-blind approaches. Double-blind review is not a cure-all for inequities that might arise via single-blind. Yet, including author identities does not appear to enhance reliability or validity enough to justify the risks this information poses in potentially advantaging a particular individual or group.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and data analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SBE 1824259].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01646 .</content>

    <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for Human-Guided Human-Machine Interaction with Private Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the human-machine interaction such as recommending videos for improving customer engagement, we study human-guided human-machine interaction for decision making with private information. We model this interaction as a two-player turn-based game, where one player (Bob, a human) guides the other player (Alice, a machine) toward a common goal. Specifically, we focus on offline reinforcement learning (RL) in this game, where the goal is to find a policy pair for Alice and Bob that maximizes their expected total rewards based on an offline data set collected a priori. The offline setting presents two challenges: (i) We cannot collect Bob’s private information, leading to a confounding bias when using standard RL methods, and (ii) there is a distributional mismatch between the behavior policy used to collect data and the desired optimal policy we aim to learn. To tackle the confounding bias, we treat Bob’s previous action as an instrumental variable for Alice’s current decision making to adjust for the unmeasured confounding. We establish a novel identification result and propose a new off-policy evaluation (OPE) method for evaluating policy pairs in this two-player turn-based game. To tackle the distributional mismatch, we leverage the idea of pessimism and use our OPE method to develop an off-policy policy learning algorithm for finding a desirable policy pair for both Alice and Bob. Moreover, we prove that under some technical assumptions, the policy pair obtained through our method converges to the optimal one at a satisfactory rate. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.This paper was accepted by Nicolas Stier for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: L.

    <title>The Benefits of Delay to Online Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Real-time decisions are usually irrevocable in many contexts of online decision making. One common practice is delaying real-time decisions so that the decision maker can gather more information to make better decisions. For example, in online retailing, there is typically a time delay between when an online order is received and when it gets picked and assembled for shipping. However, decisions cannot be delayed forever. In this paper, we study this fundamental trade-off and aim to theoretically characterize the benefits of delaying real-time decisions. We provide a theoretical foundation for a broad family of online decision-making problems by proving that the gap between our proposed online algorithm (called “delayed Bayesian prophet”) and the offline optimal hindsight policy decays exponentially fast in the length of delay. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments on the benefits of delay, using both synthetic data and publicly available real data. Both our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate an important managerial insight: a little delay is all we need. Finally, we extend our analysis and results to the setting where the arrival distribution is independent but nonidentical, the setting where the arrival distribution is unknown, and the setting where decisions are made in batches.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The second author was partially funded by a grant from Amazon.com Inc., awarded through collaboration with the Columbia Center of AI Technology.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00549 .</content>

    <title>Income Pools for Superstar Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Superstar” markets, where a small portion of individuals earn disproportionately high incomes, are common in fields like entrepreneurship, sports, and entertainment. Participants in these markets face significant income uncertainty, which can deter entry or prompt early exit. To address this difficulty, we propose income pools: contracts where individuals agree to share a portion of future earnings with pool members if a specific salary milestone is achieved. To date, hundreds of income pool contracts have been signed in practice. This paper develops the first mathematical model to analyze such contracts, focusing on stability (i.e., pools where no agents leave or join). When constrained to creating a single pool, we show that a stable pool always exists with specific structural properties. Generally, stronger agents tend to be more “collaborative” and favor larger pools, whereas weaker agents are more “selfish” and prefer smaller pools. Next, we analyze pools that adhere to a maximum size (mirroring current practice) and show that stability persists. These pools typically require more weaker agents than strong ones and we find an interesting “Pareto dominance” result, whereby all agents in a stable pool prefer a particular unique stable pool. Finally, we study general partition structures, prove that a stable partition always exists under certain conditions, and provide an algorithm to construct such a partition. We conclude with a case study on data from 2,000 professional baseball players to demonstrate a 20%–30% increase in social welfare if players join income pools, under varying contract parameters.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: T.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The positive role of transformational leadership for productivity and mental well-being has long been established. Transformational leadership behavior may be particularly suited to navigate times of crisis that are characterized by high levels of complexity and uncertainty. We exploit quasi-random assignment of employees to managers and study the role of frontline managers’ leadership styles on employees’ performance, work style, and mental well-being in times of crisis. Using longitudinal administrative data and panel survey data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that the benefits of different leadership styles depend on the environment: Employees of more transactional managers outperform those of more transformational leaders before the onset of the pandemic. During the pandemic, however, more transformational managers lead employees to better performance and mental well-being. We discuss potential explanations and implications.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, Behavioral Economics and Decision Analysis.Funding: K. Czura and F.

    <title>Do Option Characteristics Predict the Underlying Stock Returns in the Cross-Section?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive analysis of option-implied information for predicting the cross-section of stock returns. Based on large sets of firm and option characteristics and using traditional portfolio sorts and modern high-dimensional methods, we find that option information matters. However, in contrast to existing studies, there are only a few option characteristics that have significant incremental predictive power after controlling for the large set of firm characteristics. Further analysis reveals that the strongest option characteristics are associated with asset mispricing, future tail return realizations, and short-selling costs. Our findings are consistent with models of informed trading and limits to arbitrage.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: R. T.

    <title>The Effect of a System for Sharing Best Practices Within Pre-Existing Peer Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer networks, such as enterprise social networks (ESNs), can facilitate knowledge transfer across employees. However, such systems can also lead to information overload or difficulty in finding useful information. We examine data from a natural field experiment where a retailer introduced a system for sharing best practices (SSBP) in an existing online peer network, a control mechanism that enables easy access to well-organized best practices from high-performing units. The SSBP did not have a significant immediate or average effect on sales, however it significantly increased the sales trends of the stores where it was implemented. Sales improvement was greatest in stores that (a) perceived higher information overload from the online peer network before the intervention, or (b) had lower exposure to offline peers. The SSBP led to an increase, rather than decrease, of voluntary interstore knowledge sharing in the online peer network. These findings shed light on how a formal mechanism for sharing best practices can enhance the decision-facilitating role of relevant information without discouraging spontaneous knowledge sharing within the existing peer networks.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00990 .</content>

    <title>Guaranteed Demand and Corporate R&amp;amp;D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. government incentivizes firms to develop innovative technologies by awarding research and development (R&amp;D) contracts that often carry an implicit promise of “guaranteed demand.” Firms that demonstrate strong technological capabilities are rewarded with noncompetitive production contracts for the resulting products and services. Using newly assembled data on $4.2 trillion in government procurement contracts from all federal agencies, matched to U.S. publicly traded firms, we document a “crowding-in” effect, where government R&amp;D contracts lead to increased investment in corporate scientific research. This effect is concentrated in large, vertically integrated firms and limited to upstream R&amp;D. We argue that these patterns are best explained by a guaranteed demand mechanism: Firms co-invest in upstream research when success offers a credible path to future noncompetitive production contracts. We develop a theoretical framework to explain when it is optimal for the government to bundle R&amp;D and production contracts. Our analysis shows that guaranteed demand can produce higher quality at a lower total cost for upstream R&amp;D projects when the R&amp;D firms have production capabilities. Our empirical results support these predictions. Additionally, we find that the crowding-in effect has weakened over time as the government has increasingly decoupled R&amp;D contracts from production contracts. We discuss the potential implications of this decoupling.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: Financial support from the Alfred P.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I test whether asset prices reflect risk exposures of financial intermediaries in a setting well-suited to tackling concerns about omitted risk factors. I analyze catastrophe bonds whose cash flows are linked to natural disasters and find that 71% of the security-level variation in expected returns can be explained by a theoretically motivated measure of intermediaries’ marginal utility. Assuming natural disasters are independent of aggregate wealth, this result is inconsistent with any alternative explanation based on unobserved macroeconomic risks. In addition, the aggregate premium decreases and becomes less sensitive to the occurrence of disasters when intermediaries’ access to outside capital improves.</content>

    <title>What Drives Risky Prescription Opioid Use? Evidence from Migration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and estimate a dynamic model of risky prescription opioid use that allows us to unpack the role of person- and place-specific drivers of the opioid epidemic and to assess the impact of state opioid policies. Event studies indicate that, among adults receiving federal disability insurance from 2006 to 2019, moves to states with higher rates of risky use produce an immediate jump in the probability of risky use, followed by an additional gradual increase for the next several years. Using a potential outcomes framework, we show how these results map to the person- and place-specific factors in the model. Model estimates imply large effects of place on both the likelihood of transitioning to addiction and the availability of prescription opioids; they also indicate that these place effects change significantly when state laws restricting pain clinics are enacted. A one standard deviation reduction in all place effects would have reduced risky use by about 40 percent over our study period. One particular source of place effects, pain clinic laws, reduced risky use by 5 percent, but could have reduced it by 30 percent if they had been enacted earlier, with much of this magnification operating through the dynamics of addiction.</content>

    <title>Conviction, Incarceration, and Recidivism: Understanding the Revolving Door</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Noncarceral conviction is a common outcome of criminal court cases: for every individual incarcerated, there are approximately three who were recently convicted but not sentenced to prison or jail. We extend the binary-treatment judge IV framework to settings with multiple treatments and use it to study the consequences of noncarceral conviction. We outline assumptions under which widely-used 2SLS regressions recover margin-specific treatment effects, relate these assumptions to models of judge decision-making, and derive an expression that provides intuition about the direction and magnitude of asymptotic bias when a key assumption on judge decision-making is not met. We find that noncarceral conviction (relative to dismissal) leads to a large and long-lasting increase in recidivism for felony defendants in Virginia. In contrast, incarceration (relative to noncarceral conviction) leads to a short-run reduction in recidivism, consistent with incapacitation. Our empirical results suggest that noncarceral felony conviction is an important and overlooked driver of recidivism.</content>

    <title>Fragile Interpersonal Relationship in Tacit Knowledge Sharing: How Workplace Friendship Fails Under Competition and Functional Similarity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the competitive landscape of modern business, tacit knowledge (TK) sharing has emerged as a critical enabler of innovation and transformation, particularly within the realm of operations management. In this context, the efficient flow of TK is essential for optimizing processes, promoting technology development, and sustaining competitive advantage. While the role of workplace friendship in facilitating TK sharing has been well-documented, there is a common misconception that close personal relationships alone suffice for effective knowledge transfer. However, in the complex dynamics of operational environments, these relationships can be unexpectedly fragile and prone to disruption. Even employees with strong workplace friendships may encounter inevitable challenges such as competition over limited resources, conflicts of interest, and diminished incremental benefits of knowledge exchange among functionally overlapping colleagues. Grounded in social information processing (SIP) theory, this study proposes a moderated mediation model and explores the negative moderating effects of competitive climate and functional similarity on the relationship between workplace friendship and TK sharing and how these factors subsequently impact innovation performance. Through a mixed-method design, including a main field study and a supplementary experiment involving 1,809 participants across various industries, our findings underscore that the positive association between workplace friendship and TK sharing will be diminished or even dissolved when employees perceive higher levels of competitive climate and functional similarity. By adopting a SIP perspective, this research elucidates how contextual factors in operational environments can overshadow the influence of workplace friendship on TK sharing. It also reveals the intricate interplay (i.e., mutual reinforcement) between the attitudes of TK holders and recipients, which is crucial for ensuring the seamless exchange of knowledge that drives operational excellence in highly competitive workplaces. These insights are vital for operations managers aiming to cultivate workforce diversity, regulate peer competition, inspire employee enthusiasm and engagement, and initiate cross-functional technology development projects. Such strategies foster effective and sustainable TK sharing, ultimately contributing to superior innovation performance in operational settings.</content>

    <title>Improving Transparency and Verifiability in School Admissions: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Students participating in centralized admissions procedures do not typically have access to the information used to determine their matched school, such as other students’ preferences or school priorities. This can lead to doubts about whether their matches were computed correctly (the “verifiability problem”) or, at a deeper level, whether the promised admissions procedure was even used (the “transparency problem”). In a model that spans many popular applications, we show how these problems can be addressed by providing appropriate feedback to students without disclosing sensitive information like other students’ preferences or school priorities. In particular, we show that the verifiability problem can be solved by (1) publicly communicating “cutoffs” (the minimum scores required to be eligible for each school) or (2) using “single-school” preference elicitation procedures that convey rich “experiential” information. In our main result, we show that the transparency problem can be solved by using cutoffs and single-school elicitation procedures together. We find strong support for these solutions in a laboratory experiment and show how they can be implemented for popular school admissions applications involving top trading cycles, and deferred and immediate acceptance.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [Project 100018_207722].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent regulatory discussions concentrate on the role institutional investors play in the financial sector. We investigate the determinants and consequences of institutional ownership (IO) in banks. Our findings suggest that institutional owners invest more in banks that have a lower proportion of consumer and real estate loans; are less opaque; have a lower level of insider control; are larger, older, and more capitalized; and have lower stock return volatility. In contrast, banks’ funding characteristics, loan risk appetite, and connectedness with other banks do not seem to be relevant factors in institutional investors’ decisions to hold a bank. We further investigate whether IO is related to tail risk comovement and changes in bank operations. We find robust evidence suggesting that IO is positively associated with a bank’s future tail risk and that the association between IO and tail risk is significantly higher for banks than it is for nonfinancial firms. We also find that this relationship is stronger for banks during economic downturns. Correspondingly, we find that there is a greater reduction in lending growth and greater increases in opacity and risk taking during recessionary periods for banks with higher levels of IO. Our results suggest that institutions with low monitoring incentives in particular play a role in increasing tail risk comovement and in the deleterious real effects of IO. Lastly, we find evidence suggesting that disclosure may play a role in mitigating the relationship between IO and tail risk comovement.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02522 .</content>

    <title>A social influence view of the internationalization of cultural products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A thriving international cultural industry fuels the expansion of the global creative economy. Yet, what drives the international diffusion and performance of cultural products? This study adopts a social influence perspective to examine the international performance of film exports, addressing a critical gap in existing research that often isolates social influences without considering the impact of their (in)congruence. Given the subjective nature of cultural products and their vulnerability to multiple influences across global value chains, we theorize and empirically test the effects of congruence and incongruence between supply-side and demand-side social influences on films’ international performance. Analyzing 1676 U.S. films released between 2009 and 2018, our findings reveal that congruence between supply-side and demand-side social influences significantly enhances a film’s appeal, credibility, and international success. Moreover, this effect is amplified by two key moderators across global value chains, namely, upstream home-country adoption of social media promotion and downstream host-country press freedom. This study contributes to the understanding of the social influence view within global value chains by highlighting the importance of supply-demand congruence and the contextual factors that shape their effectiveness in driving the international performance of cultural products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops an empirical methodology for extracting pricing factors from investor portfolio data. We apply this approach to the stockholdings of Norwegian individual investors from 1997 to 2017. A two‐factor model, featuring the market portfolio and a long‐short portfolio constructed from the holdings of investors sorted by age or wealth, explains both the common variation in portfolio holdings and the cross section of stock returns. Portfolio tilts toward the long‐short investor factor correlate with indebtedness, macroeconomic exposure, gender, and investment experience. Our paper illustrates the benefits of using holdings data for explaining the risk premia of financial assets.</content>

    <title>Digital Bricolage and Its Limits: How Microenterprises Undertake Digitalization in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Small enterprises are under pressure to change and digitalize. Many have had to reimagine how they use digital technology to do business. Our research suggests that for microenterprises, digitalization can be an organic form of development, driven by making do with the digital resources at hand rather than a deliberate strategy that prioritizes investment in complex digital technology. Harnessing the potential of this could accelerate the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal to increase access to value chains and markets for small enterprises in developing countries. Our findings offer evidence for policymakers to rethink conventional strategies and develop more context-sensitive support mechanisms that reflect how digitalization actually unfolds in resource-limited settings. For information systems and management education research, the empirical study theorizes digitalization from an alternative perspective that is less emphasized in current literature. It considers the reality of many resource-limited business ventures around the world and their need to “make do.” This contrasts with the prevailing emphasis on cutting-edge technology in existing literature and case studies. By spotlighting the emergent, adaptive, and often improvised nature of small enterprise digitalization, this work invites a rethinking of how we teach, study, and support digital innovation in diverse global contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Divergent viewpoints have been shared regarding “return to office” mandates, which have aimed to reverse trends toward increased remote work. Employees affected by such recent mandates have generally reacted unfavorably, in many instances deciding to leave their organization, or in other instances withdrawing efforts. A recent trend that has been discussed as related to this issue is “quiet quitting”, which in part refers to withholding extra effort beyond satisfying minimum job requirements. Drawing from Self‐Determination Theory and Psychological Contract Theory, we investigated work arrangements that may foster different work outcomes, including behaviors associated with quiet quitting, such as neglect, reduced voice, and reduced citizenship behavior. Specifically, we examined differences in employee attitudes and behaviors as a function of three work modalities, including (1) fully in‐person, (2) fully remote, and (3) hybrid work. Results generally indicated more favorable outcomes for employees in a hybrid modality compared with in‐person or remote roles.</content>

    <title>Exploring Coworker Perceptions of and Reactions to Quiet Quitting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting is a relatively new phenomenon that has quickly caught the attention of both practitioners and academics. With the world of work becoming increasingly interconnected, we contribute to the discourse by approaching quiet quitting from the novel perspective of understanding how others in the workplace perceive those who engage in quiet quitting. To do so, we first provide a formalized definition of quiet quitting and differentiate coworkers' perceptions of quiet quitting from similar psychological constructs (Studies 1–3). We then examine employee responses to coworkers engaging in quiet quitting with a qualitative study (Study 4) and vignette design (Study 5), finding that as an employee's perception of coworker quiet quitting increases, supportive behaviors decrease and workplace incivility behaviors towards the coworker increase. The effect on workplace incivility behaviors is moderated by self‐rated quiet quitting, such that employees who had higher self‐rated quiet quitting were more likely to engage in incivility towards a coworker regardless of whether their coworker was quiet quitting. Overall, by exploring quiet quitting observed by a coworker, we provide a different perspective on this construct and extend past research to show how employees feel about and react to a coworker's quiet quitting behaviors.</content>

    <title>THE ECONOMICS OF SPATIAL MOBILITY: THEORY AND EVIDENCE USING SMARTPHONE DATA</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable quantitative framework for modelling the rich patterns of spatial mobility observed in smartphone data. We show that travel is frequently undertaken as part of a travel itinerary, defined as a journey starting and ending at home that can include more than one intermediate stop on a given day. We show that these travel itineraries provide microfoundations for consumption externalities and generate both complementarity and substitutability between locations. We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to WFH. We find that these consumption externalities are key drivers of the agglomeration of economic activity in central cities and shape the relative welfare gains from alternative transport improvements in favor of investments in central cities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reaping IT Externality Benefits across Business Units in Multibusiness Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The indirect productivity gains related to information technology (IT), known as IT externalities, in inter-firm contexts have been extensively studied. However, the impact of IT investments within a business unit (BU) of a multibusiness firm on the productivity of other BUs remains unclear. Additionally, the conditions that facilitate such intra-firm externalities are not well understood. Research on resource externalities within multibusiness firms typically focuses on capacity-sharing benefits, where unused capacity in one unit can be utilized by another. IT resources, however, often lack capacity-sharing potential due to their full utilization or contractual limitations. Despite this, IT resources can generate non-rivalrous intangibles, such as internally-developed applications, expertise, and consulting know-how, which can be shared within the firm to create externalities.This study investigates whether IT centralization (ITC), as a vertical coordination mechanism, is effective in harnessing IT externality potential arising from IT portfolio similarities (ITPS), a form of horizontal coordination, across BUs. Utilizing data from 8,374 unique units within 866 firms from 2005 to 2020, we find that BUs must meet two conditions—higher ITPS and higher levels of ITC—to realize greater intra-firm IT externality benefits. Furthermore, these benefits accrue from IT investments made by units with a sufficient number of IT employees. Interestingly, BUs with limited access to IT employees gain more from pooled IT investments. Our findings suggest that concurrent vertical and horizontal coordination, along with access to human talent for creating knowledge, code, and expertise from digital resources, are crucial for maximizing digital resource externalities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Mixed Appointment Scheduling: Managing Routine and Same-Day Appointments for Outpatient Clinics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces a novel scheduling approach for managing a mix of routine and same-day appointments in an outpatient clinic. While the well-known carve-out scheduling (COS) policy reserves the provider capacity for same-day patients, its use of dedicated slots for each patient class may increase the risk of system underutilization or overload and long patient wait times. We propose the mixed appointment scheduling (MAS) policy, which allows routine and same-day patients to share common appointment slots, and investigate its performance relative to COS. By formulating a new model to determine the optimal scheduling decisions under the MAS policy, we demonstrate that the problem’s objective function (the total daily cost) is no longer multimodular in the presence of priority service discipline and demand uncertainty. We develop efficient methods to identify optimal scheduling policies and show that MAS reduces system costs, improves utilization, and decreases delays, particularly when same-day demand is moderate relative to clinic capacity.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Priority Patient Transfer Under Ambulance Offload Delay</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ambulance offload delays (AODs) occur when emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are unable to promptly transfer patients to overwhelmed emergency departments. These delays postpone necessary care for the patient and hinder the EMS system from attending to new emergencies. This study introduces a real-time multi-priority patient transfer policy aimed at reducing these delays. We model the patient transfer problem as a stochastic dynamic program based on post-decision states, and develop approximate dynamic programming approaches to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we derive a lower bound for the optimal solution through information relaxation. We evaluate the proposed method using both synthetic and real EMS data from St. Paul, Minnesota. Our solution is close to the lower bound, and the resulting policy results in a triple-win situation. For patients, our policy reduces hospital wait times by 80%; for hospitals, our policy alleviates emergency department congestion, and we find that even partial compatibility leads to notable system-wide improvements; for the EMS system, ambulance utilization is reduced by more than 30%, and ambulances could handle more calls per day, with a reduction in lost calls exceeding 80%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimal Trading with Flexible Speed-Dependent Transaction CostsTransaction cost rates (TCRs) implied by most limit order books (LOBs) display irregular functional forms in trading speeds, making it difficult to fit them using the TCR functions proposed in prior studies. In “Optimal Trading with Speed-Dependent Transaction Cost Rates: A Flexible Framework,” Liu, Qian, and Xu develop a workhorse model to study optimal trade execution with general TCR functions. The piecewise linear TCR function form in the model can approximate any TCR functions. The authors characterize important features of the optimal trading strategy. The model simultaneously generates order-shredding and U-shape trading patterns for large required trades. In addition, the authors demonstrate that implementing common naive trading strategies, such as trading all the position instantly, or at a constant speed, or incorrectly assuming linear TCR function, can be costly.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the relation between individual analysts’ exclusions that result in lower street earnings per share (EPS) forecasts than their EPS forecasts based on generally accepted accounting principles (i.e., EPS-decreasing exclusions) and the optimism of their target price forecasts. We document that analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions from their annual forecasts mainly relate to positive nonrecurring items already reported by the firm. We find that analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions are associated with more optimistic target prices. Our results also suggest that analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions contribute to the optimism in their target prices by enabling analysts to project higher earnings growth. Further analyses reveal that the relation between analysts’ EPS-decreasing exclusions and target price optimism is attributable, at least in part, to analysts’ strategic incentives for issuing favorable valuations.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Service robots on organizational frontlines, notably in health and elderly care settings, promise to tackle staff shortages. In such service contexts, compliance is crucial for consumer well-being, but compliance with robot advice remains problematically low. This research explores how the source of robot advice affects compliance in human-robot interactions. In six studies, including four field studies with real human-robot interactions, the authors demonstrate that consumers are more likely to comply with advice given by a robot service provider when the source of advice is a human rather than the robot itself. This is because a human source of robot advice increases the feeling of accountability, or the expectation that one might need to justify one’s actions to others, which is more difficult to achieve with only robot social presence. In turn, this fosters advice adherence, which also persists over time across repeated interactions. However, when the robot embeds social cues in the advice, the difference in accountability and compliance between robot-only and robot advice with a human source attenuates. These insights hold enormous promise, especially for health care practitioners, institutions, and consumers for whom increased compliance can lead to better health outcomes, reduced hospital readmissions, improved recovery, and elevated well-being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;…is ”should I buy any?”. Under Bayesian portfolio theory, ongoing zero weights in cryptocurrency are surprisingly difficult to generate. With ten years of prior data, equity investors would need very pessimistic priors on mean returns to never buy cryptocurrency: -10.6% per month for Bitcoin, and -19.6% for a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. Most priors that involve never purchasing cryptocurrency imply shorting it. Optimal weights are generally small, non-trivial (1-5% magnitude), frequently positive, and smooth. The certainty equivalent gains from cryptocurrency are comparable to international diversification and prominent anomaly portfolios. Costs (storage, fees) would need to exceed 21-39% annually to deter trading.</content>
