    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With increasing public attention to corporate sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) controversies emerging in global supply chains present a growing problem for multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper investigates whether MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers are more likely to be exposed to supplier-related ESG controversies. It also explores structural characteristics of global supply chains that can mitigate MNEs’ exposure to such controversies. Building on the literature on supply chain complexity and small-world networks, we suggest that the small-worldness of an MNE’s supply chain network can mitigate the impact of the geographical dispersion of suppliers on supplier-induced ESG controversies. Our analysis of the Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies from 2010 to 2019 reveals that MNEs with geographically dispersed suppliers suffer from more supplier-induced ESG controversies, while small-worldness attenuates such impact. Our findings contribute to the international business literature by highlighting small-worldness as a network structural characteristic that can be deployed by MNEs to mitigate the negative impacts of supply chain spatial complexity.</content>

    <title>Real Effects of Non‐Streamlined Sales Tax Administration: Evidence from the Florida Hotel Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether the local administration of sales taxes (as opposed to a more streamlined state administration) affects the real economy for businesses complying with the tax. We study this question in the Florida hotel industry, as counties in Florida can choose to locally administer the county‐level tourist tax or have the state administer the county‐level tax along with the state‐level tourist tax. Local administration is popular because it supports local employment (of tax administrators) and provides more stringent enforcement on non‐commercial operators (e.g., private rentals). State administration, however, has fewer compliance costs for hotels (e.g., reduced filings and fewer audits). Commentary from the profession suggests the incremental compliance costs of local administration can be considerable. We find that counties switching from state to local administration of tourist taxes is associated with slower growth in aggregate hotel payroll and employment, consistent with local tax administration increasing compliance costs to the point that affected businesses cut other services.</content>

    <title>Changing tracks: How status affects category shifts in the Korean popular music industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how producers' status shapes their strategies for category shifting of their artists. Unlike prior research emphasizing its limitations, we argue that in creative industries, category shifting can offer substantial advantages. Focusing on producer‐driven markets, we propose that middle‐status producers align artists with market‐dominant categories, while high‐status ones pursue periodic radical shifts. However, for female artists, producers' influence on category shifts is constrained by audience expectations rooted in stricter institutional gender norms. Using a unique dataset from the Korean popular music industry, we find support for our hypotheses. We show that entertainment agencies' status influences the category‐shifting behaviors of idol groups. Yet, the impact of producer status is moderated by the broader gender expectations in which the artists are embedded.Managerial SummaryThis study explores how producers' status influences their approach to positioning their artists within existing market categories. Contrary to previous views focusing largely on limitations, we argue that category shifting in creative industries can bring significant benefits. In markets where producers drive the creative process, we suggest that those with moderate status tend to shift to follow popular categories, while high‐status ones opt for more radical changes. However, female artists face tighter constraints due to institutional norms. Drawing from data in the Korean popular music industry, we find evidence supporting our theory. We demonstrate how the status of entertainment agencies affects the category shifts of idol groups, though this effect is limited by broader gender expectations surrounding the artists.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Seat Selection Surcharge and Allocation Policy in Selling High-Speed Train Tickets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a dynamic capacity control problem with seat selection and dynamic surcharge in the railway industry. In such problems, passenger arrives with a request for an itinerary, having a seat preference and a certain willingness-to-pay for seat preference. The decision-maker needs to decide at each time period whether to open each itinerary, a surcharge for each seat type in each open itinerary, and a seat assignment for each accepted request. The distinguishing feature of this problem is that the seat assignment decision is closely related to the surcharge decision — if the passenger chooses to pay the surcharge, then we must assign him/her a seat of preference, otherwise we can assign the passenger any seat on the train. Moreover, each accepted passenger must be assigned to a unique seat throughout the journey and it is not allowed to use a combination of seats to serve a passenger.We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem involving seat allocation and dynamic surcharge pricing. We consider a static problem in which demands of all requests are known but their arrival periods are unknown, and introduce a set of assignment consistency constraints to ensure the feasibility of opening and surcharge decisions when willingness-to-pay is uncertain. We then propose dynamic policies based on the static problem. In particular, we propose a booking limit control policy, two bid-price control policies and a re-solving a dynamic primal policy, and study the asymptotic loss of these policies. We also conduct numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of proposed policies and the potential gain of setting dynamic surcharges.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving Health Outcomes with Less Cost? Provision of Mobile Clinic in Developing Economies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consider a public healthcare system consisting of a hospital, a mobile clinic (MC), and a population of potential patients. The government is concerned about the system’s healthcare spending and the population’s health outcomes. It decides the frequency and capacity of the MC service to maximize the social welfare that consists of two terms: the system’s long-run average healthcare cost and the population’s average quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We characterize the population’s natural disease progression using a Markov cohort model and derive the average healthcare cost incurred for the system and the average QALY in closed form for a given MC service. We show that the government is more likely to provide the MC service when (i) it puts more weight on the population’s average QALY, (ii) the MC treatment becomes more efficient, or (iii) the hospital treatment cost is much higher relative to the MC treatment cost. We further show that when conditions (ii) and (iii) are met or the disease progresses faster, the provision of the MC service is more likely to result in a win-win outcome, leading to both healthcare cost reduction and QALY improvement. The optimal MC delivery policy highly hinges on the disease’s progressive speed. Specifically, when the MC service is designated to serve a specific target population, once the MC service is provided, it shall be provided either every period or every other period if the disease is fast-progressive. If the disease is slow-progressive, the long-run average healthcare cost exhibits a zigzag pattern with the MC delivery cycle when the relative treatment cost-saving per person induced by the provision of the MC service is positive. Last, we conduct a real case study. Our analysis reveals that the optimal implementation of the MC program results in a 119.5% improvement in QALY and a 5% reduction in healthcare costs. The results are robust in probabilistic sensitivity analysis with a relative performance gap within 11.5% when factoring in uncertainty of the parameters.</content>

    <title>Transaction Fee Mechanisms and User Welfare in Permissionless Blockchains</title>
    <updated>2025-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A transaction fee is fundamental in maintaining the stability and decentralization of a permissionless blockchain, the infrastructure underlying major cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. This fee, set and paid by users when initiating each transaction, aggregates to over $24 million daily on Ethereum, imposing a nontrivial barrier to wider adoption. What is worse is that it is disproportionately borne by small users. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum started with a name-your-own-price style fee mechanism. Under this Legacy mechanism, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, only three-quarters of the transaction fee is necessary for users to attain the service quality they receive; the remaining one-quarter thus constitutes welfare loss. In August 2021, Ethereum implemented a fee mechanism change. Together, the Legacy methods and the new scheme, which we call Cap-Tip, describe the two most widely used fee mechanisms in all major permissionless blockchains. We explain the innovations embedded in the Cap-Tip mechanism through the lens of information quality and task decomposition. Collecting over 123 million transactions covering the change period, we estimate the causal impact of Cap-Tip on welfare improvement using a doubly robust difference-in-difference estimator that accommodates heterogeneity across timing of and exposure after adoption. The result is an astounding 80% reduction in welfare loss, achieved by users only 6 days after adoption. Interestingly, we also find that adoption benefits small users more than large ones, alleviating fee disparity and improving fairness. We theorize this difference through user experience and the overconfidence bias. Our study offers a novel operational perspective to unpack how the arguably most significant fee mechanism change in the blockchain space affects user welfare.</content>

    <title>Nested Set-Covering/Packing Problem: Degeneracy Alleviation and Dual Stabilization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stabilize the Dual Value and Alleviate the Primal Degeneracy of Linear Programs SimultaneouslyDual-optimal and deep dual-optimal inequalities (DOIs/DDOIs) are known to aid dual stabilization and accelerate convergence. In “Nested Set-Covering/Packing Problem: Degeneracy Alleviation and Dual Stabilization,” Siqi Guo, Fan Xiao, and Zhe Liang observe that DOIs/DDOIs also increase primal degeneracy, thereby extra effort is needed to prove optimality. Therefore, when addressing linear programs, it is critical to stabilize the dual as well as reduce primal degeneracy. This paper studies a nested multistage set-covering problem and proposes a nested set-covering model, which can be viewed as a traditional set-covering problem with special DDOIs. The authors derive strengthened reduced costs that can prescreen and prune degenerate variables and a pruning-and-pricing mechanism that utilizes both standard and strengthened reduced costs to price out promising variables. An efficient nested column-and-row generation algorithm is developed to exploit the benefits of both dual stabilization and degeneracy alleviation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Middle-Mile E-Commerce Order FulfillmentIn “E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Problem with Limited Time Window,” Zhou, Gümüş, and Miao investigate how online retailers can improve order fulfillment by utilizing the limited fulfillment window in middle-mile logistics. The authors first characterize an optimal policy and then, introduce two simple heuristic approaches for fulfillment decisions based on Lagrangian relaxation. They show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal when the number of demand locations increases. They also discover that integrating the information about remaining fulfillment windows into the decision-making process can yield additional benefits. Their findings suggest that online retailers can gain a competitive advantage by offering customers options, such as a “two-day fulfillment” service instead of a “same-day fulfillment” service, particularly when faced with limited logistical capacities.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: It Takes One to Buy but Two to Say Goodbye: Asymmetrical Preference for Others’ Involvement in Product Decisions across the Customer Journey</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What influences consumers to make product decisions alone versus with household partners? This research examines how consumers’ preference for solo or joint decision-making with household partners varies between product acquisition and disposal stages. Ten pre-registered studies demonstrate that for many household products, consumers are more likely to choose joint (vs. solo) decision-making with household partners for disposal than for acquisition. This asymmetry occurs because disposal (vs. acquisition) increases perceptions of the potential for infringement on a household partner’s rights, which increases the desire for clarity about a partner’s product valuation and thus the choice of joint (vs. solo) decision-making with one’s partner. The authors identify three process-consistent boundary conditions, wherein this acquisition-disposal asymmetry is mitigated: (1) when the product cannot be used by one’s partner, (2) when considering decisions with non-household members (e.g., non-cohabitating close friends) instead of one’s household partner, and (3) when the product’s price exceeds the household’s typical budget. Moreover, the authors discuss implications of this acquisition-disposal asymmetry for consumer well-being and marketing strategies, including its potential to cause delays in disposal decisions relative to acquisition decisions. This research contributes to understanding household decision dynamics and identifies a novel contributor to overaccumulation of household products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Package weight and calorie judgments play an important role in food-related consumer decisions. In this paper, the authors hypothesize and demonstrate that the bi-directional relationship between package stability and objective weight leads consumers to perceive visually more stable shapes as subjectively heavier: the “shape stability effect” (Study 1). The stability effect is mitigated (replicated) when the context makes volume (weight) judgments more accessible than weight (volume) judgments (Study 2). The shape stability effect has consequences for calorie perceptions (Study 3A) and consumption decisions (Study 3B). We also examined the implications for consumers’ WTP (Study 4A). Analysis of an archival data set (Study 4B) shows that for tasty (healthy) products, price is positively (negatively) associated with shape stability. Theoretically, these results add to the literature on volume and weight judgments, and calorie perceptions. Managerial implications for food packaging and positioning are offered.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Benefits from Alternative Data for Credit Scoring? Evidence from Peru</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion individuals worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to credit due to the absence of traditional credit scores. In this paper, we demonstrate how retail transaction data can be used to construct an alternative credit score, potentially expanding credit access for these individuals. Our study utilizes a unique dataset obtained through a partnership with a Peruvian company. We merge customer loyalty data and credit card repayment data with administrative records from the Peruvian financial system, which provide detailed financial histories of individuals. This comprehensive dataset allows us to construct credit scores for individuals both with and without a credit history. Through simulations of credit card approval decisions, we find that incorporating retail data increases approval rates for individuals without a credit history, from 16% to between 31% and 48%. In contrast, for those with an established credit history, approval rates remain largely unchanged at around 88%. We investigate why retail data particularly benefits individuals without a credit history and discuss the broader implications of this credit scoring methodology for consumers, firms, and policymakers. Our findings highlight its potential to transform credit access for millions of previously unbanked individuals.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Self-Preferencing on Digital Platforms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms facilitate exchanges between platform actors, such as trading between buyers and sellers. However, providers of digital platforms also compete with other actors, referred to as third parties, on their own platforms. In such settings,self-preferencingcan occur if the platform treats its own offerings better than comparable third-party offerings—a practice often deemed inappropriate. However, detecting self-preferencing is challenging. This article addresses this challenge conceptually and empirically by putting forward a conceptual framework that defines self-preferencing and conceptualizes two self-preferencing tests. It implements this framework empirically in two studies across three international Amazon marketplaces using a novel metric to measure a product’s non-personalized visibility. The aggregate findings provide little evidence for self-preferencing in both studies. However, the more disaggregated findings at a country- and product category-level vary from weak self-preferencing to strong self-depreferencing. As implementing self-preferencing tests requires researchers to choose between several empirical alternatives and assumptions, the approach proposed herein includes extensive sensitivity, specification curve, and heterogeneity analyses whose results support the robustness of the findings.</content>

    <title>Gaining Career Purpose Through Lightning Bolts: Examining the Strength and Psychological Foundations of Work-Related Epiphanies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Epiphanies—sudden realizations that transform how people see themselves—have the potential to infuse people’s personal and professional lives with a renewed sense of purpose. Yet, the prominence and potency of epiphanies as purpose-giving vehicles has largely been overlooked in management and organization studies. In the research reported here, we investigate epiphanies and their psychological foundations. Specifically, we build and test theory on what types of individuals, psychologically speaking, are more likely to experience epiphanies of greater strength related to their work and careers. We evaluate the strength of the work-related epiphanies that people experienced over the course of their lives (Study 1) and in the context of a leadership development program (Study 2) and a leadership coaching workshop (Study 3). Consistent with our theorizing, we find that people who engage in a form of mind wandering known as “problem-solving daydreaming” are more likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength. Furthermore, we find that people who engage in problem-solving daydreaming are especially likely to experience work-related epiphanies of greater strength when they possess a form of curiosity that compels them to solve their problems (“deprivation sensitivity”). Work-related epiphany strength, in turn, transmits this conditional effect onto people’s sense of purpose in their careers via psychological tension resolution. These results illuminate psychological phenomena underlying sudden shifts in how people view themselves and open new windows into how a heightened sense of career purpose can emerge among individuals on a managerial career path.</content>

    <title>Global ecological dependence and multinationals’ climate innovation: the role of climate risk exposure and institutional conditions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change poses significant global challenges to multinational enterprises (MNEs). One crucial solution hinges on the development of new technologies to mitigate climate change or adapt to its adverse effects. However, it remains unclear what factors can effectively motivate MNEs’ development of climate innovation. Integrating the resource dependence theory and the natural resource-based view, we argue that MNEs’ strategies are shaped by their dependence on the global ecological environment for natural resources—coined here asglobal ecological dependence. When exposed to elevated climate risks, MNEs tend to engage in climate innovation to assuage the uncertainty associated with their global ecological dependence. This tendency is moderated by climate-related formal and informal institutions that alter the perceived benefits and costs of climate innovation: stringent regulatory demand for climate action weakens this tendency as it increases firm costs and can divert resources, whereas heightened societal demand enhances this tendency as it can increase MNEs’ perception of the benefits of climate innovation. We find evidence for our hypotheses in a panel of MNEs listed in the United States from 1995 to 2017. Our study contributes to resource dependence theory and extends our understanding of climate innovation as a viable solution to climate change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Community participation is recognized as a crucial yet problematic element for addressing many issues in social development. Generating participation, however, is particularly challenging due to existing inequalities within heterogeneous communities, making it difficult for organizations to engage marginalized groups while letting go of their own control. We explore how organizations facilitate community participation through a qualitative comparative case study of two community radio stations in India. We find two approaches based on how organizations leverage three levels of influence: (1)open participation workleverages community members as audience and volunteers/staff by drawing on commonality between them. Furthermore, it defers decision making to community hierarchy; (2)protective participation workengages audience and volunteers/staff from marginalized groups, focusing on their differences from other community members, and defies community hierarchy in decision making. These two approaches led to contrasting outcomes: open participation work led to a pliable organization that invited the community in, but preserved community inequalities, and protective participation work led to a directive organization that restricted participation, but disrupted community inequalities. In unpacking these approaches, we extend the social‐symbolic work literature by theorizing how participation work creates entangled effects on the organization and community.</content>

    <title>What If We Are the WEIRD Ones? A Call (and Roadmap) for More Non-WEIRD Entrepreneurship Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship researchers have focused on WEIRD samples—that is, Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic samples. This editorial suggests that not all theories formed on and tested with WEIRD samples are generalizable to non-WEIRD contexts. A richer picture of entrepreneurial phenomena can come from non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research, especially (but not exclusively) by non-WEIRD researchers with local knowledge and interests. In this editorial, we hope to motivate more non-WEIRD entrepreneurship research by highlighting the potential problems with the dominance of a WEIRD perspective in our most impactful research, introducing each element of a non-WEIRD approach to solve those problems, and offering some big-picture thoughts and methods as future research opportunities. Indeed, we provide research opportunities that could lead to contextualized entrepreneurship theories embedded in contexts not well represented in the mainstream entrepreneurship literature, largely devoted to the WEIRD. We conclude this editorial with recommendations for reviewers and editors of these mainstream entrepreneurship journals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use publicly available information to estimate the country location of multinational firms’ cash holdings, examine why investors discount the value of cash held overseas, and examine whether that discount changes after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. We provide three main results. First, our firm-year foreign cash estimates are reasonably accurate, evidenced by high correlations with simulated data and proprietary country-level data, high adjusted R2when explaining a firm’s total cash holdings, and the ability to replicate prior findings. Second, we demonstrate that investors value foreign cash holdings more negatively than domestic cash holdings when the cash is held in high agency-cost countries. Finally, we find that investors no longer appear to discount foreign cash after the TCJA, when the U.S. moved from a worldwide to a quasi-territorial taxation system.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should the seller display all available products in a setting with multiple products or only offer a subset? Is there a benefit of withholding some products? The seller does not want to display low-margin products due to cannibalization, but what if all products have the same margin? In “Performance of the Offer-Everything Policy,” W. T. Huh, J. Paat, and M. Queyranne argue that in an environment where the seller cannot adjust assortment based on customer types, it is best to offer all available products in an environment. The analysis is based on competitive ratio and expected revenue. This research assures that a common practice of truthfully revealing product availability is a generally good policy to follow.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although experimental design often focuses on selecting the single best alternative from a finite set, many pure-exploration problems pursue richer goals. Given a specific goal, adaptive experimentation aims to achieve it by strategically allocating sampling effort, with the underlying sample complexity characterized by a maximin optimization problem. In "Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration," Qin and You introduce a unified dual-directed framework for efficiently solving general pure-exploration problems, yielding a unified algorithm design principle that extends the top-two approach beyond best-arm identification. Their theoretical analysis proves asymptotic optimality for classical problems, such as Gaussian best-arm identification, thresholding bandits, and epsilon-best-arm identification. Extensive numerical experiments confirm these theoretical insights, showcasing significant improvements over existing methods. This dual-directed framework offers researchers and practitioners a powerful and versatile tool to navigate uncertainty and optimize exploration strategies effectively.</content>

    <title>Tending to the Particular: Navigating Tensions Around Principles of Alternativity Through an Ethics of Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alternative organizations must continuously address conflicts that emerge regarding diverging prioritizations and interpretations of autonomy, solidarity, and responsibility. We explore how tensions around alternative moral principles can be navigated through relational processes that attune to others' needs, emotions, and concerns. Building on an organizational ethnography of a cooperative campaign agency, we mobilize ethics of care as a research lens to trace and analyse how relational activities that are infused by an ethical attention to particular others assist the organization in dealing with these tensions. Our findings show that three relational activities – inquiring, deliberating, and responding – constitute a “relational tension‐navigation circuit” that enables the alternative organization to evoke, map, and situatively settle tensions around alternative principles by embracing the vulnerability, plurality, and flourishing of others. We contribute to relational, ethical, and processual research in alternative organizing by showing how the particular and the general can be productively enfolded in alternative organizations. Furthermore, we conceptualize a broad, ethically and relationally grounded understanding of revisability that supports alternative organizations in finding targeted adaptations and provisional solutions to address conflicts and tensions.</content>

    <title>When do Firms with New CEOs Engage in M&amp;amp;A? Understanding the Timing of New CEOs' First M&amp;amp;A Announcements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New CEO appointments can create strategic uncertainty for stakeholders, potentially undermining the CEO's position. While the stakeholder uncertainty perspective suggests CEOs may act boldly to clarify their strategic intentions during early tenure, the CEO life cycle perspective proposes that CEOs avoid such moves during early tenure, as they still need to learn. This study integrates these views to examine whether and when new CEOs under high strategic uncertainty make bold strategic choices during early tenure. Focusing on first acquisitions – especially large and cross‐border deals – we argue that new CEOs have a higher hazard of announcing an acquisition under high strategic uncertainty, namely, outsider CEOs and those whose appointments were more negatively received. Leveraging the time CEOs spend in their role as a conceptual bridge between the two perspectives, we argue that the acquisition hazard under high strategic uncertainty increases over early tenure, as CEOs gather information and learn. Analysing 873 new US CEOs (2004–2020) with an extended Cox hazard model, we find a generally higher hazard of first acquisition announcements for outsider CEOs and those with more negative appointment reactions, especially for bolder deals. Evidence on time dependence is mixed, but more pronounced for outsider CEOs and large acquisitions.</content>

    <title>The Role of Observed Punishment in Deterring the Spillover Effects of Corporate Misconduct Among Non‐Peers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates (1) whether misreporting by corporate executives impacts unethical decision‐making by non‐peers in unrelated reporting tasks, and (2) whether observing various forms of punishment for corporate misreporting deters this spillover effect. Specifically, we examine the deterrent effects of two common forms of punishment (fines or imprisonment) and a novel form of punishment (public shaming). Across two experiments, we find that participants are more likely to misreport performance when exposed to media reports about executives engaging in financial misreporting. This evidence is consistent with executive misreporting leading to unethical decision‐making among non‐peer observers. We also find that participant misreporting is reduced when the media reports the punishments levied against those executives. In further mediation tests, our findings suggest observed punishments for corporate misconduct can influence perceptions of injunctive norms and potentially mitigate spillover in unethical behavior.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Effectiveness of Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Chinese Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global shift from face-to-face instruction to online learning, posing new operational challenges for business schools, particularly in equipping students with quantitative skills essential for the labor market. Leveraging China’s abrupt lockdown policies as a natural experiment, we examine the heterogeneous effects of online education on student academic performance. Using a panel dataset of 15,329 observations from 7,867 undergraduate students across nine Chinese universities over four semesters (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), we compare academic outcomes before and during the transition to online learning. We find that online education led to an average increase of 8 to 11 points in mathematics scores on a 100-point scale during the pandemic. Applying principal component analysis, we identify four key policy measures that capture lockdown stringency: stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, public transportation suspension, and public information campaigns. Stricter stay-at-home orders issued by the government reduce the effectiveness of online learning; however, these negative effects are partially offset by increased parental supervision and reduced external distractions resulting from workplace closures and the suspension of public transportation. Further, online learning is more effective for reasoning-focused courses (e.g., mathematics) than interpretation-focused courses (e.g., English), and the academic benefits of face-to-face peer interactions diminish significantly in online settings relative to offline environments. Our findings offer actionable insights for managing educational delivery during operational disruptions, highlighting the importance of tailoring online curriculum design and support systems to course content and student mobility constraints.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Measuring Consistency in Service Delivery: Examining the Effect of Process Standardization on Hospital Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare services provided to patients with similar medical conditions are known to vary. Standardization of healthcare delivery is a relatively new, yet hotly debated approach to address clinical variations. Previous research on process standardization in health service delivery has focused on measuring adherence to established protocols available only for a limited set of medical conditions. We create an alternate construct that quantifies process standardization measured in terms of consistency in services rendered, and apply it in a healthcare context using detailed nonpublic inpatient discharge data from about 35 million inpatient stays at acute care hospitals in California between 2008-2016. We examine the impact of such process standardization on the cost, quality, and variation in quality of care delivered at the hospital, operating unit, and medical condition level. We find that process standardization is associated with reductions in cost per discharge, readmission rate and variation in readmission rates at the hospital level. We also find that the impact of process standardization varies across different operating units and medical conditions, providing cost and quality benefit in majority of cases. We further conduct post-hoc analysis on the degree of process standardization, finding that higher rates of capacity utilization and complexity of patient disease mix is associated with a lower process standardization, while increasing focus and process adherence is associated with an increase in process standardization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While prior research has examined organizational‐ and CEO‐level antecedents to mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) capabilities, less is known about how those below the CEO may shape the ways in which firms conduct acquisitions. In this study, I argue that Corporate Development Executives (CDEs), the specialized executives who lead M&amp;A efforts inside companies, also play an important role in the M&amp;A process. Through a hand‐collected dataset on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 information technology (IT) firms, I find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between their prior M&amp;A experience and subsequent M&amp;A performance, and I document the conditions under which CDEs' M&amp;A experience may complement or substitute that of the CEO and the firm. This study contributes to corporate strategy and organizational learning literatures by unveiling novel insights on the microfoundations of M&amp;A capabilities.Managerial SummaryCorporate Development Executives (CDEs) have become increasingly prevalent across organizations, yet their impact on M&amp;A outcomes remains less understood. This study investigates how these specialized executives responsible for leading M&amp;A inside organizations influence acquisition outcomes through their prior experience. Using detailed data on CDEs in S&amp;P 500 IT firms, I find an inverted‐U relationship between CDEs' prior M&amp;A experience and M&amp;A performance, and that their abilities to shape M&amp;A outcomes can be further enhanced or limited, depending on the experiences of the CEO and the firm. By unpacking the interactions among these different M&amp;A experiences, this work offers important managerial implications on how firms should select and manage their M&amp;A human capital as they continue to build M&amp;A capabilities in pursuit of superior firm performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using signaling theory, this research examines the role that social support during pregnancy plays in reducing work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave. Specifically, we consider four sources of social support (two from the work domain: supervisor and coworkers; and two from the non-work domain: spouse and friends) and the signaling effect they have on a mother’s work–family guilt upon returning to work after maternity leave and her subsequent job and family satisfaction. Based on a sample of 247 women who completed surveys both before taking maternity leave and upon returning to the workforce, we found that supervisor, coworker, and friend support enhanced job satisfaction through reduced work-induced guilt. Further, both supervisor and spouse support contributed to family satisfaction through reduced family-induced guilt. Spouse support reduced family-induced guilt significantly more than coworker support, offering some modest support for domain specificity. Further, when considering the interaction of within-domain effects, we found that the work domain sources of support interact to provide a stronger effect on job satisfaction, but the non-work domain sources do not interact significantly. This provides an enlightening look at social support’s different roles in working mom guilt during a pivotal time in a woman’s life, her return to work after childbirth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Introducing a new measure of scientific proximity between private firms and public research groups and exploiting a multi-billion euro financing program of academic clusters in France, we provide causal evidence of local spillovers from academic research to firms in the private sector. Our main estimate suggests that each euro spent in academic research through this program spurred an additional 0.81 euros in private R&amp;D expenditures. We also show that this shock increased the average quality of patents. We exploit reports produced by funded clusters, complemented by data on firm creation, labor mobility and R&amp;D public–private partnerships, to provide evidence on the channels for these spillovers. We discuss the policy implications of funding academic research to stimulate private R&amp;D.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some Bilinear Optimization Problems Are Surprisingly Easy to SolveBilinear terms in a continuous optimization problem are computationally challenging and are typically addressed with global optimization techniques or McCormick-based relaxations. In “Hidden convexity in a class of optimization problems with bilinear terms,” Gorissen, den Hertog, and Reusken discover a reformulation technique that provides an equivalent convex formulation that is solvable in polynomial time for a rich subclass of problems. The subclass is characterized by products of variables where one variable is nonnegative and the other variable interacts only with variables that are multiplied with the same nonnegative variable. Their finding provides a new avenue to efficiently solve inverse optimization problems, nonlinear robust optimization problems via their dual problem, and problems with variable coefficients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate investors’ disagreement regarding firm news and assess its ability to predict stock returns. Specifically, we quantify firm-level investor disagreement through the volume-volatility elasticity surrounding firm news; higher elasticity is associated with less investor disagreement. Intuitively, disagreement introduces additional trading motives that are not driven by price changes, weakening the connection between volume and volatility. Our findings indicate that investor disagreement on news negatively predicts cross-sectional returns. We also present empirical evidence aligned with the theoretical predictions of a recently developed model by Atmaz and Basak (Journal of Finance 73 (3): 1225–1279 2018) that the negative disagreement-stock relation strengthens when the optimism effect dominates the uncertainty effect. Importantly, this predictive relationship remains robust after controlling for news heterogeneity, other volume- and volatility-based measures, and alternative channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how global changes in information acquisition costs through disclosure technologies affect price informativeness. To explore this issue, we examine worldwide adoptions of centralized electronic disclosure systems, which significantly reduce the cost of and broaden access to financial disclosures. Consistent with theory, we show a significant reduction in private information acquisition around earnings announcements as a result of these adoptions. These effects are most pronounced in countries with the most substantial reductions in information acquisition costs and where we find more significant decreases in informed trade. Overall, we highlight an important, unintended cost of broadening access to financial disclosures through technology adoptions.</content>

    <title>Distributional Growth Accounting: Education and the Reduction of Global Poverty, 1980-2019</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article quantifies the role played by education in the reduction of global poverty. I propose tools for identifying the contribution of schooling to economic growth by income group, integrating imperfect substitution between skill groups into macroeconomic growth decomposition. I bring this “distributional growth accounting” framework to the data by exploiting a new microdatabase representative of nearly all of the world’s population, new estimates of the private returns to schooling, and historical income distribution statistics. Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education. Because they ignore the distributional effects of schooling, standard growth accounting methods substantially underestimate economic benefits of education for the global poor.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multilocation, Dynamic Staff Planning for a Healthcare System: Methodology and ApplicationThis study develops and implements a robust optimization model for dynamically assigning anesthesiologists across multiple hospitals in a large health system. The model addresses uncertainty in surgical demand by incorporating a three-stage decision process: presurgical location assignments, midhorizon on-call deployment, and day-of realization of overtime or idleness. The authors formulate the problem as a multistage robust mixed-integer program and solve it efficiently using a novel nested column and constraint generation algorithm. The approach accounts for location-specific constraints and fairness in on-call duties using historical data to estimate demand uncertainty with a calibrated trade-off between optimality and robustness. Implemented at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the model reduced annual staffing costs by 12% or roughly $800,000 compared to existing practice. The framework is generalizable to other staffing problems in healthcare and provides operational insights on the value of forecast accuracy, location flexibility, and equitable workload distribution.</content>

    <title>Setting the Stage: Line Managers' &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Orientation as an Antecedent to Perceived &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Effectiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The field of strategic human resource (HR) management has shown an increasing focus on how employees perceive and react to their organization's HR practices. In this perspective, employees are not passive recipients of HR policies or mere observers of their managers' HR implementation strategies. Rather, their perceptions play a critical role in shaping organizational culture and fostering high‐performing workplaces. However, important questions remain regarding how line management roles shape not only employees' assessments of their work environment but also their perceptions of HR effectiveness. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, we argue that line managers' compliance‐ versus commitment‐focused orientations influence employee appraisals of threats and challenges in their jobs. These appraisals, in turn, shape how employees evaluate the effectiveness of their organization's HR practices (i.e., perceived HR effectiveness). Using qualitative data from focus groups and a multilevel quantitative research design, we find evidence supporting our hypotheses, showing that line managers' HR orientations significantly influence employees' cognitive appraisals and subsequent perceptions of HR effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical contributions and offering practical recommendations for improving the implementation of HR practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bayesian Learning for Data-Driven Stochastic Optimal ControlStochastic optimal control (SOC) provides a principled approach to dynamic decision making under uncertainty. It models the transition of the system state with a dynamic equation driven by randomness, with the assumption that the distribution of randomness is known. However, in practical problems, modeling randomness frequently depends on data or observations, which introduces uncertainty regarding the distribution of randomness. To address the data-driven SOC problem, in “Episodic Bayesian Optimal Control with Unknown Randomness Distributions,” Shapiro, Zhou, Lin, and Wang propose a new approach that incorporates Bayesian learning with optimal control in an episodic manner. They show the convergence and convergence rate results for their approach. They also develop an efficient computational method for a class of problems that have convex cost functions and linear state dynamics.</content>

    <title>Unbottling Time: Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty and ‘Time‐Less Organizing’ at a Bottled Water Plant Occupation in Mexico</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how Indigenous Zapatista‐influenced activists enact temporal sovereignty to resist corporate water extraction, challenging dominant Western organizational temporalities. Through qualitative in‐person research of the 2021 occupation of a water bottling plant in Mexico, I explore how activists transformed the site into a non‐capitalist communal space, creating alternative temporal rhythms rooted in Zapatista principles such as ‘walking at the pace of the slowest’ and collective autonomy. The findings reveal how activists rejected efficiency‐driven deadlines, prioritized ecological cycles over productivity metrics, and fostered relational well‐being through inclusive decision‐making. These practices culminated in what I conceptualize as ‘time‐less organizing’ – a framework for non‐capitalist horizontal organizing that operates outside conventional time logics. The study contributes to the management and organizing literature by theorizing temporal sovereignty as resistance to imposed temporalities, extending critiques of stakeholder theory by exposing how corporate temporal constraints perpetuate marginalization, and demonstrating how communities reclaim autonomy through alternative temporal practices. The findings challenge assumptions of time as a resource to be managed for efficiency gains, offering future avenues of research for addressing grand challenges through decelerated and relational approaches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We note that while the institutional environment determines the actions and structures of constituent organizations, there are still limited insights available in the literature on the nature and process of interactions between key stakeholders in ambulance services, especially as they respond during a significant crisis. This study specifically examines how a positive social exchange between senior leadership, managers, and frontline staff, accompanied by changes to the leadership style and HR practices, resulted in significant service transformation. An in‐depth qualitative case study design was used to interview 52 frontline staff and leaders from the UK National Health Service's (NHS) Ambulance Service over a prolonged period of 8 months (October 2020 to May 2021). Interviews and secondary data were abductively analyzed, showing how changes to HRM and leadership practices shaped service transformation's content, process, and logic. The findings suggest that an iterative social exchange between the key social actors in the Ambulance Trust led to adaptations to the nature of HRM and leadership practices, which positively impacted the changes to service delivery, leading to service transformation and improved health and well‐being of paramedics. Our conceptual framework contributes to the literature by integrating how the use of agency, new HRM, and leadership practices in the context of institutionalized structures can result in service transformation. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational socialization and the practice of onboarding new hires are central human resources functions. However, traditional socialization theory and practice were built on assumptions that are increasingly misaligned with today's work context. We identified four current, emerging, and future work trends that characterize the evolving landscape surrounding organizational socialization: technological advancement, the expansion of remote work arrangements, rising societal loneliness and mental health challenges, and aging workforce demographics. Collectively, these trends have contributed to dramatic shifts in the context and performance of work, as well as the expectations that employees and organizations hold for one another. Accordingly, we argue that these shifts require a renewed examination of the organizational socialization process that reflects contemporary realities such as the move away from stable, physically co‐located, psychologically anchored work toward boundaryless, tech‐mediated, and transient work arrangements. Our review presents a future‐forward look at organizational socialization through the lens of these societal and workplace shifts. We identify newcomer adaptability and connection as emergent critical factors for the future of onboarding. Through this lens, we offer practical implications for human resource practice and invite future research that advances our understanding of organizational socialization in today's context.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The perils of legitimacy threats for CBAs are widely acknowledged in the literature. However, prior research has focused on legitimacy threats stemming from factors not in the direct control of MNEs. In this study, we explore if and how acquirers’ CSI salience, a legitimacy threat stemming directly from the past actions and behaviors of the focal firm, influences a critical international expansion decision—the level of ownership obtained in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs). Drawing on neo-institutional theory, we argue that CSI salience reduces the level of ownership obtained in CBAs as it captures more stakeholder attention and is factored into their legitimacy evaluations. In addition, we examine how characteristics of the host country’s legitimating environment may attenuate or accentuate the legitimacy threat from CSI as they reflect how host country stakeholders notice, assess, and respond to CSI and the capacity of host institutions to monitor and enforce compliance. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 16,650 CBAs by 10,738 unique acquirers, and offer valuable insights into the interplay of CSI salience, legitimacy, and CBA ownership to research and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bonuses are notoriously used to motivate workers. How effective are they at doing so, and might there be unintended consequences? We investigated the effectiveness of bonuses based on game profitability on the motivation of video game developers by examining specific bonus characteristics that align with advice derived from expectancy theory. We also investigated if bonuses encouraged or discouraged moral engagement and corner‐cutting behavior through their effects on work motivation as conceptualized through self‐determination theory. Company data on bonus characteristics coupled with surveys from 1024 game developers in a video game company indicated that the size of the last received bonus did not influence current work motivation. Uncertain probability of getting the next bonus installment was related to a lack of motivation, while more certain probability was related to higher intrinsic motivation. The probable size of the next bonus was related to lower external regulation and to higher intrinsic motivation, contrary to predictions from most motivation theories. Both probability certainty and bonus size probability were indirectly negatively associated with moral disengagement and corner‐cutting behaviors via decreasing amotivation and external regulation. Overall, results show that the bonus system in this company had limited effects on motivation and on discouraging deviant behaviors and point to how such systems can be improved using advice from theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a supply chain comprising a downstream retailer and multiple complementary suppliers. Suppliers can form coalitions to jointly invest in sustainable production technologies and enhance the product’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) level. Coalition members benefit from efficiency gains through shared knowledge and information about green production. The retailer sources from these coalitions and sells the product to heterogeneous consumers. We develop a game-theoretical model and use the notion of Nash stability to characterize equilibrium coalition structures and firms’ optimal decisions under three profit allocation rules. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Forming supplier coalitions can benefit all stakeholders (including the retailer, suppliers, and society) but achieving such a win–win–win outcome hinges on two factors: the market’s consciousness rate (i.e., the proportion of socially conscious consumers) and the efficiency gains from coalition formation. (2) The grand coalition that maximizes the retailer’s profit and CSR level is not always stable due to free-riding behaviors. In particular, less efficient suppliers may defect to avoid the cost of sustainable innovation while still benefiting from the high innovation efforts of others (i.e., cross-coalition free-riding). (3) On the supply side, adopting the Shapley value allocation rule exacerbates within-coalition free-riding by assigning greater profit shares to less efficient suppliers. However, it also reduces their incentive to defect, thus enhancing coalition stability. Moreover, greater total efficiency and a smaller efficiency gap among suppliers further improve the stability of the grand coalition. (4) On the demand side, the impact of increasing the market’s consciousness rate is non-monotonic. Improperly influencing consumer awareness may destabilize coalitions and produce unintended consequences, suggesting that the retailer must proceed with caution.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Deep Demand Response Program for Local Electricity Systems</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The decarbonization of power systems facilitates the electrification of appliances, many of which can be operated in a flexible way. Demand response (DR) programs can exploit this flexibility with retail price adjustment, thereby addressing several operational challenges. In this paper, we address the welfare optimization problem of local utilities that procure electricity for their customers at the wholesale market. We demonstrate how DR programs can be designed for local electricity systems where electricity demand and its response to temporary price changes is unknown. For this purpose, we address a novel and complex pricing problem – pricing under unknown, time-interdependent, and discontinuous demand – leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning. Using a numerical case study calibrated on Californian electricity market data, we show that such a “Deep DR program” helps to identify effective prices that improve social welfare. The performance of the program is consistently positive across a variety of system conditions. We further demonstrate that our approach beats Time-of-Use tariff-based benchmarks already after five and a parametric benchmark after 19 simulation days, on average. Second, we provide novel insights regarding an important but frequently overlooked aspect of DR program design: the length of the notification interval, i.e. the timespan for which future prices must be set in advance. We find that the timing of price information is important and that longer notification intervals can improve social welfare. Finally, we provide insights into DR price setting and find that DR prices co-move with wholesale market prices but are lower for longer notification intervals and shorter event sequences. The presented Deep DR program provides an example of how advances in machine learning-based algorithms can help to meet the complex operational requirements of future local electricity systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Managing Quality Risk in a Decentralized Supply Chain: Contractual Incentives and Product Recall Insurance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a two-echelon decentralized supply chain where the probability of selling nondefective products depends on the supplier’s quality improvement and the buyer’s inspection efforts. Products assembled from defective components cause a recall that leads to external failure costs for the buyer. Both players’ efforts are not contractible and it is a challenge to align inspection and quality-improvement efforts in a decentralized supply chain. We find that a procurement contract can provide preventive incentives that induce high inspection efforts and enhancing incentives that enable the supplier to credibly commit to high-quality components. However, these contractual incentives only align two players’ efforts under certain conditions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that introducing a product recall (PR) insurance requirement into a standard procurement contract provided by the buyer can complement enhancing incentives and lead to quality improvement in components. More importantly, as PR insurance can improve the flexibility of risk-sharing arrangements between the supplier and the buyer, we show that it can also serve as a coordinating role in improving the performance of a decentralized supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Multi-Warehouse Assortment Selection: Minimizing Order Splitting in E-commerce Logistics</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Order splitting is one of the key issues in the e-commerce order fulfillment process. It increases operational costs, elevates carbon emissions, and compromises customer satisfaction. This paper focuses on determining the product assortments to store within the multi-warehouse logistics network to minimize the total number of split orders subject to cardinality constraints. We show that this minimizing split orders (MSO) problem is NP-hard and demonstrate that even finding an optimal order fulfillment strategy with a given assortment selection is NP-hard. To further analyze the MSO problem, we introduce a concept termedthe second-order dominant indexing rule. This indexing rule corresponds to a group of demand distributions, under which we are able to characterize the structure of the optimal assortment selection for various scenarios. In particular, when assortment overlapping is prohibited, the optimal selection can be explicitly derived. When the demand exhibits a total nested structure, an optimal selection is non-overlapping with more popular products allocated to larger warehouses. We also bridge the two-warehouse order splitting minimization problem with the single-warehouse assortment selection problem in the literature. Building upon this connection, we propose an Extended Marginal Choice Indexing (MCI) policy, which is proven to achieve optimality when the demand has a second-order dominant MCI. In addition, we propose an Iterative Improvement Heuristic that refines any existing assortment selection. The efficiency of the proposed heuristics is validated by extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating that the extended MCI policy performs near-optimally even when customer demand is not ideal, and both heuristics outperform the best benchmark in existing literature. Additional experiments on real-world data further confirm their effectiveness and scalability. Finally, we extend our findings to a two-tier multi-warehouse scenario with a back-end warehouse.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends the canonical harm reduction approach to a wider set of applications, including conservation. We develop an economic model to illustrate the trade-offs inherent to harm reduction, weighing the benefits of reducing harm against the risk of drawing those previously abstaining into consumption, and identify contexts where it is not applicable. Using sequential campaigns with embedded experimentation that enables measurement, we market a harm reduction solution in the context of water conservation. We show that a smart irrigation controller that efficiently maintains stigmatized ornamental landscapes appeals to the heaviest irrigators and generates large and long-lasting individual and social benefits: cost recovery in six months and water savings covering another household’s basic needs. We find no evidence it cannibalizes abstinence (lawn removal) or increases irrigation by conservation-prone individuals. Our conceptual and measurement framework provides a foundation for implementing and evaluating harm reduction well beyond the typical drug and public health contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Experience with a product is shaped by two things: (i) aspects of the product itself and (ii) aspects of the environment in which the product is consumed. This paper documents evidence that when translating their experiences into ratings for products, consumers overly attribute their experience to products, and under-attribute experience to context—the environment in which the product is consumed. First, 218,918 ratings collected from REI.com demonstrate that ratings for cold-weather gear (products designed to keep people warm) are positively correlated with temperature: These products get lower ratings when the weather is cold and higher ratings when the weather is warm, controlling for climate and season. Ratings for other products (e.g., bicycles, tents, skis) are not affected by temperature. This effect generalizes to other products and contexts both in the REI data (e.g., rain jackets and rain) and in a laboratory experiment. The paper also identifies attenuating conditions for this effect. Specifically, the effect seems to be smaller when reviewers explicitly consider context, and when context information is made more accessible, while rating. These findings inform several possible interventions for platforms, which are assessed and validated.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Growth Department: The Emerging Role and Impact of Chief Growth Officers and their Cross-Functional Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates “growth departments,” an increasingly popular governance structure in modern organizations. Using a multimethod approach across five studies, the authors examine the purpose, responsibilities, and effectiveness of these departments. In Studies 1A and 1B the authors analyze job ads to understand the growth department. Study 2 expands this understanding via interviews with Chief Growth Officers. Findings show that the growth department is a cross-functional unit distinct from marketing and sales departments, designed to unify and orchestrate growth throughout the organization. Studies 3 and 4 assess their impact on firm outcomes, drawing from boundary spanning and organizational ambidexterity theories. In startups, hiring a growth leader results in better advancement through funding rounds, a key proxy of startup growth, than hiring a marketing or sales leader (Study 3). In public firms, a powerful growth department improves performance metrics including Tobin’s Q, cash flow, and ROA (Study 4). The paper also identifies contingency factors influencing the growth department’s effectiveness, including the growth leader’s past sales or marketing experience and the firm’s strategic emphasis on exploration versus exploitation. Together, the findings advance theory and practice by clarifying what growth departments are, how they operate, and under what conditions they enhance firm performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Breaking Up to Move Forward: The Value Gains of Alliance Terminations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior alliance research in marketing has largely focused on factors enhancing alliance stability. Yet also alliance terminations can be valuable. They are intricately linked with firms’ strategies to (re)allocate resources to create financial value. The basic premise of this study is that an alliance termination increases firm value when investors interpret it as the firm’s intention to reallocate resources towards more promising market opportunities. The key question is how investors arrive at that interpretation. The prior literature suggests that the diversity of a firm’s alliance portfolio informs investors about its resource (re)allocation strategy. This argument relies on three assumptions: (1) firms face uncertainty, (2) resources invested in the terminated alliance are redeployable, and (3) the diverse alliance portfolio offers resource reallocation opportunities. These assumptions form the basis for the development of a contingency framework. Moderators are identified to capture (1) firms’ competitive environment and exposure to macroeconomic risk, (2) the fungible nature versus alliance-specificity of resources invested in the terminated alliance, and (3) efficiency and overlap with the other alliances in the portfolio. An event study of 427 firm-alliance termination announcements during 1985-2020 supports the predictions. The combined findings shed new light on alliance terminations, contributing to marketing theory and practice.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Too Painful to Donate: Why Don’t People Donate to Critical Illness Campaigns?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charitable donations are increasingly shifting to online fundraising platforms, where numerous campaigns are displayed simultaneously. This research examines the role of campaign titles in attracting online traffic in this competitive environment, focusing specifically on a major category of medical fundraising. While fundraisers commonly include the names of critical illnesses in campaign titles (critical illness titles), our findings suggest that this emotion-laden driver can negatively impact donation performance. A series of seven studies—combining secondary data, field and controlled experiments—provides robust evidence for this undesirable critical illness title effect. Moreover, three studies offer mediation and moderation evidence showing that anticipated distress drives this effect. Donors tend to avoid critical illness title campaigns, opting instead for alternatives that still allow them to express empathy. However, this effect diminishes when there is a non-distress cue or when the alternatives are non-justifiable. This research contributes to the literature on charitable crowdfunding, prosocial behavior, and title effect, offering important practical implications for fundraisers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: More Ads, More Viewers? Analyzing Behavioral Shifts from Advertising Permissions to Live Streaming Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There has been little exploration on how audience content consumption may change in response to advertising permissions on live streaming platforms. Ads are utilized by brands to generate revenue through ad exposure, but is this benefit thwarted by the reduction of audience consumption of content? Using a dataset containing over 12 million observations in the live streaming space and a difference-in-differences estimation approach, we study the effects of a policy intervention by a live streaming platform which provided (some) streamers the ability to display mid-roll advertisements (MRAs). Although the ad avoidance literature infers that ad-supported content should be viewed unfavorably by audiences, our results indicate that providing the mere ability to introduce MRAs has a notable positive effect on live streaming content consumption (average viewership and total hours watched). We discover that a viable explanation for this response is through increases in broadcasting airtime, stream frequency (somewhat) and quality by streamers after the intervention, as these adjustments are drastically easier to implement in a live streaming setting when compared to more “traditional” forms of media. We further explore heterogeneity in these effects in relation to initial success, streaming tenure, content activity, culture (of the streamer), and impact across time.</content>

    <title>Internal Forecasts in Multi‐Location Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the dynamics of internal forecasting in multi‐location firms and the relations between forecast characteristics and investment. Using U.S. Census microdata on plant‐level growth expectations, we find that plants within multi‐location firms make forecasts that are both more certain and less accurate than those of standalone plants. We provide evidence suggesting that headquarters infers uncertainty from inter‐plant forecast disagreement, and that headquarters is able to facilitate the use of relevant information held by one plant but applicable to another. Differences between peer and focal plants' forecasts predict forecast errors and relate to investment decisions at the focal plant, suggesting that information from multiple sources is integrated into capital allocation decisions. Headquarters' heavier use of peer plant forecast information when focal plants are more uncertain likely weakens focal plant managers' incentives to consider extreme scenarios when forecasting.</content>

    <title>Bunch of jerks: How brands can benefit by reappropriating insults</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands are increasingly finding themselves on the receiving end of negative labels from a variety of sources. While sometimes warranted, many of these negative labels feel like unwarranted or uncivil insults. Brands generally respond to such undeserved degradation by ignoring the insult, denying the insult, or perhaps apologizing to the insulter. This research explores another potential strategy: reappropriating the insult. We reveal that reappropriation—an intentional act of verbatim self‐labeling with an externally imposed negative label—can garner unexpected benefits for brands, including greater advertisement click‐through rate, interest, and more positive attitudes. The advantage of reappropriation is driven by perceptions of the brand's confidence and humor and is specific to situations in which the reappropriated insult is perceived to be unjustified and ultimately benign in nature. This work contributes to our understanding of how brands can recover from negative events and how reappropriation operates uniquely in an unexplored marketplace context. We also provide a novel recovery tactic for brand managers facing certain types of hostility.</content>

    <title>From Workplace‐Based to Work‐Related Violence: Reframing &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Research and Practice in the Era of Growing Tensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Violence at work has traditionally been conceptualized in human resource management (HRM) as workplace‐based violence—an episodic, interpersonal issue occurring within bounded organizational settings. This perspective article adopts the term work‐related violence as a more expansive and timely framing, encompassing physical, psychological, and symbolic harm related to work but occurring across dispersed geographies, identities, relationships, and organizational arrangements. It contends that prevailing HRM frameworks remain ill‐equipped to address these fragmented and often unacknowledged harms, particularly as work becomes increasingly hybrid, precarious, and digitally mediated. Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship, we advance a multilevel and multistakeholder analytical framework that theorizes violence as relational and spatially unbounded, embedded across micro (identity and employees' lived experience, and psychological factors), meso (organizational culture, HRM systems and silencing mechanisms), and macro (regulatory, ideological, and institutional) levels. The framework further identifies underexplored domains of violence within HRM, including employee‐perpetrated violence, ideologically motivated aggression, and the critical role of community‐based interventions in mitigating harm. In doing so, the article contributes to HRM theory by problematizing the spatial and behavioral assumptions underpinning conventional approaches to workplace violence. We argue for a broadened research and practice agenda that expands the field's analytical and operational capacity, calling for the development of HRM models that are structurally, institutionally, and ideologically attuned to violence emerging from inequality, institutional complicity, and the broader political economies of contemporary work.</content>

    <title>Investor Memory and Biased Beliefs: Evidence from the Field</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey a large, representative sample of retail investors in China to elicit their memories of stock market investments and their return expectations. We merge these survey data with administrative transaction data to test a model in which investors selectively recall past experiences to form their beliefs. Our analysis uncovers new facts about investor memory and highlights similarity-based recall as a key mechanism of belief formation in financial markets. A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns. Recalled experiences can explain cross-investor variation in return expectations and, in our setting, dominate actual experiences in their explanatory power. In the transaction data, we confirm that recalled experiences are reflected in investors’ trading decisions through a belief channel.</content>

    <title>&lt;scp&gt;HPWP&lt;/scp&gt; Climate, Collective Well‐Being, and Firm Performance in &lt;scp&gt;SMEs&lt;/scp&gt;: An Exchange Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on High‐Performance Work Practices (HPWP) typically examines employees' aggregated HPWP perceptions and their impact on organizational outcomes. We argue that variability in these perceptions also matters due to its impact on collective exchange relationships. We integrate the aggregated (mean) level HPWP perceptions and variability regarding HPWP perceptions to identify four HPWP climate types: a strong HPWP climate (high mean, low variability) and three weak HPWP climates—unshared high (high variability, high mean), shared low (low variability, low mean), and unshared low (high variability, low mean). Using data from 695 employees in 72 Belgian SMEs, we find that a strong HPWP climate is optimal as it relates to the highest collective social and lowest economic exchange levels, which are—in turn—associated with high collective affective organizational commitment (CAOC) and subjective firm performance. However, it is also linked to high collective exhaustion, showing that aligning organizational and workforce interests is not always possible. As regards the weak climates, they are suboptimal, with shared low climates being particularly detrimental. Even though these climates can be fruitful for firm performance, they are linked to lower levels of CAOC, which can be harmful for SMEs that rely heavily on the effort and engagement of their employees. These findings show that investing in HPWP is fruitful for SMEs, even though they have limited financial means, and that SMEs also need to handle the inherent tensions present in HRM.</content>
